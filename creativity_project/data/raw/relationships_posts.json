      "title": "[UPDATE - 7 years later] For years, my [35F] husband [37M] said that if I want stability in our life, I have to make it happen. I did. And now things are worse than ever. Help?",
      "content": "I was recently cleaning out my bookmarks and [found this old throwaway](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/9tdkqa/for_years_my_35f_husband_37m_said_that_if_i_want/), and obviously the two posts I made with it. I'm not sure why now, but I feel compelled to write a followup. Maybe it'll give people the bravery to change or at least an example of how sticking with what you know isn't always the best choice.\n\nAn obviously very long story short, with the help of those posts and a lot of long nights of thinking, I left my husband. In fact, it took him going away for a long weekend to realize how much happier and at peace I felt without him around... At first the split was amicable, but looking back I think he was just waiting for me to come rushing back to him once I \"realized my mistake.\" When that didn't happen and he could see I was actually serious about building a new life for myself, a switch flipped. We only spoke when he needed something from me and eventually that stopped too. Enough about him.\n\nI'm now 42, happier and healthier and more satisfied than I've been my whole life. I picked me and that was the best choice I could've ever made. I lived alone for the first time and my god, the peace of having my own space... unrivaled. I ended up staying in that apartment for 5 years, not a moving box in sight. I put art on the walls, I knew my neighbors. I made a home. I grew my career and went back to school. Made friends, built a little community.\n\nI've done a ton of therapy and realized that the abusive patterns my parents created in childhood were just repeating with my ex. I fell in love, a real love, a supportive love that encourages growth and security. I'm doing new work, work that helps people and is so much more than just chasing money. All of those things have created a life that's more rewarding than I ever thought possible for myself.\n\nI've gone through some really shitty times too, illness, cancer scares, deaths, loss... but I have no idea how I would've come out the other side without the community I'd built around me. Even something as simple as people at your local coffee shop recognizing you is a comfort after feeling adrift and alone for so long. Anyway, if I were to respond to myself from 7 years ago, this is what I would say.\n\n>Leave the loser. He doesn't care about you, never did. He only cares about what you can do for him and now that you aren't serving him... well. Just go. You are capable of doing difficult things, and you are worthy of the work it takes to accomplish them. Trust your abilities, trust your gut - it's been screaming at you for years now, honey. Life can be so much more than you've experienced, but you have to make it happen for yourself. \n\n**TL;DR:** Left my husband, happier than ever.",

      "title": "Husband’s best friend acting romantically interested in me suddenly",
      "content": "My husband's best friend's behavior for the past three months has been out of character for him. He acts as if he has romantic interest in me. I feel I am at the point where I need to talk to H but need to know if I am making an issue out of a non-issue or if my stress is valid.\n\nAll three of us come from traditional Greek-American families. HBF is literally like a brother to H. They grew up together. H and I have been married since our early 20s and all three of us are in our mid/late 30s now.\n\nHBF is currently single. He is divorced with no kids. Its been years since his divorce. HBF is very close to our kids, particularly our oldest son because they bond over football stuff as HBF played football in college and son looks up to him. \n\nSelect out of character behavior:\n1. Had a family beach day. I needed to reapply sunscreen to my back, which I'm usually able to do on my own, but he saw me and volunteered to help and said I got you. I told him no thanks I got it. He insisted and said let me help, and I semi yelled at him with no I'm good really. My husband was not paying attention and in his sun daze.\n\n2. Family dinner out.  H went to the bathroom, HBF who had several drinks in his system told me that I looked particularly hot tonight. My kids were right there. I was so embarrassed and reacted with what bro which is something I would never say, but felt the need to react with something guy'sh. He laughed and said bro?\n\n3. Over for dinner, randomly asked, with my H present,  if he could see old clips from my ballet performances. H reacts with WTF?  HBF who is super into lifting and gym stuff as a hobby said he wanted to see what a female ballet dancer's physique looks like at peak performance. H cracked some joke and laughed and asked if he could share the clips he had on his phone. I said yeah ok, trying not to overthink it or make a fuss about it.\n\n4. HBF will pick up our son from practice sometimes because his work schedule is flexible. Yesterday, when he dropped him off at my studio, he came in which he never does. I was still teaching. He said hi and before leaving he rubbed my back and held my shoulder and said let me know how I can help out more with the kids. They are the highlight of my day. This was all in front of my son who is a teen. I did not appreciate his physical touch at all. I reacted with why have you been acting so weird lately and he just laughed it off and said what do you mean? I didn't have time to talk as I was in the middle of teaching and just told him nvm.\n\nTL;DR: HBF has as of recent engaged in subtle behaviors which make me feel uncomfortable, as if he is suddenly romantically interested in me. H whose mind is very occupied with work seems completely oblivious. No life changing event for HBF to trigger this behavior. Do I talk to H or ignore the issue? Is it even an issue? \n",

      "title": "My partner is allowed to have bad days but I’m not.",
      "content": "Title makes it sound worse than it is. My boyfriend (24M) and I (22F) have been dating for only about 10 months. He struggles with depression and has for a very long time, way before we met. I knew this going into the relationship and wasn’t expecting to ‘fix him’ or anything. The challenge pt. 1 is that he often has hard days, like really really hard days. Never threatens anything drastic but will completely shut down and shut me out. I will only hear from him again (besides a text back here and there if I text him first) after a few days when he is ready for my support. This has happened enough times (about one week every month) that I know the drill and it doesn’t really affect me anymore. I know that when he’s ready he’ll reach out and will be able to ask for what he needs to feel better and I will be there for him at the drop of a hat. Until then I’ll just do my own thing and try not to crowd him. The challenge pt. 2 is that it’s not very often that I have a hard day. I’m pretty good at self-regulating my emotions and managing them on my own (several years of therapy later). However I’ve had an incredibly stressful last month or so. My dad had an intense medical emergency that’s only just calmed down a bit a few days ago, I’m in the middle of moving across town while simultaneously searching for people to take over my current living situation, I am trying to get myself back into school so I have a ton of stuff I need to do to get enrolled in university, work, friends, life in general, etc. I will admit when I’m overly stressed and overwhelmed I can sometimes become quite a downer, I know this, this is why I will usually just put myself in time out in the corner until I’m regulated again. Boyfriend wants to be supportive and I appreciate that. He invited me over for dinner last night and asked me to open up about my stress, so I did. And then he asked me to leave. Because my emotions made him feel worse. So now I’ve shared with him how I’m feeling and it has shifted to him now being sad and feeling helpless and “needing some space”. In his defense I can be very stubborn about not wanting to feel better when I feel overwhelmed, but it’s the classic thing of ‘I don’t want you to try to fix this. I know it will be okay. I just wanted to tell you how I’m feeling’. I left at like 11 pm because “my being there was making him feel worse.” This feels pretty classic in our relationship and certainly is not the first time this has happened. Safe to say I feel super frustrated and went to bed questioning our relationship. It just kind of feels like he made my bad day about him? Maybe that’s a selfish take but it’s just not surprising to me that it went down that way. Maybe I should actually be posting this in AITAH? but I guess i just don’t know what to do? Do I just assume that my boyfriend is not the person I go to for emotional support?? Or just cut my losses as I’m young and we haven’t been dating for super long and end the relationship? Not sure if I’m being irrational. \n\nTL;DR, my boyfriend has bad days all the time and I am there to help him whenever he needs it but he doesn’t extend the same energy to me when I need support.",

      "content": "I 28/F’ have been with my boyfriend ‘M/30’ for almost 5 years now. It started off amazing and obviously we had a couple of rough patches like any other realtionship would. All of a sudden however it seems like we are stuck in this roommate phase and it’s driving me crazy.\nIt’s been almost two years now being like this. I try to talk to him about it but he tells me that has nothing has changed. This guy was obsessed with me and now even to get a kiss from him or hug him I have to initiate it. Our intimate life is a disaster. Weeks go by without being intimate and it seems like it doesn’t bother him and I don’t think that it’s normal for a guy. I am always the one who brings the subject. He tells me that it’s not fair that he has to be the one who initiates it. Everytime it’s a different excuse. I am always the affectionate one, and I get it that not everyone is the same but lately I feel that he is only with me because he feels safe and comfortable and not because he loves. Whenever I mentioned this he denies it as well. \nWe spend a lot of time together and we also go out etc.. but with regards to affection and intimacy, it’s hopeless. I don’t know what to do next. Any thoughts?\n\nTL;DR - stuck in a roommate phase and want to get the spark back.\n\n\n",

      "content": "Sooo, I’m 27M and shes 28F, been together 8 years. \nI work away a lot but when I get home there was a burning sensation to check her phone, something I never do. We’d had our ups and downs in the past but the last 2/3 years had been really solid, I stumbled across her messaging another guy, only a few messages as the rest appeared deleted. When I approached her about it she denied it but as I put on more pressure she opened up and told me the truth (so I believe anyway)! And it turns out she’d slept with him over 5+ times, sometimes in his car and sometimes at home, she claims it was a purely a friends with benefits style thing and it was all cut off and done with. To make it worse I find out she’d also slept with another guy on one occasion whilst I was away. \n\nAll this was heartbreaking and to much to handle, my life turned upside down and ripped apart, it’s been harder to digest due to having a child together (under 10 years old). We had a solid foundation and I truly thought we were rock solid. I’m still living in the same house and as much as I tried remaining with her I just can’t, she begs for me to stay but I just don’t know what to do? This happened around 6 months ago. What are my next steps and how can I positively move forward? \n\nTL;DR she cheated multiple times, we still live together and she wants to continue being happy together when I don’t think it’s possible after being cheated on multiple times.",

      "content": "Hi y’all, my wife has an incredibly stressful job and has found it very therapeutic to do creative writing. I love that she has a hobby that she loves and can create something, but it’s become very obsessive. The creative writing is fanfiction for an anime, one that I’ve seen some of but it’s not my style and it’s incredibly overhyped now so I don’t care to finish it. \n\nThe hobby started very small, her just writing for a few hours a month. But recently she’s gotten really motivated to rework a fic that she already completed, and branch out and write a whole universe for it. I adore seeing her passionate about something, but it’s taken over a bit. \n\nShe spends hours at her desk on days off writing, brings a notebook to her work so she can write on her free time, and thinks about it on her way home so when she gets home she immediately has to write down her ideas. She works Monday-Friday, and our weekends were always us going on a date and spending time together since it’s the only time we really get one on one time. But the past 4 weekends she doesn’t want to leave the house because she’s writing, and when I brought it up that I want us to do something, she just kind of brought the mood down while we were out since she clearly didn’t want to do anything but be at home writing. \n\nI adore her so much, and she’s an amazing partner but she won’t stop talking about her writing. She will ask me to read something or how she can work a scene better, or even questions about the characters since I’ve seen some of the show. And I feel so rude because she’s really passionate about it and is excited about writing, but it’s so much and it’s all she wants to talk about. She came home today and I tried to have a discussion about her grandparents being in town next weekend and how we should prepare (first time for me meeting them, so I’m nervous about it) and she kind of brushed it off and just switched the topic to her writing. \n\nHow do I nicely tell her I don’t care sometimes? I’m worried if I tell her she’s gonna be upset and not talk to me at all about it, which I don’t want her to feel like she can’t be open about her passions with me. \n\nTL;DR- my wife is obsessive about her writing, and it makes me irritated when she won’t stop talking about it. \n",

      "content": "Me and my girlfriend have been together for 4 years. Yesterday my gf wanted to post some pitcure of us on instagram, after an hour of constantly asking me about how she should edit every little detail, she did but then immidiately deleted it after i told her i think she should bring the saturation down a little. Then she just broke down in tears. I wasnt sure whats wrong because up to this moment we were having a great day and she was in a great mood too. Wouldnt tell me anything and then went to bed early. I felt like she's mad at me but decided not to press further to give her space. She talked to me normally but  like in a way thay made it seem that she'd rather be anywhere else or something. Today she comes home from work and even tho she is talking to me like nothing happened I can feel her hyper negative energy. She just tells me she's been feeling bad and that's it. Doesn't want to tell me the reason or anything. In the evening I finally asked her if she's mad at me or if I did something wrong because I don't understand what and I'd like to know. She tells me I got it all wrong and she's not mad at me at all but feels like I just don't believe her. I tell her it sure seems like she is and it's making me feel like shit because I have no clue what's going on and she's so negative I started feeling depressed. Then she goes on to tell me that her mom asked her if we had a fight a bunch of times because she didn't believe her that we didn't and how she's so annoyed her mom bothered her with those stupid questions. I tell her she asked because that's exactly what it looks like and that I'd really like her to communicate when she feels bad and to tell me why so I can be there for her or help in some way, but to not just create this hostile environment without explanation making everyone around her feel bad too because she's not feeling good. She just ignored that and it was like she didn't want to hear it. This happened in the past but I thought after some years and talking about it she learnt to communicate and regulate her emotions but I was clearly wrong. It just feels so immature to me and kinnda emotionally manipulative. I can't read her mind and I don't think everyone should feel horrible just because she's having a bad day (she was rude to her parents that day too). I always make sure to not make it everyone's problem when I'm sad or going through something and communicate with her how I feel. This is draining me so much and I don't know if I'm an asshole or not. \n\nTL;DR My girlfriend's refusal of communication about her emotions is emotionally draining me\n\n",

      "content": "I'm going to have my graduation ceremony two days from now. My sister is the most important person in my life, so I obviously want her there. But not her boyfriend. They have been together for about 1,5 years, and she has expressed to me on multiple occasions that she just doesn't feel the relationship and is considering breaking up. She actually already did one time but kind of got pressured into giving it another chance. Her boyfriend and their mutual friend persuaded her. The last time we saw each other, about two weeks ago, she seemed really sure she wanted to break up. Even more so because her boyfriend said stuff like \"There are scenarios in which it's okay to hit a woman, for example, if they cheat on you\". Then went on to tell my sister \"don't do anything bad to me if you don't want me to hurt you\".\n\nI immediately expressed that this feels like an unsafe situation and I begged her to end things for her own sake. They live together at her own place, so the guy would need to move out (he has somewhere to go). I get it, it's really not that simple to break up, especially if you live together.\n\nToday, she asked me what I thought of her bringing her boyfriend to my graduation. I've never met the guy, so this would be our first time meeting. I just don't understand. She's miserable in this relationship. She's been wanting to break up for a long time. According to her, she basically doesn't feel anything for him, they don't even really have good times together anymore and says they should've stayed broken up. And after his comments about hitting women, I don't understand why she's acting like that did not happen. Am I blind to this? Could something physical have happened and I'm just missing it? Is that why she's acting like everything's fine?\n\nI'm scared that if I tell her not to bring her boyfriend, then he is going to ask why he cannot come, and she'll confess that she'd told me stuff about him and I fear that he may escalate the situation into physical abuse.\n\nWhat I also don't understand is, if they're gonna break up, why bring him to a family member's event? Am I missing something here? Please help me navigate the situation. I don't wanna push her away by talking shit about her boyfriend. Even if she doesn't like him, I know this can be counterproductive.\n\nI also wanna say I don't wanna sound selfish. I understand the title is about me and my graduation, but let's forget about that, I'm actually more worried about her. It's alarming for me how miserable she feels in this relationship but stays in it anyway.\n\nTL;DR Sister wants to bring her boyfriend to my graduation but he said pro-abuse stuff. She's told me about wanting to break up multiple times but still decided to invite her bf\n\n\n",

      "content": "My gf and I have been dating for just over a year. It’s been a very loving relationship and things have been moving along great. She’s honestly fantastic: caring, funny, smart and a great communicator. The only issue has been intimacy. The sex isn’t bad, it’s more that it doesn’t happen enough.\n\nWhen we first started seeing each other it was pretty often. We slept together on the first date and almost every date for a few months. Eventually it slowly faded. I told her early on that I was a sexual person and she seemed more than happy about it. I don’t put much into love languages but mine is certainly physical touch with intimacy being a big part of a relationship to me.\n\nI brought it up 3 months ago that I wanted her to start initiating sex more often. I felt it only ever happened if I started it and I was doing the majority of the effort (I can count 2, maybe 3 times where she initiated). She was on board and was glad that I communicated my needs. But since then, we’ve had sex only twice. Partially due to me not initiating as much so she could. Im on 3 week business trip and i was turned down the night before I left. I feel like im going crazy. We’re both in our 20s, fit, and very intimate outside of sex. I’ve never had this little sex- no prior relationship came close and even when I was single i managed. It has me worried that if it’s so sparse now, it’ll be a completely dead bedroom down the road. I don’t think that’s a relationship I’d want to be in.\n\nAny advice on how to bring this up without sounding shallow? It’s honestly a conversation I’d never thought I’d have to have, especially at 25.\n\nEdit: Really important detail I left out: she started medication that affects her libido a few months back. Sex wasn’t often before this but has fallen off a cliff since. We had a few stints where sex was uncommon before, mostly during very stressful times in her life. \n\nTLDR: How do I bring up a dying bedroom without sounding desperate or shallow? ",

      "title": "I agreed to live with my gf (20F) of 6 months, but now she’s pushing for a $4K NYC apartment and I’m (21M), jobless, and overwhelmed",
      "content": "Before I graduated this May, my gf of 6 months who is an international student from China and I agreed to live together in NYC for her next school year. I agreed but said I'd need a full-time software engineering job first, and if I don't find one right away I'll part-time being a Server or something else to cover rent. She was excited and started apartment hunting right away and imagining our life together.\n\nNow it's June and she's back in China for the summer, and found a corner-view apartment for around 4.2k, which she said is a great deal. Her mom would cover her half of rent, and I'd cover mine, but I don't have a job yet, and no family support. I've been applying 50-100 jobs per day, with some interviews in progress. I told her I'd part-time if needed, but realistically that's hard to balance while improving my skills for job hunting.\n\nWhen I hesitated, she said the apartment she just found would be gone soon and wanted to immediately sign the lease. I told her I want to live with her but I'm sure... what if I get a job outside NYC? The tech market is bad for entry level rn and I'd take up any job offered. Signing now could mean paying rent without even living there. She got upset and sad I was only thinking of myself and not about where she'd live if we don't get this place. But she does have friends who are willing to live with her.\n\nShe said:\n\n“You say you’ve considered me, but your consideration is limited to what *you* think. That’s not really considering me — you’ve put me in a position where everything revolves around you.”\n\n“I feel like I’ve already compromised. My mom is covering the guarantor fee, and I’m helping you job hunt — but you still can’t make this decision. You’re not thinking about me enough.”\n\nShe then said we either sign now or she'll live with a friend and rethink our relationship. It it me hard. I realized: it feels like this relationship only survives if we're *not* long-distance and living together. She said if I truly cared, I'd just keep job searching until I find a role in NYC, and reject non-NYC roles. She even said on call, with her family on the background able to hear the convo, \"Never dating a poor guy again.\" I told her I'm not poor, my family just doesn't support paying for my rent if we already have a house here, and that I can do whatever I want once I get a job.\n\nI caved in and said I'd work part-time to cover rent while job hunting, and she'd help with apps. But I told her this means I can't afford to treat her to the lifestyle she likes (gifts, nice restaurants, etc) until I get a tech job, since the part-time job will only be enough to cover rent.\n\nI also proposed an alternative: she lives with her friend this year, I stay with my family in NYC, work part-time with fewer hours, and once I get an offer, I'll move-in nearby, renting a cheaper studio so we'd be very close. She said she's \"fine\" with it but said would still be very disappointed in this relationship, saying that I'm not prioritizing on solving the issue by just working more to live with her.\n\nI'll be doing what she wants, but honestly I feel really uneasy. Not just because of pressure, but beacause when things go wrong, she always makes it my fault. I'm starting to feel like I'm sacrificing my own career, stability, and self-worth just to hold things together.\n\nHow do I move forward with this without wrecking my career or completely losing myself... I've tried talking to her about this but I may be too narrow in my thinking to convey properly to her, how can I improve our current relationship situation?\n\nedit: The house got signed by someone else, and now she's blaming me for being too slow on making a choice that we \"already decided\" to go forward with. And now, she can't live in her ideal apartment, but I told her I'll help her search, and she said \"good luck finding one that is as good as this one, and just as cheap\".\n\nTL:DR - agreed on co-renting with rich gf but don't have a job yet and she's urging me to part-time to cover rent but I find that hard to balance with job hunting and interview prepping, so she mad.",

      "title": "MIL (60F) will not make a plan for her retirement, wife (29F) and I (31M) are afraid she expects to move in with us at some point.",
      "content": "Hello Reddit. I am looking for advice on how to handle this challenging situation. I will start with an overview of our situation and my MIL’s.\n\nMy wife (29F) and I (31M) have been together for 5.5 years and married for 2.5. We just relocated across the country for my job but are solidly in our DINK era right now and enjoying it! We are planning to buy a house within the next year and have kids within the next 2-3. \n\nMy wife grew up very very poor and in an equally dysfunctional family unit. Essentially my wife, her brother (31M), her mom / my MIL (60F), as well as her whole extended family (2 uncles and 3 cousins) all lived in the same house with her grandparents. It’s a 3 bed, 1 bath house and if you’ve seen the show shameless, that pretty much perfectly describes their past and current living situation. Her father has been completely absent from her life since she was a baby. My MIL has lived there on and off (mostly on) for over 20 years. Everyone mentioned above STILL lives there full time, with the exception of her grandpa, who passed, and my wife. Nobody, except grandma pays any bills or contributes in any meaningful way. They fight constantly and it’s just overall an extremely toxic situation. \n\nEveryone who lives there are very poor and is making no plans whatsoever for the future. Grandma owns the house but it is reverse-mortgaged and when she dies, the house will go back to the back. She is in her late 80’s and in good health considering her age, but she won’t live forever. Grandma is retired and living on social security, a pension and the reverse mortgage income. Everyone else there does work, but they are close to or slightly above minimum wage jobs. It is in a HCOL area. \n\nMy wife and I have talked to my MIL a few times in the last year about having a plan for her retirement and we are always met with a shoulder shrug. We have told her that nobody is coming to live with us, although my gut feeling is that she doesn’t really believe us? I am absolutely petrified that when grandma passes and the house goes back to the bank, my MIL (and possibly BIL) are going to show up on our doorstep and expect to live with us for free forever. Let me reiterate that no one in that house makes any plans for the future whatsoever! They have no assets and are essentially broke, so I am not really sure what the best plan is for them besides trying to get into low income housing (which we have suggested in the past, but she has made no moves to look at and apply for). \n\nMy wife does not want her mom to move in with us and I have told my wife that anyone in her family moving in with us is an instant dealbreaker that would end in divorce (I said this before we ever got engaged, and have reiterated my stance on the situation). \n\nI guess I am asking for any advice on how to navigate this situation, specifically if anyone has been in a similar situation before? Or just any advice on how to handle this and give her mom a wake up call that we won’t just take her and / or any other family members in at any point. Thank you! \n\nTL;DR: MIL refuses to plan anything for her future, we are afraid she will show up on our doorstep expecting to move in one day! \n",

How should I approach this? Should I just suck it up so he can enjoy playing games with friends since he hasn't been able in a long time? \n\nTL;DR: Husband wants to play a game with a female coworker and I feel sad about it. \n\n",

      "content": "I’m really confused about my feelings right now. I (20F) have known my boyfriend (21M) for two years, and we were really close friends for the last eight months. Less than a month ago, we got into a relationship (my first and his second).\n\nAt first it felt right. We got along so well, and he’s been nothing but sweet and supportive. But now that we’re actually together, I can’t shake this feeling that I might’ve said yes too soon. We had a fight before we started dating where he thought I didn’t like him romantically, and I was scared of losing him. I think I agreed to the relationship out of fear more than being fully ready or certain.\n\nHe’s doing so well. He says I motivate him, and he’s been pushing himself, improving, really doing great things. Meanwhile, I feel stuck. I’ve just been avoiding my own problems, not putting in effort, and I hate it. Not because he’s doing well, that’s amazing, but because I feel insecure in comparison. Like I’m not even good at the one thing he believed I was good at. I keep worrying that one day he’ll realize I’m not enough and leave me behind.\n\nI’ve noticed myself pulling away even though everything seems fine on the outside. He’s totally in love with me, honestly head over heels, and here I am questioning everything. I don’t even know if I’m really in love yet, or if I just didn’t want to lose him as a friend.\n\nTo top it off, my end semester exams are around the corner and I can’t even focus. Academics were the one area I used to feel confident in, and now I feel like I’m falling apart there too. I know I'm the problem here not him, I don't really feel like worrying him since he is busy.....\n\nI don’t know what to do or how to with all these feelings. Has anyone else felt like this after jumping into a relationship? Is this a normal feeling after being together for less than 3 weeks or a sign I need to step back?\n\nTL;DR:\nStarted dating my close friend (21M) 3 weeks ago. He’s amazing and clearly loves me, but I’m feeling unsure and distant. I might’ve said yes out of fear of losing him, not love. I feel stuck, insecure, and can’t focus on anything, including exams. Is this normal early relationship anxiety or a sign I rushed in?",

      "content": "I ( M23 ) had been seeing a girl ( F22 ) for three weeks. On this past saturday, I was showing someone pictures of her from her posts on instagram. Later that day, at 11 pm I went back to her instagram feed, and her posts were gone! They were posted under a section with an exclusive viewing list, so she had removed me from it.\n\nI didn’t really think much of it but today I went to hang out with her earlier and I casually brought it up. She instantly started denying that she’d removed me and kept denying it and said “i hadn’t even posted on my story, why would there be anything to hide.” I didn’t even mention stories. I didn’t even know that the exclusive list for posts was the same as the close friends list for stories. Then she opened her close friends list to show me that I was still on it. When she searched up my name, she very quickly tapped it to add me to it. I clearly saw this action and told her I wasn’t stupid. She continued insisting after that that she had never removed me. After that, I very neutrally said I had to go, I smiled, gave her a kiss and left. It is 10 pm and for an hour after I left she kept texting me random little unrelated details, as seen in the image I attached. This to me indicates guilt behavior, right?\n\nIs this a break-offable offense? What the hell is even going on here? Why lie so weirdly and obviously like that? I don’t care that she’s posting things she doesn’t want me to see necessarily, I’ve known her for not long. That’s not the issue, it’s the lying and denying and gaslighting that rubbed me really the wrong way. Keep in mind I don’t know her insanely well yet, I’ve only been seeing her for 3 weeks. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR, she lied to me incessantly about removing me from her story one night and I have no idea what she posted. Both that and the lying rubbed me very much the wrong way.\n\n",

While I was in the hospital (coma/ICU for 2 weeks, then recovery/rehab for 6 weeks) my mother kept my friends up to date with everything going on (OP walked 100 feet today! etc)\n\nMy friends and I (about 6 of us, male and female, ranging from 30-40) have been throwing each other birthday parties for the last 4 years. Sometimes house parties, sometimes dinner. Last year when one of our friends turned 40, we all spent literally thousands of dollars to go to St Martin for a week, complete with a private chef and a private boat/snorkeling tour.\n\nIf you do the math, you'll know my last milestone birthday was weeks after lockdown, so kind of a bust. The one before that was literally 2 weeks after my father died. For my birthday the last couple years they've thrown me a surprise party. Great and exciting the first year since I'd never had one, but last year I had made a reservation for all of us at a speakeasy I wanted to check out. Showed up at my friend's house in this amazing black velvet dress ready for a night out, only to find all my friends in jeans enjoying charcuterie. My gift last year was all of them donating money for me to go on a safari (about $250 total - amazing! but it never happened).\n\nThis year, my one friend A (35F) took charge in planning my birthday. I sent her a list of restaurants I was interested in, she asked if there was anything I wanted to do before or after dinner. I suggested maybe light snacks in the park and (again) a speakeasy after where our other, less central, friends could join us.\n\nGot all dressed up, showed up at my friend B's house (34F) and...\n\nJeans and charcuterie. No gifts.\n\nI don't want to sound ungrateful. I have great friends, but like... Do I not even rate a whole meal? I almost fucking died not even 6 months ago. It's a major birthday. \n\nI know things are tight for people financially right now - a couple of our friends are out of work - but B and her husband just got back from a month in Europe (after their last trip to Europe earlier this year).\n\nI just feel like... Idk. Disappointed? Hurt? These are all people I've tried to do thoughtful things for, I've been friends with all of them for at least 5 years - in fact, I'm the one who introduced them all to each other. Like they were all part of different friend groups and I brought them together.\n\nI just thought this year would be special.\n\nIdk if I should talk to them about it or if I'm just being a brat and should let it go.\n\nTLDR; Had a milestone birthday and a near death experience and my friends dropped the ball on my birthday party.",

      "content": "Damn it. Long story short - matched with a woman (28) from Hinge in March. We pretty quickly fell for each other. She's attractive, really funny, outgoing, is great at what she does. Early on she told me she has ADHD which was cool. I know plenty of people with ADHD and it hasn't ever been a problem. However, I had this realization that she tends to dominate conversations. Even worse, she tends to check out when it's my turn to speak or takes what I said and brings the conversation back to herself and continues to talk so quickly and for a long time. Sometimes it really does feel she's talking *at* me instead of *with* me. I'm a bit more chill and an introvert but I'm also pretty social so it's not like I need silence always.\n\nIt felt like it only happened a few times in the beginning because we weren't spending as much time together. I was also near the end of grad school and working a new exhausting bartending job so I thought I was genuinely just burnt and couldn't keep up with her conversation-wise. There was a day we went out into the city and I brought up something I told her probably two times before but she had absolutely no idea what I was talking about. I got frustrated and I just had to talk to her about it. She was defensive at first but broke down crying on a train and took accountability, which I thought was a good sign.\n\nThings seemed to get better and I see she's been working on it which is great but there's still been other times where the conversation becomes frustrating with her endlessly talking about herself and her stress/gossip/friends. I'm on vacation and I was telling her something personal before I left and all of a sudden she turned the convo on herself and began to cry over what she was talking about, which wasn't related to what I said really. So I got frustrated and kinda been ruminating on this throughout my vacation since I'm alone.\n\nIdk I really care about her but I feel a bit exhausted from her already and it's only been a little over 3 months. I'm feeling a bit silly about this because I used to be highly insecure and jumped into relationships I didn't realize were bad for me and stuck it out. My last relationship being in 2020-2021 in which I was miserable and it ended with me hurting the person. I've spent the last few years really working on myself and truly fell in love with being alone and single over being in a relationship that doesn't work. In other words, I've grown a whole lot over the last two years or so (finally amiright?). I've become more discerning of people and have ended things more responsibly so I really thought my current partner was right for me but I've become less enthusiastic over the last few weeks cause of our conversations and it sucks. I've been trying to be sympathetic to her ADHD but it does get exhausting.\n\nCould it all come down to lack of compatibility? I would love to feel more heard but not hurt her feelings or make it seem like she's shitty, what are some good ways to discuss this with her?\n\ntl;dr - new girlfriend's conversation habits due to adhd are already wearing on me I need help\n\n",

      "content": "Posting because I just had a fight with my mother and I don't know what to do next.\n\nTl;dr Overbearing mother overstayed her welcome, fought with husband, stressing my pregnant self out until I erupted and asked her to leave. Afraid my relationship with her is finsihed.\n\nI apologize in advance for the long post. I have a lot to get off my chest.\n\nSome background. \nI'm 29, married (2 years), and expecting my first child this fall. My mother, 60, lives in the next state over, still married to my dad, and this is her first grandchild. I'm convinced she's bipolar and she has insane mood swings just hours apart or a comment can set her off. She also lost her mom 2 years before she had me and has been telling me how she wants to be here for my pregnancy because she didn't have her mom during hers.\n\nAlso, about me, I am afraid of confrontation and I hate arguments. I always try to find a peaceful solution before any arguments happens so to avoid them. I am also struggling with prental depression. Also, my husband, 32, works nights.\n\nPre-stressor to Fight\nEver since I got married, my mom has been on to me about sending money to my husband for various things (mostly gas and groceries). I do earn more than him and while I do not earn enough for us to live on one income, I have enough left over after bills so I can afford to send him money. I still have my bank account linked to my mom's so she can see all my transactions and such. I know I need to get my own separate account but I'm afraid she will take offense and yell at me for \"not being financially responsible\". This whole thing has led her to think my husband is \"leeching off\" of me and is a \"lazy bum\", which is not true. He pays his share of bills and I only send him money if he absolutely needs it.\n\nThe Fight\nAbout a week ago, my parents showed up out of the blue, no warning, to our new apartment. They said they came to help us move in and get settled. My husband and I appreciated their help, but my husband was upset that they didn't give us a warning and just showed up unannounced. My dad ended up leaving after a few days but my mom said she was staying to finish laundry, cook meals, and such. After 3 days of just my mom, me, and my husband in the 2 bedroom apartment, there is tension. My mom is upset that my husband doesn't \"do any chores and sleeps all day\" (he works night shift so of course he has to sleep during the day). My husband hardly leaves our bedroom for fear of incurring her comments. I was stuck between them, having to listen to them complain about the other (more so of my mom complaining about my husband). \n\nTwo days ago, I came home from work and before I even walked in the door, my mom accosted me saying my husband failed to feed and take the dogs out before he left for a friend's birthday dinner and that he never did the dishes or anything. I told her I just got home and I have no idea about anything. I excused my self to take a shower, cried in the shower, then my husband came home. He assured me he did in fact take the dogs out and feed them, and he wasn't aware the dishwasher needed to be unloaded.\n\nI asked them both to come to the living room so I can talk to them together and proceed to tell them that they need to learn to get along because if it's like this for every birthday, holiday, etc, then I don't want this baby. My mom then starts yelling, saying it's all my husband's fault and that he's the one not listening and he's being lazy. At this point I run sobbing to my bedroom with my husband following me. She enters the room without knocking and tells my husband this is his fault and he's the reason I have prenatal depression (not true). I'm telling her to stop and I finally had enough and screamed at her to leave. My poor husband has been calm and trying to calm me down. She leaves the apartment to I have no idea where.\n\nThe next day I receive texts from my dad and paternal grandmother, apologizing for my mom and telling me to forgive her because she's only doing this for the best for me and that she has good intentions. My husband is telling me to give her some space and time and everything will work out.\n\nI feel that my relationship with my mom is closer to being severed which I don't want, but if she tells me to choose between my husband or her, I'm standing by my husband. I know my mom loves me but I'm afraid of how more complicated things will get when the baby arrives because this is my husband's child too. I don't know what to do next and I want to try talking to a therapist but I can't afford it at the moment with the baby coming. Any advice is appreciated.",

      "title": "My (35F) parents (70s) moved into my one-bedroom apartment and it is destroying my mental health.",
      "content": "I am a 35-year-old woman. I have had some successes in life. I have traveled a lot, I am pursuing a PhD, and I have worked across different sectors. But right now I am in a difficult place. I was laid off from my last full-time job and have been doing small contract gigs while applying for work and trying to finish my graduate program.\nI have not had a real break since 2015 and I am extremely burnt out. I am also single and currently living in a one-bedroom apartment that my dad leases for tax residency purposes. My parents usually live abroad but they let me stay here while I get back on my feet.\nIn March 2025, both of my parents moved into the apartment with me. They are in their 70s and have serious medical needs. I told them this would be hard for me, especially while I am trying to finish my PhD and apply for jobs. They said it would be temporary, but they have now been here for months, but will leave at the end of June. The apartment is under 400 square feet. It is not meant for three adults, two of whom have a lot of belongings and ongoing care needs. My mom constantly complains about the mess but does not acknowledge the sheer impracticality of the situation. She blames me for the clutter and accuses me of being lazy, selfish, and emotionally unavailable. Meanwhile, I am working on multiple small jobs, trying to write, and going through interviews. It feels like nothing I do is ever enough.\nMy parents have always been critical, but in the past few years it has intensified. They constantly bring up milestones I have not met. I am single. I do not own property. I have been financially unstable since 2024. They compare me to people my age who are married, have homes, or make more money. The message is that I have failed in life and that it is my fault. Lately the criticism has turned more aggressive, especially about my relationship status. I once turned down a few arranged marriage style set ups and my mom cried and brought up her cancer diagnosis as a way to try push me into the process of it. She was baffled I didn’t even want to meet that guy and essentially said it’s the only way forward for me. I date in my own a lot but I have not found my person and they used this to push me new narratives of inadequacy. They suggest that my being single is proof that something is deeply wrong with me, like I’m some kind of failed eugenics project.\n\nThis week I finally tried to say something. I calmly told my parents that their moving in has made it very difficult for me to function and that I have been extremely unhappy. My mom exploded. After our argument, she got on the phone with my cousin and said the following in Bengali:\n“I hope she does not get a husband, and even if she does, he will kick her out. She is sure to suffer in any relationship, even if there is love.” The phrasing in Bengali very clearly implied domestic violence. The way she said it, the \"kicking out\" was not figurative. She was saying I would deserve that kind of treatment. That even if someone loved me, I would make them hate me. That I was fundamentally defective, and something in me brings out the bad in otherwise good and loving people. \n\nLater, when I told her how hurtful this was, she acted like she had no idea what I was talking about. Then she got angry again and accused me of being arrogant and ungrateful. She said I had \"grown too big for my britches\" and that she would \"cut me down.\" She also \"joked\" about disinheriting me.\n\nI feel like I am going crazy. I cannot trust anything. I am constantly being hurt, then told I imagined it or deserved it. My mother will go from saying terrifying things to suddenly acting normal and asking what I want for dinner. The switch is so fast that it makes me doubt my own memory and perception.\n\nThere is something else I need to mention. When I was about 11 or 12, I had a journal I kept private. My mom asked to see it. I refused. I remember standing my ground. She looked at me and said:\n“I see how strong your no is. If you are ever taken advantage of, I will know on some level you consented.”\nThat memory has never left me. It was not a joke. It was not an offhand comment. I was a child setting a boundary, and she responded by threatening my sense of bodily autonomy and blaming me in advance for any potential future harm. I have spoken to my therapist about it and she suggested my mom might have Borderline Personality Disorder. But diagnosis aside, I feel lost. I do not know what to do anymore.\n\nI feel guilty. My parents are aging and unwell. They have supported me financially at times, including giving me this place to stay. But their behavior is affecting my mental health so much that I am beginning to shut down. I feel like I will never build a life for myself if I stay stuck in this dynamic.\n\nI am tired. I am ashamed. I feel worthless and angry and scared. I have no idea what to do next.\n\nMy questions:\nWhat are some realistic steps I can take to set boundaries when I do not control the housing situation?\nAm I overreacting or seeing this too emotionally? I honestly do not know anymore.\nHow do I protect myself emotionally while still trying to survive this phase of my life?\n\nTL;DR: I am a 35-year-old woman trying to finish a PhD and job hunt after a layoff. My aging parents moved into my small one-bedroom apartment despite my objections. My mom is emotionally and verbally abusive, telling relatives I deserve mistreatment and blaming me for being single and unsuccessful. I feel like I am going crazy from the gaslighting, cruelty, and lack of space. I need help figuring out how to set boundaries and survive this dynamic.\n",

      "content": "I (28f) and my boyfriend (29m) have been together for 8 years in August. I feel stuck and need advice. On mobile so apologies for formatting. Im upset too so I apologize if this is just nonsense rambling. \n\nI have always wanted to get married. (This is important for later) but backstory... \nThe first 5 years of our relationship was incredibly toxic. I had no family (my parents were physically and emotionally abusive, and turned my extended family against me) and fell quickly into a codependency with him. We fought constantly, said horrible things to each other, and were just nasty. At one point, he proposed to me, and I was overjoyed. I now believe he was doing that to get back at my family. We had lived with my mother at the time, and he did work on her house in exchange for payment for a truck. She lost her mind one night, kicked us out, and took it all back. I believe now that he proposed to try and get some sort of revenge on my mother, as he wanted to post it on Facebook and all that (which he never posts on there) and I was still friends with my father on FB at the time. A year later, he went from calling me his fiance to his girlfriend, and eventually pretended it never happened. Fast forward to now. Things have been better. We dont scream at each other anymore, talk things out, and take space when we need to if one of us (or both) gets too upset. As stated before, I have always wanted to get married. I know to many, it's just a piece of paper. But to me, it shows a commitment not only to someone, but a commitment from that someone else. Its 2 people saying \"hey, I want to tackle LIFE with you. All of it. The good the bad the ugly. We are a team and we are doing this together. I want to be bound to you!\" Admittedly, the past few years we were not super financially stable, and he said he wanted to wait until we were to consider it, which i understood. He told me a year ago he sees us getting married in a few years.  Now,  we are in a better spot, and he has been talking to me about starting a family and buying a house together, or renting one with space to grow a family. Today, he brought it up again, and I told him I would want to be married first. He laughed it off, and called me silly, and said \"oh you know that piece of paper is so important.\" I told him I was serious, it's very important to me, and I would want to be married. He said \"oh yeah, you and your catholic beliefs.\" I am not even catholic. I was taken aback, and didn't say anything until we got home. I brought it up again later, saying that it hurt me, and it is important to me, and I'm not even catholic. He apologized and said he was joking, and I told him it's not a joke to me, it's something I've always wanted, and it doesn't make me feel good that im expressing my feelings and hes making jokes. He apologized again, and i asked him if he ever sees us getting married, and he said he didn't know. I just told him it's very important to me, and I've made that known the entire 8 years we've been together, and he just said okay.  \n\nIt just feels like a slap in the face. I remember him making fun of his dad for waiting till him and his step mom were together for 9yrs to propose, saying how he shouldve done it 5 years sooner. Saying similar things about other couples. I dont know what to do or think. I love this man. We've gone through so much and grown so much together, and I feel like, why am I not good enough?? If it's truly just a piece of paper to him, why can't he just do it? I don't want to end this. But I don't know what to do. When I try and talk to him seriously, he just shuts down and apologizes or goes to bed. I just dont know what to do or what to say, or how to approach this without sounding like a jerk making an ultimatum. I guess I just needed to vent if anything and hope for advice. \n\n\nTLDR: my boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years, and he wants to buy a house and start a family, but doesn't want to marry me ",

      "content": "TL;DR 3 years post divorce, my boyfriend still gets regular updates about his cheating ex’s shenanigans. How do I tactfully voice my distaste?\n\nMy boyfriend Paul (31M) married his high school sweetheart Sophie (31F) when they were 24. \n\nAfter 4 years of marriage he found out she was cheating with a guy from the gym named Aaron (30sM), who was not only married himself to Christina (30sF) but also had 3 kids with her. Paul only learned about the affair because Christina found out, tracked him down on Instagram, and told him everything.\n\nBoth Paul and Christina decided to get divorces, and they ended up becoming quite close friends as they supported each other emotionally throughout the process. (Before anyone says anything, I’m 100% confident that their friendship has always been platonic. I’ve met her a couple times and she’s lovely.) \n\nNot long after Paul said f*** it, left his hometown, and moved halfway across the country. We met a little over a year later and have now been together for almost 2 years. Both super happy, marriage seems likely in the future.\n\nAaron and Sophie ended up moving in together after their affair was uncovered. Shockingly, they are still together. Not shockingly, their relationship is filled with all sorts of drama - cheating, fights that end with the police being called, you name it. \n\nHow do I know all of this? Because Christina, who is still stuck in their hometown trying to coparent with Aaron, has a front row seat to all of it. And she seemingly texts Paul with every single update.\n\nPaul usually fills me in on the gossip. If we’re together when he gets a text I might hear him snicker at his phone and say “guess what I just heard from Christina?” and if not he’ll probably tell me about it later that day. This is part of a pattern of him generally being extremely open and transparent with me which I do really appreciate.\n\nAt first it was kind of entertaining to hear about all the drama, and I tried to be understanding because at that point everything was still relatively fresh. But nearly 2 years into our relationship, I’m really getting sick of hearing about his ex all the time.\n\nI was also in a very long and serious relationship before I met Paul, but I haven’t kept tabs on my ex in years. No idea what state he lives in, if he’s married, has kids, whatever. And I truly don’t care. He’s not part of my life anymore.\n\nAs Paul and I start to talk more seriously about the future, I feel like I need to set a boundary. It’s almost like his ex has this presence in our lives. I don’t want to get married to someone who is still so invested in their previous marriage.\n\nHowever, I know Paul’s friendship with Christina is important to him and he knows he’s one of the few people she can talk to who really understands. And I don’t want to police his friendships.\n\nHelp? 🥴",

      "content": "Original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Rrnwj7gcmp\n\nHey everyone. I'm really greatful for all the advice and support I got on my original post. I posted another updates on the comments of the original.\n\nSummary, I (47M) have been with my boyfriend (35M) for a little under a year. He wants to get physical, and I haven't told him that I've never had sex, because of my history of abuse. After getting advice in the comments, I ended up writing him a letter explaining that I'm a virgin, and touching on some details of my abuse.\n\nI left the letter on the nightstand before I left for work. (My boyfriend works from home) when I got home, his daughter (2F) ran up to me for a hug like she always does. I scooped her up in a hug, and pretended to eat her little fingers.\n\nWe had dinner and put her to bed like usual, then my boyfriend asked me to sit on the couch. My stomach tied up in knots, and part of me just wanted to run out the front door.\n\nI have to admit, you were all right. He immediately held my hand and told me he's not disappointed at all. He asked me a bit about my past and the abuse I suffered from my mother. I don't feel comfortable going into detail here, but I barely scratched the surface and I ended up crying in his arms. I never want to be without those arms in my life. His hands rubbing my back, resting my head on his chest to listen to his heartbeat, the smell of his cologne. It's the safest I've ever felt in my entire life.\n\nOnce I calmed down, we started looking for therapists near me, then the night went on like normal. Watching our favorite shows while cuddling on the couch, doomscrolling social media and showing each other funny posts. Then we went to bed.\n\nI feel like a weight has lifted off my shoulders. I don't have to hide this about myself anymore. I don't have to live with the fear of my amazing boyfriend seeing me as a lesser man. I won't lie, I'm still anxious about not being able to satisfy him in bed, but we'll work on it together.\n\nI have a therapy appointment for later this month. So things are going good!\n\nTl;Dr, I wrote my boyfriend a letter, we talked, and now I'm gonna go to therapy.",

      "content": "Myself and my wife have had a lot of conflict in the past few years. She is a good and kind person, a great mother to our children, and does a lot for our family.\n\nA few years ago I sold some property and paid off our mortgage. I took six months off. This was elating for me. I don’t hate my job, as such, but I have always wanted options in my life (to work when I want to, see the world, etc).\n\nBut my wife wanted to upgrade our home. I tried to “sell” the idea of optionality (without a mortgage we have more choices - we could work more discretionally, she could yoga more, we could both spend more time with the kids). There were not specific goals, just a general idea that I was presenting. But this didn’t land and so I convinced myself to go along with it.\n\nIn anticipation of the increased financial burden I took a job - a stressful one, as it turns out. It is not guaranteed to succeed. I’m not too happy that I felt like I had to do this.\n\nMy wife works (she really is a contributor) and I indicated to her that if we did this it wouldn’t just cost us money but time. She needed to step up to make this work.\n\nNow we’re in the new place and we’re going backwards. I’m super stressed and my wife keeps saying that she’ll work more but it’s not materialising. Deep down I don’t want her to work more - but I (we) need her to. It’s just the reality that we signed up for.\n\nI find myself starting to resent her. I feel like she pushed this without fully understanding the repercussions. I look back at the life of relative freedom that we could have had and I am angry. The fact that I don’t see her living up to her end of the bargain has made me frustrated and we fight. If I try to bring up budgeting it gets very emotional and defensive.\n\nI need advice on finding a way to not put this on her and stop being so angered by it.\n\nTL/DR: my wife and I were free and clear, she pushed for a house upgrade, we’re going backwards now and I feel like she’s not pulling her weight. It’s making us fight.",

      "title": "I (31F) am thinking of breaking off my engagement to fiance (32M).",
      "content": "I (31F) am thinking of breaking off my engagement to fiance (32M). We had a whirlwind romance which could definitely be blamed for the fact that we got engaged the day of our 1 year anniversary (I told so many people “when you know, you know!” 🥴). It’s now 8 months later and I have completely hit a roadblock. He is fully aware of the internal struggle I’ve been having and I’ve given him several outs but he insists that we’ll work through it together (he’s so nice 😭). Leading up to the engagement I had a few freak outs about the commitment but when he actually proposed I felt like I was being silly about it given our compatibility and I happily said yes. We have lived together for almost a year now and he is the perfect roommate: cleans up after himself, cooks, contributes to chores. He is always doing acts of service for me which is rare in my experience (my exes weren’t total losers…just not as generous). We have the same life goals, worldview, and values. We love the same music, movies, and have the same humor. I am terrified I will never find someone as compatible as him. I feel like I hit the jackpot…on paper. But I just feel trapped and no matter what I do I can’t seem to overcome it. Our families and friends think we are crazy in love so I know this would come as a major shock to everyone. To complicate things neither of us has family nearby so I have no idea how I would handle moving out. We still have 6 months left on the lease and are both working pretty middle-of-the-road jobs (he’s in IT, I’m a teacher). \n\nAnd now to be a bad person. I sometimes look at him and can only see flaws. I think overall he’s handsome but I wasn’t instantly attracted to him. Sometimes I’m quite take by how cute he is and other times I scrutinize pictures to figure out if I'm really attracted. The sex is …meh. He is very timid about it and cannot seem to directly initiate even after several conversations about how I would like to feel desired (I initiate 75% of the time…the other 25% is him just looking at me and raising his eyebrows suggestively which is not a turn-on for me and I usually call it out). Once we start it’s fine and I do get off…but it’s the same exact thing every time. When I try to talk dirty he just stays silent even though outside of sex he says he loves it. We have had many conversations about it and he’s always excited to “spice things up” but then doesn’t put anything into action. He also struggles with ED and will not get help for it (I’ve suggested therapy so many times). I have been super patient about this and always redirect to making out to try and help him (he says distraction is best)- I’ve never shamed him. I just can’t imagine this being how our sex life STARTS in marriage. \n\nI have almost pulled the plug so many times. But I look at him and still feel so much love. And I laugh so hard with him- none of my previous partners have matched my banter in the same way. Watching him sleep just squeezes my heart and makes me want to protect him. I already know the comments will tear me up for “leading him on” or some variant and there won’t be anything worse than what I think about myself already. All I can say in my defense is that I’ve been entirely open with him about my feelings the entire time and he has chosen to stay on the chance that I’ll “get better.” I still feel like a terrible partner. I do take good care of him with lots of home-cooked meals, housework, surprise gifts and experiences. I took him on a surprise trip to Disney to celebrate a promotion just last month (ok that sounded stupid once I typed it out, but I am leaving it anyways…and he’s a big Disney fan while I’m a little meh so it wasn’t for me). I just don’t know what I can try anymore to get that loving feeling back. I want it to work so bad as it’s “perfect on paper” and I was sooooo in love (I know…honeymoon phase) but I feel myself checking out more and more every day. I have avoidant tendencies and lean way too hard into independence- I have been in therapy for months to work on this, but at this point it feels like it goes beyond that to some real issues. Any similar stories or advice welcome as I navigate the fork-in-the-road. How do I make the decision to end a relationship that seems so compatible? Can I revive it?\n\ntl;dr Whirlwind romance leads to engagement - now questioning everything.",

I’m not sure I feel that way anymore. The words look foreign, as if someone else had written them for me. I love him, I know that for sure, but it might not be a burning, passionate love. I think that it has evolved into a safe, secure, comfortable love. I'm not sure if I want that, but I also know it's far fetched to have passion forever in a relationship. I don’t think anyone could treat me as well as he does. \n\nBut, that could be the wrong way to think. When we first started dating, I loved the way he spoke and the way his mind worked. I loved how sweet and compassionate he was, I looked at him with adoration and intrigue. Although I do still love and cherish these things about him, I have found recently that they have fallen from the top of the list. Right now I think most about how he treats me. How he’s so sweet and understanding, so loving and kind and willing to do almost anything for me. \n\nSome concerning thoughts have crept their way into my mind like snakes, slipping through the underbrush unnoticed until they’re right in front of you. Do I love him or do I love the way he treats me? Am I in this relationship because I don’t think anyone could be as good to me as him? Is that a valid reason to be in a relationship? And, worst of all, could I do better? I usually brush it off as me being paranoid because I’ve gotten too comfortable. I can love him *and* the way he treats me, right? \n\nI have also been wondering about my sexuality in tandem with these thoughts. I have long known myself to be interested in women, having previously labelled myself as queer and bisexual, however I have not had many opportunities to explore that side of myself. I have never kissed a woman properly in a romantic context, I have never dated a woman, never had sex with a woman, gone on a real date with a woman… My concern is that if I choose to stay in this relationship for the long run, marriage and whatnot, will I regret not exploring that aspect of who I am? Twenty years from now, will I wake up in the middle of the night, plagued with regret over things I never got to do? \n\nI do love him. I love spending time with him, he understands me and I like to think I understand him and we get each other. I am happy being with him in the present moment, that is not the issue in the slightest. I think the future scares me. I think I’m scared of being trapped in a mediocre relationship stuck wondering about the things I could have done and the people I could have dated. It seems silly and shallow, but if I stay in this relationship for the rest of my life, will I feel okay having only had sex and properly been with two people? I have only been with one other man before him, and that relationship lasted about 7 months. \n\nI think deep within me there is this want to be wild and free and hot and carnally desired by every stranger I meet. I want to have crazy stories to tell one day to my kids or my nieces or whoever I feel should hear them. I want to be the coolest person I know. I am terrified of one day becoming mediocre and boring. Deep down I’m petrified, truly scared of being boring and limited by another person. I can’t limit myself to just being someone’s wife or mother. I cannot be seen as what I am to other people. I believe I might be a selfish person. I’m not sure what to do about that. I don’t know if that’s something I need to fix or feel ashamed of. I’m not sure what to do going forward. Has anyone else felt this way? What did you do about it? This is mostly just a rant post to organize my thoughts, but I need some outside perspective, if you have any to offer I appreciate it. \n\n  \nTL;DR: I (F20) love my boyfriend (M20), but I’m realizing my love has changed — it feels more safe and comfortable than passionate. I wonder if I love *him* or just how well he treats me. I’m also questioning my sexuality and worry that staying in this relationship forever means I’ll miss out on exploring that side of myself, and life in general. I fear becoming boring, trapped, or limited by commitment. Has anyone else felt this way, and what did you do?\n\n",

      "content": "TL;DR my bf’s ex is hateful and I don’t know how to handle the situation. \n\nMy bf (40M) and I (48F) have been dating for almost a year and we both have kids from our previous marriages. We have spent the past 6 months with each other’s kids getting comfortable, we’ve done long vacations together, been through some personal challenges, and stay the night together several times a week. We’ve been discussing moving in together in the next year as it seems like everyone gets along well and we have a really happy bond forming together already.\n\nHowever, his ex wife has been a real challenge to deal with. She talks badly about my bf in front of the kids, incites arguments and triangulates by involving their mutual friends and his family. She even went so far as to call CPS to make some bullshit report on him, resulting in their kids having to be interviewed by social services (investigation was closed with nothing to find). She has told the kids that we shouldn’t be moving in together because my bf “barely knows” me and my child. She refuses to call me by name, always referring to me as “that woman.” She definitely does not want to meet me or make nice. Mind you, I had nothing to do with their divorce and didn’t meet him until after they had separated so it’s not like she has a reason to hate or distrust me. She has also been dating someone for the same amount of time so it’s not like he is the only one “moving on.” The kids love me and my child and enjoy spending time with us. The ex just dislikes me simply because I’m the new girlfriend I guess.\n\nI’m assuming this must be a fairly common scenario so I’m curious as to how others may have navigated a relationship with someone who coparents with a spiteful ex spouse. I know at some point we are going to have to interact and based on her ongoing antics I’m pretty nervous about how she’s going to react to me in person. I’m also worried about her badmouthing me to the kids or even finding new ways to lash out at my bf going forward. And what if she’s hellbent on making us miserable or breaking us up and she manages to succeed? I am very  much in love with him but trying to be both cautious and practical as I don’t want the kids to be dragged into or impacted by this. Any advice?",

      "content": "My partner [25M] and I started dating right before the height of the pandemic, and with all of the social distancing our families never met for quite a while. After the social distancing rules lifted, we still didn’t end up planning anything right away. We finally moved in together last fall, and around that same time my MIL kept mentioning she wanted to bring the families together. She is a very social person, the type to host a fancy dinner just because without any need for a special occasion. My family is a lot more socially awkward and we tend to keep gatherings limited to social occasions or at least have there be a reason for getting together. \n\nOn our move-in day we had both families (my parents and his parents) come help out and that was when they met for the first time and spent the day together. We also had dinner later that evening and overall it was a nice day because my socially awkward parents were able to keep their hands busy but we still got everyone to meet. \n\nNow my MIL is saying it felt like a big rush and she wants to have a proper sit-down dinner with my parents and my siblings. I’m not sure what to say because she keeps moving the goalpost and increasing her expectations, but to be quite honest I have a very practical non-sentimental relationship with my siblings and they’re not the type to drive somewhere just to sit down to dinner with MY in-laws. For reference my brother didn’t come to my birthday because I live 50 minutes from him and he didn’t want to make the drive. My MIL lives over an hour from him and he DEFINITELY would not make that drive, or if he did he’d probably hate me for it. \n\nMy partner and I are planning to host an engagement or elopement party next summer, and at that point we’ll be bringing everyone together. \n\nHow do I temper expectations with my MIL around these sorts of social expectations? I don’t feel like getting into the weeds about my family dynamic but I guess I also owe her an explanation. \n\nTl;dr - My MIL wants to set up social gatherings with my family but I only see them on special occasions and I don’t have a super  close relationship with my siblings and I want to shut down this conversation.

      "title": "I’m (32M) frustrated with the lack of time and effort from my girlfriend (25F). It feels like any free time we have together is just a place holder, I don't feel like a priority in her life and more of a convenience. Is this going to be an issue?",
      "content": "I’m (32M) frustrated with the lack of time and effort from my girlfriend (25F). It feels like any free time we have together is just a place holder, until something else comes along, and it led to me not feeling like a priority in her life and more of a convenience.\n\nFor context, we’ve been dating for little over a year, and about 8 months ago I moved up to her location where she’s been living with her parents and stayed within her area (I lived in a camper van), until about 2 months ago, I then moved into an apartment. When the idea of an apartment came up with both agreed that she would eventually move in, we both signed a lease for a place that would reduce her commute from about 40 minutes to 10, picked furniture together...etc. She hasn’t “officially” moved in yet and her time at the apartment usually revolves around her work schedule and her other “obligations”.\n\n Now for the issues, it feels like every time she’s here at the apartment on one of her days off, something comes up that causes her to leave (usually something with her mom) and I’m lucky to get maybe half a day together. Despite us talking the night or days before about what we would like to do, whatever comes up takes precedence.\n\nThe latest example, she just got back from a 3-day trip (preparing for an upcoming diving trip) with her mom on Friday night, she then had Saturday, Sunday, and Wednesday free before she leaves for 12 days on this diving trip with her mom. I thought, cool, we’ll at least have some quality time to spend together. Well, Friday night she told me that she made brunch plans with one of her long-term friends for Saturday, so she would leave Saturday morning and wasn’t sure if she would come back or stay at her parents, she also told me that one of her distant friends mom passed away and the visitation was on Wednesday (terrible, obviously go to it), her mom also asked her to help finalize trip plans and for whatever reason required her to be at the her parents’ house.\n\nOn Saturday, she ended up back at the apartment late that night after having dinner at her parents, and mentioned that her parents were invited to a BBQ with family friends that they haven’t seen in like15 years on Sunday, but wasn’t sure if she wanted to go, so we talked about what we wanted to do Sunday and made plans, and again she brings up around noon on Sunday that she would like to go and she left around 4pm, returning at 1030pm, again understandable since it’s been so long and just unfortunate timing with everything else.\n\nI understand that this latest example is a bit extreme, but having all this free time pulled away before this long trip got me thinking about how much quality time we spend together, beyond just after work or the few hours before or after these other “obligations”.\n\nA majority of the things that pull her away are things involving her mom, like her mom needs help with something basic that she could accomplish herself, her mom signs her up to help with something that she has no interest in doing, or they haven’t seen each other in a few days so she has a sense of obligation to go spend 20 minutes at dinner with them after they get off work, then they all retreat to separate areas of the house, and all this is despite her telling me she wished she had enough time to just read a book in the apartment or spend more time together.\n\nSo I looked at my calendar and figured out it has been 75 days since we attempted a date night, because you guessed it her mom wanted help with something that day and 60 days since we actually accomplished that date night; we also decided 6+ months ago to do Alphabet dates and the date that happened 60 days ago was my turn to plan, so over the last 60 days, it has been her turn to plan the next date. I also realized that since moving into the apartment, she hasn’t spent a full day at the apartment without something taking up most of the day or her just being here in the morning or night and has only cooked one dinner since I moved into the apartment, because she’s just not here to do so or she’s working so I cook.\n\nWe’ve talked about these issues multiple times, I actively protest when these other plans come up, express disappoint, and I feel like she needs to set stronger boundaries with what she wants but has a difficult time doing so. She gets extremely overwhelmed, to the point that she breaks down crying because she feels like she can’t make everyone happy and completely ignores her own needs.\n\nWhile she was gone to the BBQ, I got worked up with all these thoughts and when she got back I  basically told her everything above, that I don’t think one date night over 75 days is sustainable. She replied with she’ll try to be better after she gets back from the trip, but I told her there is no trying, only doing. I know that we love each other and have talked about marriage and our future, but it sucks feeling like I’m just the fallback plan.\n\nSo in my mind, the main issue is my girlfriends inability to set boundaries with her mom, should I be concerned nothing will change? Can I approach this issue in a different way?\n\nTL;DR: Girlfriend and I haven’t had a date night in 60 days because any free time we have is overshadowed by other things in her life, despite her verbalizing that she wants to spend more time together.",

      "title": "What should I (18m) do about my subconscious distancing that has been happening with my parents (50s)?",
      "content": "\nMy parents have always been very supportive of me and went above and beyond in trying to make my life better and providing for me, which I always have and always will appreciate. I’ll never act like they neglect me or anything like that, because in that regard they’ve done a great job.\n\nHowever, ever since I was probably around 8 years old, I remember that I started to become secretive for some reason. I don’t remember any events that directly started it, i just began to distance myself from them for what felt like no reason. Whenever they asked me how my day was, I just said “good” and hoped to avoid any conversation after that. That habit has persisted to the present day, as I still don’t like talking about how my day went with them.\n\nAs I got older, they began to become much more strict about my schoolwork and grades, and with time the pressure became so huge I felt like there was always a cloud of just misery looming over me the entirety of the school year. By the time I was 13 I basically had depression for months straight at a time.\n\nI despised school and I despised how my parents saw it as basically the only important factor in my life and blamed me for any grade that wasn’t good enough even if I tried. I barely slept at night because it felt like the only time I was free from that train of thought, so I would just sit on my phone or let all my emotions out because I didn’t feel like I was even allowed to during the day.\n\nIn high school it all just got worse. They started to become overprotective with how I spend my time outside of school, not just be demanding in my academic performance. Like in middle school I was allowed to go anywhere and do anything with my friends, but now all of a sudden I’m probably doing bad things and they need to hover over me. School was getting harder and harder and so was their enforcement of trying to make me do good.\n\nThis past senior year was the low point. Every day I was miserable waking up knowing that they’re both home and I’ll have to listen to them fight and yell at each other all day. Knowing that every 5 minutes they’re gonna call me out of my room to yell at me about a scholarship or tell me that I’m not allowed to go somewhere with my friends because it’s “dangerous” or “I need to focus on school”. My grades were slipping because I had no energy or motivation and was completely depressed every single day.\n\nNow that the school year is over, I’ve been having a lot less problems with them, but they told me today how it feels like I avoid them and hide things from them and it feels like I don’t like them. It never even crossed my mind, but I see where they’re coming from. For the last ten years I’ve been like this. I never tell them how my day was. I never go up to them in public when I can instead just be around my friends. They say it feels like I ignore them. I’m not even mad at them, I had no conscious decision in avoiding them like that, but I have to admit I do it. Maybe it just comes down to how badly I want to be able to live in my own. How I hate seeing them EVERY SINGLE DAY no matter what, they’re always here, yelling at each other, blaming me for something, or making me feel like I can’t be myself when they’re in the same house as me for some reason. I just hide in my room and wait until they go to bed so I can be happy again. Why am I like this? What should I do?\n\nTL:DR- my parents are hurt by how it feels like I avoid them or ignore them, especially in public. I never really noticed how much I did it, but now I feel guilty, despite the fact that over the years I have had my problems with them and have naturally wanted more space. I feel like maybe I’m being unfair, and while it was only subconsciously that I wasn’t talking to them, I just feel wrong for it. I do care about them and appreciate them, but I’m just so tired of having to be basically attached at the hip with them especially with how the last few years have gone.",

      "content": "My girlfriend (25) and I (23) are in a serious relationship, we live together and have been very happy for the entirety of the time we’ve been together (about 1 months into living together and 1.5 years into being in a relationship). \n\nWe haven’t ever had any full arguments and have been almost entirely very content with each other. However last night she had a friend come stay as they had plans to go for some relaxed drinks at a pub/bar. She’d always had casual drinks planned when we talked about it through the week prior. Her friend lives about 1.5 hours away and usually spends the night if she comes here. I don’t usually like drinking but I found it weird as she usually asks if I want to come with but not this time. Her friend gets here at 7pm, they leave the house at around 9pm. \n\nI walk them up to the bar as it’s 5 minutes (important) from our house and I had to go into the grocery shop next door so I say goodbye to them both there. I go home and leave them to it without messaging because I don’t want to be a bother and my girlfriend texts at about 10:30pm saying they’re still at the same bar. We exchange a couple of texts and I fall asleep with her last text to me being at 12:45am. I wake up randomly at about 2:30am and due to injury couldn’t get back to sleep so I go on my phone for a while as she’s still not in. I hear them come in at about 3:15am (most pubs here close at 11/12am generally with 1am being the latest). They stay downstairs for a while talking and my girlfriend comes up after a while and sleeps as far away as possible, I can tell it takes her a while to fall asleep which is uncharacteristic. Also uncharacteristic as she usually has to cuddle me for her to fall asleep. In the morning, she makes no mention of where she went and so I don’t ask any questions. I am familiar with the pub she went to and it is fairly upmarket and wouldn’t have doors open past 1am latest from what I know if there’s no events on. \n\nThe next day I don’t mention anything and that night she says randomly “we just stayed at the pub all night”. I ask her what time she got home as she doesn’t know I was awake at the time and she says “probably just before 1, the bar was still open”. I go into an anger freeze and don’t know how to respond so bottled up a lot of rage and hurt and just went straight to bed. \n\nI don’t know if I’m overreacting, we’ve never had any issues with trust before and I really don’t want to start having to doubt her. I fully understand that being unable to confront her is counterproductive, I am extremely conflict shy and internalise pretty much everything as I still find conflict incredibly scary due to past experiences (not with her). I don’t know how to go about this or how to approach this situation as I do actually want to just see the end of it, I don’t like feeling like I can’t talk to her so I just need a push on how to discuss this with her without sounding accusatory or harsh as I would hate to tarnish the gentle relationship we have. Any help would be appreciated\n\nTL;DR my girlfriend lives with me and went out with her friend for casual drinks at a pub, she got home at 3am (I know as I was awake and heard them) and told me the next day that she got home at 1am. Pubs here close at 1am and she’d said that she had stayed at the pub the whole night. I haven’t confronted her yet as I don’t know how to. ",

      "content": "Me (29F) and my BF (29M) have been together for 3 years and moved in together 6 months ago. Since I have known my BF I have noticed that his mother if very overbearing. She texts hims daily and gets upset/worried if he does not respond. When I met her I thought she was a very kind woman and thought she approved of me. My boyfriend and I have gone over to her home for holidays and birthdays. Recently, however, I overheard her talking with my boyfriend on the phone in tears stating that :\n\n\\-she feels like I am driving a wedge between her and her son\n\n\\-she is wondering if my bf feels the need to choose me vs her\n\n\\-she doesn't feel like his love for me is reciprocated\n\n\\-she thought that when my bf would get into a relationship it would add to the family and not take away from her family\n\n\\-one time she made a comment when I was at her house about my bf being a momma's boy and apparently I had a \"look\" on my face that she \"will never forget\" (LOL, I don't remember that but okay)\n\nI have never prevented my boyfriend from spending time with her at all. I don't think she has an issue with me personally as I feel like no matter what woman came into her son's life she would react this way.

When he was talking with her on the phone he didn't say much as he didn't want to make the situation worse and stated that she won't change anyway.\n\nI was wondering how other's would react to this and if anyone has any advice?\n\n  \nTL;DR: My boyfriend's mom feels like I'm stealing her son away even though I never prevent my bf from seeing her or spending time with his family",

      "title": "My bf is too caring???",
      "content": "My bf (21M) and I (22F) have been together for 6 years. For the first 4 years of our relationship, he suffered from clinical depression. Once I helped him move out of his parents’ house and we moved into our first apartment together, his mental health began to improve. He struggled a lot at first (breakdowns, anxiety, etc.) but slowly was able to grow into a healthier person. We have struggled a lot in our relationship over the past two years. Not only did we move to a new state on our own just months after moving in together, but we both dealt with our own family and personal struggles. \n\nI’ve developed some depression of my own lately. I’ve struggled with anxiety my whole life as a result of my childhood experiences and feel as though I’m grieving my family and childhood (I know bf went through a similar thing recently as well). I admit that I have felt exhausted, dissociated, and had a bit of a hardened heart for a few months. Bf is incredibly caring and wants what’s best for me. He asks constantly what’s wrong, how I’m feeling, and implores me to open up and show my “true colors,” whatever that may be. This great, but it is CONSTANT. I feel like all we do anymore is talk about feelings, mental health, and our spiritual lives. It is around 4+ hours every day. This is after I have gotten off work and just want to relax and wind down. Bf says we shouldn’t just self-soothe and should instead work through the problem. We will be up until 2-3 in the morning doing this and then I have to get up at 8 for work. I am not really sleeping.\n\nWhen I try to bring this up with him, he gets upset that I don’t want to open up to him (I do, I’m just exhausted) and doubles down. Saying that “that proves I need to talk.” My exhausted brain then spirals into anxiety and we end up having an intense conversation before I end up having a complete breakdown. This happens maybe once a week. I love that he cares, I know he is only trying to help me, but I am so tired. I don’t know what to do.\n\nTLDR: My bf constantly wants to talk about feeling and open up to each other, but I just want to relax and wind down instead of having an intense conversation every night. \n",

      "content": "  I (32M) have been dating a lady we will call Alexus (35F) for about 2 months. Around November of last year, I started planning a solo trip for my next birthday. I ended a relationship last year and I realized that the past 2+ years had been pretty traumatic - losing 3 close family members, including my dad. Because I have been in nursing school *and* working full time, I feel like I have been going nonstop. So I decided to plan this trip as a way to be kind to myself, take a break from the obligations I have for others, and prioritize my own feelings and  to focus solely on the things that I want to explore. \n\nIn April, I met Alexus. Things have been going very well between us. We are both self sufficient adults who have traveled abroad for leisure multiple times. We are kind to each other and communicate well 95% of the time. However, we just can not seem to reach an agreement regarding the trip I planned. \n\nAlexus feels as though she is being excluded. She says that things have been going well between us and she would have expected me to invite her. She also says that because it is my birthday, it stings a bit more. She says that it feels like I am only considering my own feelings and that it isn't a good foundation for a relationship. \n\nThe other important part is that she does have some trauma related to past relationships when it comes to a partner traveling solo and cheating/lying, etc.\n\nOn the other hand, I recognize and even understand her disappointment. But, I do think it is well within my right to proceed with the plans I have had for several months - mostly because inviting Alexus would completely negate the purpose of the trip. She suggested - and I considered - inviting her on this trip and planning something smaller for my own getaway. But, that is the perfect illustration of why I need to take this trip to begin with. I ALWAYS end up sacrificing the things that I want in order to appease family, friends, and/or significant others. \n\nDoes this seem like an appropriate request from Alexus? And if not, how can I make it clear that this solo trip is about doing something for me and not excluding her? I am very interested in continuing to date her. I also want to be sure that I am considerate of  her trauma with the way I articulate my feelings. \n\nTL;DR: I have plans to travel abroad solo for my birthday. I have been dating a girl for \\~2 months. She feels it is unfair that I haven't/wouldn't alter the trip to include her in my plans.\n\nThanks All.\n\nEDIT: Just for additional context, I did change the destination of my trip AFTER we met. I’m not sure if this changes anything.",

He has an English degree, reads a lot of literature, and is very creative in terms of storytelling and I truly believe he can write a good novel. \n\nThe problem is, he’s overlooking good career opportunities in lieu of pursuing writing full time  when he’s only maybe halfway through the first phase of writing his book. Right now he’s a tech field agent and makes decent money (like 50k annually) but he also says often that he hates his job. His job offers a paid training program where he could learn more advanced technology stuff (I don’t understand tech so I can’t explain it better), but he says he doesn’t want to do it because writing is his dream, not doing I.T. \n\nHe says that all the time he would spend on learning the new systems, which takes about a year, is time he could spend writing his novel. He says “let’s just wait until I write and publish this book, maybe it will do really well and I can finally quit my job and write full time!” But I don’t know if he knows that writing a book can take years to publish, and even then making decent money right off the bat is nearly impossible. \n\nWe don’t want kids, but we do want to buy a house in the next few years and enjoy a comfortable life. Right now we live in low income apartments and we do alright, but can’t afford all the things we wish we could. I just can’t help but feel like he’s setting himself and our future back by not taking the opportunity to make a better living in the mean time. I absolutely want to support his dreams and I want him to write, but also if he has the capability to move up in a field that pays well, I have a hard time seeing why he wouldn’t want to do that now and put writing to the side a bit until we’re financially more comfortable. \n\nHow do I talk to him about this without crushing his dreams? Or am I being an asshole for thinking he should consider a job he doesn’t love over his passion? \n\nTLDR; boyfriend wants to make writing his career instead of taking a stable tech job, and I’m conflicted about it ",

      "content": "My brother and I both lived away from the city we grew up in when we were in our early 20s.  I was working out of state and he was in the military.\n\nWhen I moved back home in 2018 I bought a condo.  He was living on his own with some assistance from our parents while he was going to school using his GI bill after he got out of the military.\n\nSince I had an extra room in my condo I told him he could live with me and pay a pretty low rent.  We're in a high COL area and I don't ask him for much.  He just pays me every month and I take care of my mortgage, all our utilities, internet, etc. What he's paying is roughly half of what it would cost him to live on his own with a regular roomate somewhere in our city.  It's nice to have some extra money towards the mortgage and at first it was cool to help him out while he was finishing school.\n\nWell, he got his degree in 2020, and had talked about grad school.  5 years later he's still not in school and still hasn't had a job since he got out of the military almost ten years ago.  I'm pretty sure he's depressed and I know he has some health issues.  He's a combat vet and is deaf in one ear.  He also has some kind of diet restrictions.  He won't really give anyone any details but I know his stomach and throat bother him.  He gets some kind of disability from his time in service I'm pretty sure.  Again he doesn't really tell anyone.\n\nWhen I ask him why he hasn't started looking for a job it's \"health issues\".  The thing is he still goes out with friends sometimes, does his own grocery shopping, goes to the gym almost daily,  and other active things. \n\nIt's not about the money, I do fine financially and I've always been happy to help him out..but this was never supposed to be a permanent situation.  It's frustrating that he's almost ALWAYS home.  He also keeps weird hours and is up ALL night every night and sleeps in the day.  Makes it extra annoying since I work all day while he sleeps..then he's up when I'm home for the evening.  I work really hard and never have my condo to myself and when friends and family ask what my brother is doing I really don't know what to say anymore..he's in his mid 30's now and I really don't have an answer.  I've told him several times over the last year that he needs to start looking for work..it's going to look worse and worse to employers that he just has this massive unemployment gap, it's not healthy, etc. \n\nI've brought it up to my parents but they're getting older and I really don't want to make this their problem.  I know they're worried about him.  A couple months ago I even spent a day making a resume for him and showing him some local jobs he might like.  Even told him a friend is a supervisor at Costco and if he just wants SOMETHING to do for now I could put in a word for him.\n\nWhen I tell him he really needs to get a job and get busy in life he's basically saying \"Why do you care?\".\n\nI don't know if I need to tell him to get a job or move out..or if I'm overreacting here.  Is there something else I could do to help?\n\nTL;DR Brother is in his mid 30s and living with me.  He contributes somewhat but I'm afraid I'm enabling him to just be content doing nothing.  Driving me a bit crazy that I never have my own place to myself and running out of answers when friends and family ask what he's doing with his life.",

      "content": "I (23F) have been with my boyfriend (24M) for about a year, and I need help understanding a critical difference between us. To make a long story short, my boyfriend has a really bad habit of overcomplicating things. I think this stems from a sense of perfectionism, but it's exhausting because it makes simple tasks extremely time consuming and, because it's so time consuming, he often procrastinates and doesn't do the things he's supposed to. \n\nFor instance, he won't make/eat breakfast unless I'm with him because it takes too long (he claims it would take him an hour to make a smoothie and I'm just like...how on fucking earth does it take you an hour to make a smoothie?) and the thing is, I've seen him in action. Cooking even the most basic meal takes 3+ hours because of the all the crazy detail he puts into it (and, for the record, it always tastes like a normal meal -- he's a good cook, but the stuff he's making does not require the time he's putting into it). \n\nI don't want to critique him on this, because it seems like it's an aspect of his personality, but it's staring to get really frustrating. When I try to help or offer suggestions for how to simplify things, he just brushes them off. This is fine, but I can see how discouraged he gets and how he will go into freeze mode and just not do anything because of how overwhelmed he is by how intensive something is going to be. But he's the one making it that way? Am I making any sense? This applies across all areas of his life except, as far as I can tell, his work. \n\nI'm also frustrated because this ends up impacting the time we spend together. Sometimes (maybe half the time) I'll come over because we've made plans and it will take him HOURS to clean up around the house, take a shower, etc before we can leave. I end up helping him, which is fine, but I'm always like...hello? We went on a roadtrip together for the first time (just a quick 3 hour drive to his parents cabin in the mountains) and the drive ended up taking almost 6 hours because we had to stop every 20-30 minutes for one reason or another. I didn't get visibly frustrated, but I was so baffled and annoyed. I worry that this feeling will build up more over time and turn into something uglier. \n\nI truly do love my boyfriend so much. He is such a tender-hearted, caring person, and the other \"issues\" we've run into, if you can even call them that, have been so minor. We're both easygoing, but I'm definitely the ones who's more organized/on top of things/quick. But are we just not compatible? What conversation would you suggest having with him? Am I actually just too \"high strung\" to cope with his slower pace of living life? Is this possibly a mental health thing? \n\nTLDR: My (23F) boyfriend (24M) overcomplicates things to a frustrating degree and it's driving a rift between us, at least for me. Not sure how to approach it as I've never seen anyone else act like this. ",

      "content": "My husband has been very controlling about what I wear. It’s gotten so much worse over the years. We have been married 13 years. The more I give into his demands the more the bar raises and I can never seem to make him happy. For example: I wore leggings and a tank top everywhere. We have 4 kids, I’m an active mom. I go to the gym and work out in the garden. He made a comment one day about how it was skin tight and why does everything I wear have to be vacuum sealed on? I added a sweatshirt around my waist then started wearing oversized Tshirts. Any shorts I wear no matter how long are criticized. I’m down to just wearing pants and big Tshirts everywhere. He claims he can’t stand women who flaunt their bodies and it’s gross to him. He likes modest women. I obviously want to attract him, so I give into his demands. He also does not like if I wear make up when I leave the house if he isn’t with me because “it’s not for him” or I’m “trying to get attention from others”.\n\nWell, yesterday I found out he has been scrolling on FB watching thirst trap videos. What I’m most annoyed about is him lying that he doesn’t like women like that and makes sure to dim me down so nobody can find me attractive, but actively looks at other women regularly. He lied to my face and gaslit me until I found solid evidence of the video history. For the record, we share a burner FB account we use for market place. Neither of us are into social media at all, other than Reddit. I just noticed his Reddit app was deleted. I might have to dig into that. Anyway, I need advice for what to say to him to make him understand he can’t control me anymore, that I don’t dress for others?\n\nTl;dr: my husband is controlling of me and what I wear because he says he hates provocative women but looks at women online that wear skimpy outfits/bikinis. I don’t know where to go from here.\n\n***UPDATE: he is now ignoring me and giving me the silent treatment after I went off on him and told him I’m no longer conforming to his clothing standards and will wear what I want. This is what he does. He messes up or hurts me, I get upset, he ignores me until I come crawling to him because he knows I crave love and affection. He uses the reverse psychology on me. How can he know he messed up and then turn it around on me? This time it disgusts me. \n\nAmong all our other issues he refuses to cook or help with the cooking load. He once told me “I’ll do all the laundry if you just shut the fuck up about cooking”. He has yet to do all the laundry. We share a business and work together. Our schedule is very laid back. We have the summer off. There is no reason he can’t help with cooking sometimes for our family or even order something. I mowed our lawn and came in around 7. We usually eat around 5. He had cooked himself scrambled eggs and left our 3 kids to fend for themselves. He did make our youngest (8) chicken nuggets. But seriously?! He can cook for himself but not make sure everyone is eating? I would never just cook something for myself without making food for the kids. They said he offered them eggs, but he knows they don’t like eggs. Anyway, this is just another ick and I’m really over it. Yes, I feel rejected. But I deserve better. ",

      "title": "Roommate situation got weird, do I still move in?",
      "content": "hi, i’m looking for some perspective on a roommate/friendship situation that’s gotten complicated.\n\ni (21f) was planning to move in with two close friends next fall. we’ve all known each other for 3+ years and had even toured apartments together, made spreadsheets, and were generally excited to live together. things felt okay until recently.\n\nshe and i have always had kind of a dynamic i can't explain. she’s known as the “mom friend”, and she is very responsible,  academically driven, and she has a poised, slightly guarded personality. it’s not that she’s mean, but over time i've started noticing subtle things that made me feel kind of judged or small around her (comments about academics, lifestyle, etc.) she’s will make slight comments that feel a little off, but she says them in such a neutral way that i question if i'm just being sensitive. she enjoys gossiping about other people's status and lifestyle and grades and such. \n\nsometimes she’s very formal, warm, or talkative in group settings, but when we’re alone, she’s distant and kind of dry, like we are acquaintance. she laughs at jokes before the punchline, reacts unusually early to memes i show, and i often found myself carrying conversations or even sometimes asking questions i already know the answer to just to get her to talk. she never really asks about me or initiates unless it’s something she's personally interested in. she's also a bit dry and cold to my boyfriend. but again, its nothing outright cruel. but it got to the point where for example, i'd hear someone in the kitchen and run out excited to show my other friend something, notice it was her, and instinctively revert to pretending to wash my hands and going back into my room. it's because sometimes i don't even know what to say, and end up saying stuff like \"but anyways,\", \"yeahhh, so\", \"anyways then...\"\n\nthe tension kind of progressed recently when she made a comment in front of me and another person (a negative comment about someone else who we don't know) that felt like a dig, and i asked her why she feels the need to discuss people that she doesn't know all of the time. i didn't yell or have a tone but i was just kind of barely holding back my annoyance. and instead of responding, she completely shut down, was silent for a minute and then redirected her attention away from me to the other girl in the convo like nothing happened. she didn't apologize, clarify, or even defend herself. since then, we haven’t spoken directly at all. as soon as the other girl left the room she texted me asking if i was okay, and then a few days later she moved home before us. the girl and i ended up alone for 8 days, and she ignored me the entire time, would slip back into her room when i came out of mine, and avoided common areas in ways she hasn't before. when we were moving out of our apartment, she didn’t say hi or bye while her parents were there, but was lovely to my mom and unusually polite to my boyfriend. she only texted after i’d left the building, to say something logistical (did you check out yet). she left without saying bye knowing she will be gone for 1.5 years. \n\nand since then, she’s still been texting in our group chat as normal, things like “you guys got this ❤️” before a test, \"miss ya'll/ love ya'll\" and stuff. but we haven’t resolved anything, or spoken.\n\nthe thing is, i have already made a mental backup plan for my living arrangements. if i do decide on this, the only thing left is telling my other friend in the group i’m not moving in anymore, and i feel horrible about it because she hasn’t done anything wrong and i actually enjoy living with her. i just don’t know how to bring this up without it being a whole thing. and also, i keep wondering if im just reading into it or being overly sensitive. is this even worth ending a whole living situation over? its been a plan in progress for years. \n\ni guess what i want advice on is: does this sound like a legit reason to not want to live with someone? if so, how should i explain everything to my other friend? and is there a way to do this that minimizes the drama, or is that unavoidable? any advice would be appreciated.\n\n**tl;dr:** had a tense dynamic with a friend for a while (dry convos, judgmental comments, one sided energy). called her out about something, and she completely iced me out with no defense or convo, just silence. now she’s acting like nothing happened in the group chat, hasn't reached out individually, and we were supposed to lease together next year. not sure if its worth backing out or not.

      "title": "Should I Stay or Go",
      "content": "I (25F) and my husband (26M) have been together for about 8 years. We’ve had a lot of issues in the past.\n\nI was a sahm for a year and the money from selling our house was supposed to cover anything I would have provided. He was in charge of finances. I always asked how much money we had and was always told “We’re good.” And never given a straight answer. When I pried, it always turned into a huge fight and he would name call and become enraged so it was always dropped. Well, when we moved, I found out on the drive over while trying to find a rental online, that we only had like $1k left (not enough to cover 1/3 of the cost to move in somewhere) and he had racked up $6k on my credit card without telling me he even used it (after I had just paid it down).\n\nI do not trust him with finances and never want to put myself in a position where I have to rely on him for anything again. He is totally irresponsible and won’t tell me if something is wrong. He’s also irresponsible around the house.\n\nI do the majority of the housework. He doesn’t take the garbage out. He changes maybe a couple of our three kids’ diapers a week. He hardly cooks. He doesn’t do the dishes or laundry. Even I mow the lawn most of the time. It’s like I have a fourth kid.\n\nOn top of it all, he has a video game addiction and refuses to do any activities in the weekend or even go outside for longer than maybe an hour tops. He just never wants to do anything but play his games. When he does play his games, he yells profanities for the kids to hear and if anyone walks in front of the tv, he has a meltdown. He also ignores any mischief the kids get into while playing so if I leave him alone with them (yes, he is informed that I’m leaving the house), when I come back, the kids have gotten into things they can’t have and made huge messes- he’s totally oblivious.\n\nHe’s often in some awful mood too where everything I say makes him angry. He uses language he shouldn’t toward the kids and I and always tries to play the victim when confronted “well, you didn’t listen to me.”, “well, you know I’m trying to do something”, etc. he doesn’t take responsibility unless I spend a good amount of time convincing him what he said was rude and hurtful.\n\nIntimacy is also bad. He doesn’t like me cuddling with him, leaning against him, anything like that. He says he’s always sore so it hurts him? But he does always expect and wants sex and acts like I’m being an awful, neglectful wife when we don’t have sex often.\n\nWe have talked about all these things many times. Nothing ever changes on his part. I’ve had a lot of mental struggles in the past and worked on myself. I’ve quit my addictions, I’ve addressed my OCD and gotten treatment for it, as well as other things. He doesn’t ever seem to change. He spends money the second he gets it, he talks how he wants, he plays his games all weekend most weeks, and he hardly does anything around the house.\n\nWell, I thought I knew what I was doing (leaving) but out of the blue, he started being helpful and kind about a week and a half ago. He started tidying up the house unprompted and actually going on family outings with us without moping and complaining about it for hours first.\n\nTL;DR He’s been the way he is for years and years and has never changed his ways. Should I be hopeful because of how he’s been behaving the past couple of weeks or should I just continue with the plans I already had to leave? I do have three kids as well and rely on my husband’s parents three days a week for childcare. I don’t think he would tell them to stop watching the kids on my days, but who knows- divorce brings out bad things in people. I do love him deeply platonically but feel totally disrespected and used by him. Can we ever have a peaceful relationship? Is there hope? Or should I continue my plans?",

One of my friends parents told them about it and it's been extremely obvious.\n\nI hang out with her all the time and other then a snippy comment once in a while they let it slide.

I've been dating a girl for many years now and I'm sure they're aware we just never talk about it and I'd like to get rid of this dynamic.",

      "title": "How to deal with the fact that my (30f) boyfriend (35m) of nearly 5 years still doesn't want to live together?",
      "content": "Hi everyone. \n\nI've been with my boyfriend for nearly 5 years. He has always had longer timelines for relationship milestones than me, but I've been patient with him on things like becoming \"official\" or meeting his family. However, I just had my 30th birthday and things are starting to change for me when I think about my future. \n\nI always told my boyfriend that I wasn't in a rush to live together, but that I would definitely want to in my 30's. Neither of us has ever lived with a partner before, so this is completely new territory for both of us. I have expressed to him several times over the last year that I'm feeling ready to try living together, that it would make more sense logistically and financially for both of us, and that I feel it is a necessary step to take before even considering having children. As a woman of 30, the kids issue feels more pressing than it has before. \n\n  \nThere are a few important facts about our situation:\n\n  \n1. For the last year, a major construction site has been active beside my apartment. The site literally shares the wall with my bedroom and has made the house nearly unlivable. Constant noise from 7am-6 pm or even later, every weekday, sometimes reaching 100 decibels and beyond. The site has caused damage to the building and to the apartment in the form of broken pipes, cracked walls, mold and mildew, etc. I work from home most days of the week and the situation has had an extremely negative effect on my mental health, stress levels and work life. My boyfriend has offered to let me come to his place whenever I need to, but won't consider moving in together now as a long term solution. \n\n  \n2. My boyfriend purchased an apartment 6 months ago. He made this decision unilaterally. Though he did ask for my opinion about some things during his apartment search, he never even considered renting a place together, or buying a place big enough for both of us to live in. I was very hurt and upset by him making such a permanent decision, seemingly without including our relationship as a priority. He claims he always expected me to move into this apartment at some point, but won't give any sort of timeline or concrete ideas as to when. I also fear that if I did move in, it would be me living in his space, never us sharing our space. \n\n  \n3. We live in a country where rent and the cost of living is completely out of sync with salaries. It is by far the most expensive country on the continent. I work full time, but still cannot afford to move into another apartment of decent quality. If I moved now to escape the construction site, I'd have to either sacrifice space/ quality or move to a less safe neighborhood. I am currently searching for apartments, but leases here are generally 2 years, so moving to a new place would also prolong our eventual (perhaps hypothetical) cohabitation as well. \n\n  \n4. When we spend time together, 95%+ of the time, I go to his place. It has been this way since the beginning of our relationship. After nearly 5 years, it is annoying to have to pay bus fare/ taxi, plan outfits and what I need to bring ahead of time constantly, physically carry all my stuff back and forth, and then not have access to my foods and my things when I'm at his place. He has come to my place occasionally, but hasn't slept over a single time since the construction started. He also claims he can't work at my house because he needs to work on his desktop rather than laptop, so he's never stayed for more than a night when he has stayed. \n\n  \nWe have a really lovely relationship, we get along well and have a lot of fun together. We are very supportive of the others' careers and endeavors and never run out of things to talk about. But I just don't know how to move forward with this situation. I feel rejected in a way. I would hope my partner of 5 years would be thrilled and excited at the idea of living together, not hesitant and reluctant. I would also hope that upon seeing my daily suffering from the construction site and lack of viable alternatives, my partner would want to do anything possible to help me exit such a stressful and damaging situation. I do try to be understanding with him, though, because he has previously expressed that he sees living together as basically the same as marriage, whereas I see it as a necessary step before even considering marriage or children. (Which, by the way, he has confirmed many times that he does want to have children of his own.)\n\nI have brought it up with him several times during the last year and every time it's a no. Last time I brought it up I told him I was giving up on the idea. I don't want to force or pressure him into it. I want him to want it like I do. But if he doesn't... what can I do? Should I wait a while longer and see if he comes around? Cut my losses? Try moving to a new apartment of my own and reconsider why I want to live together in the first place? Bring it up and try to talk through it yet again?\n\nI really want us to work but I feel as though he has all the power and agency in the relationship at this point. I don't want to lose out on my opportunity to have a family because I'm waiting for someone else to make a decision.\n\n  \nAny advice is welcome! Again, I really love him and want to make it work with him if possible. \n\nTL;DR- My boyfriend of 5 years still doesn't want to live together despite the fact that we are in our 30's and my living situation sucks.   \n",

      "title": "Best Friend's Boyfriend Totally Sucks",
      "content": "My (24F) best friend, 'C' (24F) has recently started dating my boyfriend's (25M), friend (24M), 'N'. \n\nFor context, they met around New Years 2025, so it has only been 5 whole months that they have been dating. At first, he seemed cool and fun, I symathized with his broken past (orphaned, parents used to do drugs, his parents both recently died within a year). \n\nHowever, his insecurities cause many issues for their relationship. Starting with the first fight they had, which was around March (3 months dating), he got upset with her for not admitting her body count, which he demanded to know. She never answered because she knew it would only lead to a negative reaction, or it just didn't matter. Weird, right? He explained that it is important for him to know things like this. Within this same conversation, C mentioned a friend who has been 'hooking up' with this girl she knows from her school. He got furious that her friends subscribe to hook up culture, and that it is a bad reflection of her having these kinds of people in her life (to influence her). Lastly, he asked if she has ever dated a black guy (they are both white), to which she truthfully responds, 'yes'. That fight blows over, but the more recent, prolonged one ensued as follows.\n\nC got accepted to study abroad for the summer (1 month). She applied well before she even met N. The days leading up to her leaving, N expressed he was uncomfortable and even admitted insecure about her leaving. He mentioned again, he does not even know her body count or her whole dating history, and to top it off, he also cannot stop thinking about the black guy (lol). He claimed that not knowing these things attributed to not knowing her character. So, she needs to prove herself worthy to him. Ew! This broke her heart that he needed all this extra info to be able to think well of her, because he could only imagine what she has done in her past. The entire week before leaving, she was anxious due to his unstable emotions. Another instance was she and N went to her hometown 45 min away to visit her parents and friends who came from out of town to have a reunion/going away party. N chose to finish his hw that night, so he was not present during the party and he did not even say goodbye to everyone that night. This also hurt her feelings, of course. Overall, they fought about everything and she would tell me how she was constantly crying. To me, how can a grown man be okay with making his woman cry? \n\nHe also constantly drags C for working too much. She is in law school and also works at a firm as an apprentice lawyer under supervision of her boss. N is in school for Kinesiology so he claims the stress is killing her. Also, he hates her cat. I think both of these things are 'distractions that divert her attention away from him'. He has not admitted this, but it is what it seems. When he should be supportive, he tries to tear her down. I have dated a very toxic guy before, and I can see a lot of similarities in him.\n\nI highly respect my friend, and I love her so much, but I am afraid of losing her. Whether it be because she ditches her friends to give attention to N, or I get too fed up with constantly hearing about what she puts up with.\n\nI suppose I am asking reddit for advice? \n\n  \nTL;DR. Best friend dating very insecure guy, and now i hate him and I am unsure what to do.",

      "title": "Husband too close to co-worker during postpartum period?",
      "content": "I’m going to try and keep this as brief as possible but some detail is needed for context.\n\nTLDR:\n\nHusband daily messaging attractive female co-worker for months when I was struggling on maternity leave alone with a newborn, after I’d previously raised concerns about her. 18 months have passed and still can’t trust/forgive. \n\nFull post:\n\nMy husband (34M) and I (34F) work for the same company (in very different areas of the business) and have a two year old. We’ve been together going on 9 years and married for almost 4. I’d say we’ve had a fairly happy, close relationship aside from this issue other than typical relationship bickering and some differences which periodically rear their heads. \n\nHowever, 18 months ago, when I was 6 months postpartum and on maternity leave, I found out my husband had been communicating heavily with a female co-worker in his area who he used to manage. She’s around 5 years younger, attractive, unmarried, no kids, a boyfriend she seems not very interested in and successful in her career (significantly more senior in the business than myself and in the same role as my husband). \n\nTo this day, I still do not know the full extent of their relationship but I do know they exchanged messages on the work system most days (often for a lot of the day) for several months until I found out, during the period after we had our baby. My husband was primarily working from home during this time so he’d be messaging her upstairs around doing his work whilst I was downstairs in the house, really quite struggling, alone with a very demanding newborn that we had various particular challenges with. \n\nI only had opportunity to skim small portions of the messages but the chats were mostly day to day chit chat, confiding in one another about work matters or annoyances, mildly flirtatious humour but I didn’t see anything particularly worrying as far as confessing feelings, no criticism of each of their relationships etc. But like I say, I only read a small proportion of it all and given his demeanour when showing me the messages and a comment he made that ‘I would be upset if I read them’, my assumption is there was stuff lurking in there that may have been worse.\n\nWhen this all came out, it also transpired that he had been deleting her name from his list of work chats to hide it from me, should I have looked at his computer (as the messages themselves can’t be deleted). \n\nA key point here is that I’d raised questions/concerns about his relationship with this girl a few times over the course of around two years prior to me finding out the above. I’d previously asked if they message etc and he’d essentially said no. My concerns were prompted by behaviour I’d witnessed with my own eyes (which I was only privy too because, as above, we work for the same company and therefore both attend some big events) consisting of her being a big drinker who becomes very tactile when drunk - albeit, with a lot of men, but that included my husband. I could also just ‘sense’ an atmosphere between them that hinted to me there were some feelings on one or both sides. Some frostiness from her towards me. There’d be some subtle behaviour changes from him that I’d thought may link to her, including: seeming to maybe be paying more attention to his appearance when she would be in the office, seeming never to miss a night out when she’d be there and often not inviting me along, continuing to have regular diarised catch-ups with her at work despite no longer being necessary for work reasons, my husband always having headphones on for meetings at home so I couldn’t hear anything. He has good explanations for all of this/would say its coincidental or I was reading into things. \n\nMy husband maintains strongly to this day that he was only ever friends with this girl. He refuses to accept any feelings were held. I absolutely cannot believe this for one second on the basis of everything I know. Why would he be willing to repeatedly lie to me and risk our relationship when we’ve just had a child for some ‘friend’? He alleges his secrecy was because he knew I’d unfairly react about him having a female friend if I found out given what I’d asked about her previously. He alleges nothing more ever happened. \n\nAfter I found out, he massively reduced communication with her (from what I understand) but was still having periodic unnecessary catch ups (which he said was bc it would seem odd and cause trouble for him to cancel them) until I raised it didn’t feel fair, and would still hang out a little at the odd work event or chat in the office. He left the company recently so I believe all communication has now stopped. \n\nThe problem is, 18 months on, I just can’t get over it.  I don’t believe he has been honest with me about the nature of the relationship since I found out about this, which perpetuates my lack of trust and has made it harder to move on from. Our lives have been back to normal from about a week after this all happened, although with periodic conversations about it when I can’t help myself but communicate its on my mind. But I just cannot accept that he would do this when I was at my most vulnerable with our new baby after I’d said so many times previously that I was worried about her and he’d told me I was being silly. Even if nothing ever physically came of it. I can’t shake a sense of not being emotionally safe with him and not being able to trust him. \n\nDoes anyone have any advice on how to rebuild trust and move on from something like this? \n\nIt’s worth saying, my husband does have a lot going for him: is very attractive, funny, confident, intelligent and also happens to earn a lot of money, which primarily funds our lifestyle. Obviously none of this is enough if hes not also, and more importantly, kind and trustworthy, however I really don’t want to break up our family whilst we have young child(ren) if avoidable. ",

The only thing that comes to mind is that I got upset over group chat messages because they didn't tell me about an exam after I couldn't attend a lecture (basically saying similar to \"why didn't anyone tell me😭\" ). The final message I sent on this theme was never seen by 22F and was sent two weeks ago. But even before this they have been super weird and avoiding me since the easter term started (April/May). I know this is more than overthinking when at a birthday party 23M avoided me then walked home with another friend (23NB) without me, leaving me alone in a part of the city I feel very unsafe in . \n\nSo what do I do? I've messaged them both privately saying similar to: \"if you aren't busy we could do something but it's no issue if not\". Should I have messaged them privately? And if they don't reply do I just give up? Because it will be very awkward in the graduations to be seeing and sitting by them, especially as now I'm upset at them for ignoring me both online and in person. Have I misconstrued it and they are just wrapped up in their own problems and aren't texting me back because of them? \n\nThanks in advance reddit \n\nTL;DR uni classmates are icing me out, what do i do? Especially as I am seeing them at graduation and I care about them\n\nEdited for my terrible grammer😭",

      "title": "I (31F) am tired of initiating contact with friends and family. Should I stop? Opinions welcomed.",
      "content": "Hey everyone. I’m feeling disappointed in pretty much all of my friends and family at the moment. \n\nI’m not one to play victim as I believe some people are a glutton for punishment, and should take responsibility for their own (inter)actions.\n\nI’m very understanding of that fact that most of my friends work AND have children (and I don’t have kids). Also understanding of family members who either aren’t 100% in health, or work demanding jobs, or are airy fairy student types… but I’m SO SICK of always checking in on them first. Asking what’s new. Asking when they’re free to meet for a coffee.\n\nMy sister (21F) replied today to a text I sent her TWO WEEKS AGO asking if she wanted to hang out this coming weekend.  She’s usually at Uni in different city but is back for the summer. I never hear from her when she’s out of town and I let it slide since she’s so much younger, and I appreciate that talking to her big sister might not be high on her social agenda. Whenever we do actually hang out we get we get on so well and I love her to pieces! \n\nSince she returned in April I’ve seen her twice (she’s not working by the way). Once to help set up our mum’s small birthday party, and again to help clear the house a bit. No comms outside of this. \n\nShe replied with “hey!!! Sorry I’ve been super busy and didn’t see your text. Sorry I can’t hang this weekend I’m visiting my boyfriend or I totally would!” (bf still at his uni in a different city). \n\nI’d had it by this point so I replied with “Two weeks. There’s busy, then there’s just inconsiderate, especially when someone else is trying to make an effort. Everyone has stuff on but it takes 2 seconds to reply, even if you can’t make it or to say you’re not feeling 100%, which I’d be understanding of. Have some courtesy.”\n\nNo reply since (obviously).\n\nBut it’s not just her. It’s most people. It hurts because whenever we do speak properly, or meet up with these people it’s lovely and we roar with laughter and they’re all “gosh it’s crazy at the moment! I’m so sorry it’s been so long, but it’s been amazing catching up!”.\n\nThese are people I’ve known YEARS (or my whole life!), and have had the deepest conversations with. I had to have an emergency appendectomy last year and they really showed up for me, and I’ll be forever grateful. \n\nBut after that, back to usual. The most I usually get is a meme or funny clip sent to me. Not actually asking after me. I think I would feel unreasonable messaging them with “I just feel sad, that whilst you’re busy with a hormonal teenager and a toddler, and also work, and are working to stay on the wagon, that after all these years of friendship you don’t take the time to text ME”…. \n\n\nI have a lovely encouraging partner, we live together and have pets and our own thing going on - so I’m not twiddling my thumbs, but the resentment for others has just been building gradually.\n\n\nI’m sure you’re thinking “they’re just used to you messaging first!” … but don’t they want to know how I am if they haven’t heard from me in a while? Or maybe you’re thinking “just meet some new friends!”. You’re talking to the woman who doesn’t like sports/outdoorsy stuff, games, cooking, crafting. Transparently, volunteering sounds like a hole in the head. Relaxing watching a good telly series is my preference. I work a very peopley job, and I’m just not sure I have it in me to be Tour Guide Barbie with new people…. But something has to change. \n\n\nI think I’m going to test a month of not initiating contact and see what happens. I might laugh / heart react to a meme if it’s sent… But unless it’s a genuine question I won’t reply.\n\nCare to weigh in? \n\nAny personal experience? \n\nPerhaps the opinion from someone who’s guilty of forgetting to message friends? No hate.\n\nThank you",

      "content": "So me (21 F) and my bf (24M) have been together for about a year now and he recently started working at this restaurant with this girl (23F) who he just can’t seem to stop talking about. He’s told me that she’s super nice and exactly like him and he’s always laughing with her. He wanted me to try and be friends with her and so I’ve met her and she seems super sweet but again I’ve only met her once so I don’t think I trust her yet.\n\nWhen we chatted she (and his other coworkers) mentioned just how much he talks about me so that had put my mind to ease a little. However it didn’t last long when he told me that he had asked her (and this other guy he works with) to hangout after work which really really bothered me bc he doesn’t even hangout with his closest friends like that, let alone people he just met. She did tell him that she couldn’t tho so he ended up not hanging out with them so I got over it and moved on.\n\nNow this is where I can’t seem to understand if it’s okay or not, so a couple days ago he was fired and he told me that he had gotten her number to stay in touch. That to me was weird it doesn’t feel right because he’d only just known her for ab a month max. Well like a day or two ago he said that she had told him that her boyfriend didn’t like him and that he was super jealous of him that they’d have to text in secret but that she had also mentioned that her boyfriend beats up guys that flirt with her and my boyfriend had joked saying “well does it look like I can beat him up?” and she said “no he does boxing” (don’t know if those words are verbatim it’s just what my bf told me). To me that completely threw me off the rails because Does that mean he flirts with her? To the point that she mentioned it and he played along? But then He later told me that it made him uncomfortable having to text her in secret because he didn’t like feeling like he was doing something wrong.\n\nIn my past relationship I was cheated on throughout the whole time so it’s hindered my ability to feel secure in a relationship. So I don’t know if this is me being insecure or is this something that I should be concerned about?\n\nTL;DR my boyfriend has been talking about this girl he just met at work, has tried to hangout with her, and now has her number but doesn’t feel comfortable texting her since her boyfriend is jealous of him and she told him they’d have to talk in secret, should I be concerned if he has a thing for her?",

He didn’t message me the next day which again I wasn’t really too worried about it. The next day he texted me and i went over and we hung out and hooked up again. Since then I’ve been over everyday. He seems like a decent guy and says he wants to get to know me more. I mean he seemed into me and he knows I just got out of a relationship. Fast forward to yesterday we were texting in the morning .. he called me on his lunch break and says let’s go eat tacos around 630ish.. I said cool I’m down. And ever since then I never heard from him again. I’m not the type to chase or message him to “follow up” so I just went out with my friends instead. It just left me confused and annoyed. Is he playing games? He’s very attractive so idk if his talking to anyone else and I told him to be open about it because we are not committed and his entitled but I just want to know. He said no his not like that and blah blah .. but at this point I’m like do I even want to continue this .. my last relationship was toxic and just don’t want to repeat the same thing and I feel like I should just block him and let it be?

      "content": "\nSO my boyfriend and i started dating just under a year ago. Met in college, he had a crush on me first, yadayada. Honestly i went through a long period of “do i really want to date this guy?” because i was generally uncomfortable with men after coming out of a relationship 6 months before.  and-yes- he wasn’t extremely attractive. but i figured i had healed enough and by this point he was starting to win me over. he was treating me much better than my ex, paying for my food, opening doors, getting me flowers, etc. which was great!! (he still does most of these) there are only maybe a few things that i don’t like THAT much but nobody can be perfect, right? and they’re not huge deals. \n\n1. he isn’t super talkative when we’re alone- which is a huge difference from my ex (we were both yappers) now mostly i am the only one who yaps. although this has slowly been getting better and sometimes we really do hit it off and have fun conversations! his family are quiet people so i assume that’s where it came from. also i know that everyone is different and we should not compare exes but it was hard to get used to at first\n2. he’s a little bit more… horny than me but he doesn’t seem to get upset if i ever turn anything down- which isn’t often\n3. he can get upset when i forget something (usually minor) about his schedule, which is valid, but i basically have to live off of a calendar in order to stay organized- im very forgetful. my whole fam is like this so i guess he’s just not used to it which is valid! ive been working on it\n\nthese are generally small things. in general, i am very comfortable with him and i dont ever have the feeling that i need to validate his love for me all the time (or moreso chase after his attention) than i did with my ex. he’s a lot more laid back and im just generally more comfortable with him- the year with him has flown by easily! \nso here’s the problem… my family is very much concerned that i do not actually like him becauuuseee…\n1. they think he’s not attractive enough for me (they have a big problem with his height… he’s the same height as me?)\n2. he’s kind of quiet and meek- especially the times when he’s met them \n3. they don’t hear much about him \nBig emphasis on the not attractive part- they think i should explore my options more before i settle\n\nmy problem:\nit’s annoying because every time they say this and i think about it too hard- i do get really worried that ive “settled for less” and it really gets in my head. but when im with him, i never think of these things. he’s fun to be around(most of the time, still working on that lol), im comfortable with him,  and generally it’s a breath of fresh air, and yes i do find him mostly attractive, but mostly love him for how he loves me and his personality (he’s cute)\nBUT i don’t know if I would marry him (although this could probably come from fears of marriage and long-term commitment anyways considering divorce runs in my family)\n\ni just don’t know. do i break his heart and explore options? should i be dating someone who’s “attractive enough” for me? am i just being caught up in my head? do i need to worry about marrying him? should i even talk about that with him??? we’re young in my eyes but i don’t know how he’s been raised. \n\nTLDR; my moms side of the family (and even my dad…) thinks my bf is “not attractive enough” for me and that i need to explore my options, but im very comfortable with my bf and find him attractive on my own way. fears of commitment and wondering if i should listen to them or not? \n\n",

I’ve felt him being distant but it’s not like he doesn’t tell me he loves me or cares for me. it’s just the small things are adding up and im realizing them. he doesn’t update me as much when goinh out with friends, he only calls me when i ask,, he walks in front of me now so we rarely hold hands in public,, he doesn’t compliment me other than the “you looked good today”. sometimes he doesn’t even kiss me until i say something or I initiate it. yhe love letters bave stopped and flowers are rare. when he comes over hes on his phone or when we’re eating hes on his phone. it feels like hes uninterested in our conversations? I don’t want to call him a bad boyfriend because he is so sweet when he wants to be. im a very emotional girl and I have been tjrough some difficult relationships so am I overthinking everything? I cry a lot and he always comforts me when I do,, and he still takes me on dates sometimes and it’s fun but i have this achy feeling that something is different. I know he’s not cheating as he never hides his phone from me (my Face ID is on his phone so I legit have access to it plus I snooped bc I got paranoid and ik that’s bad and I felt bad for doing it but there wasn’t a single thing on there) and he shares his location with me. his mom also loves me and his home all of the time so there’s no way there. my family adores him and he’s the first guy they’ve met,, and im his first girlfriend too. i love him very much and I always ran away at the firsy sign of imperfection in a relationship but I’m trying to stay and work with this because it’s so different with him. am I crazy? I’ve talked to him a bit about how I feel but I don’t want to come across as a bad girlfriend who complains all the time. am I being a dumb teenager ? He talks about our future together like I don’t gwt it. I feel neglected but loved at the same time. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up and I truly believe he still loves me. Any advice would be good please. PS. we haven’t had sex in about 8 ish months mainly bc of me (paranoid of pregnancy!) But we have been intimate in other ways! I always satisfy his needs but I don’t know if the lack of actual intimacy is the issue?  \n\n\nTLDR; boyfriend being distant lately but I don’t want to break up. What do I do? Am I being too clingy?",

We would see each other 2x per week and a few messages every day, but it was slowly decreasing from there to where some days would have pretty much no messages. There was also tension surrounding a specific grooming habit, ie, his facial hair was distractingly long and even once had food stuck in it when he came over.I have been asking him to please reconsider the break up, as the relationship has been amazing otherwise, we seemed super compatible in bed and have numerous crossed interests. I integrated into his friend group easily. I sincerely enjoyed his family.\n\nHis responses have been that he believes I will find someone better for myself, that he isn't sure he wants to date anyone, he doesnt want kids (I do not either) or to ever get married (being together would be enough for me). That he may need a couple years alone. He said he will cherish the relationship memories, and he is still down to be friends.\n\nHow do I navigate this in a way that could end up with us being together ? Is there any possible hope here ? Our relationship was so cute and I had one of the best years of my life, with him by my side. I have dated quite a lot of people and I am serious when I believe he is the one for me. How can I be the one for him again? He once asked me to move in with him but I wasnt sure about the commute.. If I had moved in, our lack of seeing each other would have never been an issue.

      "title": "My (F 20) former hook up buddy (M 24) keeps reaching out to me while he’s in a new relationship. Why- and do I tell the girl?",
      "content": "So this guy and I used to be coworkers. He was basically my team leader. I worked there for 3 years, and the second year of me working there he suddenly started flirting with me, asking me to go on dates, and hanging out. Eventually, we did go on a date or two. After that we had a sexual relationship, I think because he realized he didn’t want to be in an actual relationship with me. I used to be in love with him, although I now think that that was mainly a trauma bond in disguise, so I kind of stuck with him. After dating for a year, we had a sexual relationship for two years. Now, a little more than a month ago, he was texting me and asking me when he could come over, telling me he missed me, etc. Three days later, I saw that he had removed me from his private story. I was confused, and decided to tell him that I knew when I’d be home alone, just so I could see his reaction. Mind you, this was THREE days after him being so affectionate. Suddenly, he replied that he was dating someone new and wanted to be honest... My instincts were right. I reacted calmly, and I was expecting us not to have any contact. I removed him from my private story, didn’t text him or send him any snaps; nothing. Mainly because I didn’t want to be complicit to an unfair situation towards the girl he’s dating with. But to my surprise, he had re-added me to his private story 2 days after telling me, and now keeps texting me every now and then, asking me how my studies are going (we both study medicine, he just finished). It’s the exact same sort of useless dull question every time. The convos aren’t sexual and don’t have a flirting undertone, but they just feel very… unnecessary? I figured that maybe he wasn’t that serious with her, until I saw on WhatsApp that he changed his profile picture to a picture with her. He also removed other people who I know he was dating/seeing, which makes me even more confused, because why the hell are you trying to stay in contact with ME, when our relationship was solely sexual. I.e; we never met up without doing anything sexual, and I don’t think I offer him anything that his girlfriend/friends can’t offer. I know for a fact he didn’t care about me beyond how I was fulfilling his sexual desires, because otherwise he would’ve treated me differently. I’m totally confused why he keeps reaching out, but my main question is, do I have a responsibility in informing his supposed girlfriend of this, even though the convos aren’t sexual or flirty? I don’t want to open a can of drama, but I’m not sure what’s right.. I just know I definitely would not like my boyfriend doing this if I were her. \n\nTL;DR: Had a 2-3 year sexual relationship with a former coworke. A month ago he was still affectionate, then suddenly said he was dating someone new. I backed off, but he keeps messaging me casually. Now I’m confused why he still reaches out and whether I should tell his girlfriend, even though it’s not flirty.",

So last week, I told her, I would wish for a little bit more initimacy. It was a little wierd, but I thought it went well. She told me, she just wasn't ready yet. And I was okay with that.

In the evening I wanted to clarify this situation and talk with her on the phone, to which she annoyedly agreed. So we talked about it and came to the conclussion, that we both need to talk about our Emotions and speek to each other, if we have a problem. Also, she is a very active talker, but im very social awkward and not really good al talking or expressing my feelings. She wanted me to talk more about myself, so she doesn't has to talk all the time. I understood  her feelings, an want to try my best in the future. But even so, I am still not sure, if we really safed our relationship. She's visiting her parents for a week, and I am scared, that she will brake up with me, when she comes back.

      "title": "My 26m 3 year relationship 28f says she feels pressured to have sex but doesn’t allow me to be non sexual either is a paradox",
      "content": "\n\n\nHey r/relationships, I'm struggling and could use some outside perspective. My girlfriend 28 and I 26m have been together for almost 3 years, and things have felt off for a while, especially around intimacy.\nShe recently told me that she feels pressured to have sex when we hang out, wants to just relax and lay down, and thinks I \"don't enjoy that.\" \n\nNow, I hear her and I want her to feel safe and comfortable. I would never ever pressure or want to make her feel pressured. The thing is, I've been trying so hard to do exactly what she's asking for. I constantly invite her to hang out non-sexually—just to chill, watch a movie, go for a walk, grab food, anything low-key. But she almost always declines. We used to spend so much time together, and now it feels like she actively avoids it.\nThis leaves me in a really confusing and painful spot. She says she wants non-sexual intimacy, but then rejects my attempts to provide it. Meanwhile, our sexual intimacy has plummeted. She used to be so  into sex with me, but now it's maybe once every two weeks, if that, and it feels like the opposite of how she used to be. This frequency isn't fair to my needs in a relationship. This is turning into a looping paradox. I of course want to have sex with her, but  want her to want that too. She says that “\nShe still does” but her actions show very much otherwise. \n\nI've tried talking about it, but it often circles back to her feeling pressured or me \"making her feel bad.\" I've even brought up if she's holding onto any resentment from the past (I never cheated or anything, just maybe didn't always meet all her needs perfectly at earlier points) and told her it's important she be honest if that's the case yet she says not at all. But I still feel like she's not acknowledging my efforts or how her constant rejection (both sexual and non-sexual) makes me feel. I feel unwanted, confused, and like she just doesn't care about spending time with me anymore, in any capacity. She makes me feel bad for wanting sex, but then I offer non sexual hangouts ( which I enjoy a lot too ) and she doesn’t really want that either, it’s a cycle of this which she says she feels pressured, blames it on not having non sexual hanging out, doesn’t allow us to have those non sexual hang outs, then it continues into a spiral. \nIt's an almost 3-year relationship, and I love her, but I can't keep feeling this way. Is this just a fundamental incompatibility? How do I even approach this when it feels like she's rejecting all forms of connection, despite her own stated needs? Do we just break up?\nThanks \n\n\nTLDR; gf says she feels pressured to have sex when we hangout, but I always try to hangout non sexually, she doesn’t want that either, weeks go by without sex and it creates a spiral of feeling bad ",

He’s kind, funny, a good listener, always takes care of me and makes me feel very loved and seen. We have the same interests, humor and he’s already the person I feel I can be the best and most genuine version of myself around. \n\nThere’s just one problem - I've never had the “butterflies” around him and I haven’t really been obsessed in the sense I believe most people are in the honeymoon phase. Even though I've thought about him a lot, fantasized about him, looked at pictures of him before going to sleep and even started to cry multiple times because I've felt so touched by how lovely of a person he is - I couldn’t really escape the feeling that something maybe was missing because of the lack of butterflies or having to catch my breath by the sight of him.\n\nAround a month ago this concern developed into anxiety. I believe it to be a mix of the concern regarding the butterflies and the fact that we'd been together for awhile and it all started to feel more serious, more everyday-like. I don’t feel the need to reach out to him all the time anymore, my libido isn’t as high and I can sometimes experience a feeling of boredom when we’re together. Every time I catch myself feeling a negative feeling around him I become anxious - which has also led me to, to some extent, connect him to feelings of anxiety. What’s maybe also worth mentioning is that I always experience a sense of emptyness during summer.\n\nHowever, right now I can’t escape the feeling of hopelessness. I love him and I can’t imagine being without him, but the future all of a sudden feels scary. I'm scared of being unhappy, but the only one I want to be happy with is him. How can I get over these feelings and start enjoying my relationship with my wonderful boyfriend again?\n\nTL;DR - Experiencing anxiety in an otherwise perfect relationship and don’t know how to move on.",

      "content": "We were friends from 10-22. It ended when I treated her terribly by misplacing my frustration and anger onto her. I got pregnant at 18, barely graduated high school and went into a trade school. I started to get angry that she was a normal teenager going on dates and being care free while I was struggling to learn how to be an adult and become independent without help. I started to think of all the ways her life could go wrong to make myself feel better and started voicing it to her. She confronted me and I couldn’t face my behavior due to shame so I doubled down. We stopped speaking for 10 years after that. \n\nSince then, I had 2 more kids. I got laid off during the pandemic, and my sister started having serious health issues. I wasn’t able to find a job due to it being one of the first to be taken over by AI. I now work as my sisters carer full time while looking after my toddler and her two kids while my oldest are in school. I’ve been in a custody battle for years over my youngest and live in a shitty small town I can’t leave because of the custody. I started feeling lonely and isolated lately and have considered apologizing for years but only got the courage up a few months ago. She forgave me and we’ve been catching up, but now I’m regretting being friends with her again because my issues with her from the past are coming back. \n\nShe is still in a way better position than me but on crack now. Her husband got lucky and sold a book for nearly a million dollars, invested 100% of it and now he’s a multimillionaire, making a couple million dollars every few months. He’s so rich they don’t actually know the rate at which his worth increases because it’s so large it doesn’t matter. They don’t live like they’re rich and only spend like 60k a year which kinda makes my jealousy better but it’s the fact that they have a choice and that they will definitely increase that yearly amount whenever they want to that makes me jealous. He’s buying her a new smart car this year and they have plans to move back to our hometown and build their own home. I can’t use their relationship being shitty for comfort because it’s not. They’re literal best friends and were for years before dating. Their relationship is happy and wonderful according to her. \n\nShe spends her day doing nothing. She has a million hobbies and can learn basically anything due to free time and the fact that she’s so used to learning new skills out of boredom. She can now speak German, Spanish, and is learning Italian, she bakes, cooks all their meals by scratch simply because she wants to, makes and sells art, does 3D modeling and animation, is writing a book, and developing a video game. To help build their house she’s learning fucking engineering on YouTube. All these skills outside of writing her book are new to me. Neither her or her husband work so these are all just things she does by choice out of free time. And I know part of this is just my own choices. I actually have a lot of free time between caring for my sister and the kids but I just spend most of it reading or watching tv so there’s no reason I couldn’t just take up these hobbies instead. Her life isn’t perfect obviously. Shes chronically ill making it impossible for her to do much some days and the more sedentary hobbies occupy her time when she’s sick but still. Shes a good person who deserves a comfortable life with no worries like this and I guess it’s my own karma but I’m back to feeling jealous and angry and don’t know how to handle it. ",

I have tried for years to get him to learn about low reactive behaviour/low-affective attitude, but he thinks he does it.\n\nHe isn't a talker, a lot of his communication is between the lines, and I find him hard to read. I didn't before, when I thought he said what he thought and nothing else. It's confusing for me. When I try to talk about being low-affective with him, he reacts really poorly or just doesn't respond at all.\n\nI have no idea of how to communicate that we really need to go to therapy. My mental health is affecting my physical health, and he doesn't seem to care. I get the sinking feeling he doesn't want to be here with us anymore, but I don't know because he doesn't talk to me.

      "content": "so today i texted my boyfriend this pic of me with a filter of blonde hair (i am brunette) and was like “would it be bad LOL” and he says yes then goes into how i’m suddenly changing everything about myself and questioning why i need to change and that i’m chasing change. i asked him what he meant and his response was, getting curtain bangs, doing heartless curls 2 nights in a row (helps blend the bangs and i told him that) doing my own nails, taking my lash extensions off, and waxing instead of shaving (just my bikini area) i told him that really the only change I’ve made is the bangs and my lashes because i (1) missed the curtain bangs since I’ve grown out my hair a bunch and (2) the lashes are expensive and a lot of upkeep. I’ve been doing my own nails since December 2024 and waxing or shaving i’m still removing the hair it’s just more convenient for me and we had a whole conversation about waxing, looking into a wax pass, why i’m doing it, etc. before i started going and he had no problem with it then. \n\ni’m just not really sure how to feel. like i have expressed wanting to do something different with my hair for a while now and my curtain bangs was one thing and i’m not gonna up and get my hair colored tomorrow and he knows that. and i appreciate his opinion and if i was serious about making that kind of change i would like to talk to him about it and hear his thoughts but this was a simple ‘think i could pull off blonde?’ kinda thing. didn’t even say i’m thinking about going blonde, because i’m not it was just a silly little filter i tried. but it quickly turned into why are you doing all of this, you’re changing everything about you, etc. etc. \n\ni’m not sure if i’m reading to much into this because i was in a previous relationship where my ex partner wouldn’t let me do certain things but also i don’t think it’s fair to say that i’m making all these changes to myself and it seems like there’s some feelings behind his statements he has not brought up to me. \n\nTLDR: sent my bf a picture of me with a blonde filter asking if i could pull it off and he his response was basically ‘why do you feel the sudden need to change everything about yourself’ when the only thing i’ve really changed is taking off my lash extensions and doing curtain bangs (again) ",

      "content": "Hello Reddit. I’m really struggling right now and would really appreciate some outside perspective. \n\nMy best friend (29F) is moving across the country soon, and I’ve (28M) been struggling emotionally with the shift. We’ve grown very close over the friendship. Had many deep conversations, plenty of emotional support, and a genuine closeness that felt so unique and special. As her move approached I started feeling very anxious, sad, and a bit abandoned, even though I’m fully supportive of the move and I know that this is what’s best for her.\n\nOver the past few weeks I’ve unintentionally guilt-tripped her over how she’s spending her time left here. I never meant to pressure her, but I now know that I wasn’t being fair or respectful to her autonomy and space. She recently sent me a message saying that she’s been feeling burnt out by the guilt and that the friendship hasn’t felt respectful since she told me the news. She said that she still cares about me and that she just needs to prioritize herself and the relationships that support her right now.\n\nI responded by sincerely apologizing and taking accountability for my actions, expressing that I never meant to hurt her and fully understand if she needs to take space. I told her that I care about her a lot and that I hope we can reconnect in the future when it feels right. She responded that she appreciated the apology, that we’re all good, and that it wasn’t goodbye. She just wanted to be transparent about where she’s at right now.\n\nSo currently I’m sitting with the weight of all this. I’m partly relieved that it’s “not goodbye,” but still grieving the closeness we’ve lost. Do you think this friendship can be recovered?\n\nThanks in advance. This is one of the most meaningful friendships I’ve ever had, and I’m trying to handle this in the most mature and loving way even if the outcome is uncertain.\n\nTL;DR: My best friend is moving, and I unintentionally guilt-tripped her about how she’s spending her time. She said she needs space and the friendship hasn’t felt respectful. I apologized, and she said it’s “not goodbye,” just where she’s at right now. I’m struggling with the shift and not sure how to move forward and recover the friendship.",

      "content": "I'm at my wits end. I love this man with all my heart but at this point I can tell when the evening is going to be shit or not. He hates his job, it's very demanding. So he's usually pretty disgruntled after work.\n\nIt's important to add his upbringing. He was in an abusive household. Screaming and hitting was what he dealt with since he was young. He tends to yell often as he says \"that's how he is heard\" as when he was younger that's all he knew.\n\nExample, he got off work and had a bad day. I tried lightening the mood and such and it kind of worked. I picked up sons and brought them home. Where we live is the first time we have all had a house not with my mother, so more space and they're still learning how to clean and stuff.\n\nSon got cereal. Fiance asked what he was doing and I told him eating cereal. He started raising his voice saying \"they need to learn to fucking close boxes of foods everything is fucking open\" so I go out there and explain to son that he needs to close the box. Fiance comes flying in and starts cursing and yelling at him to close shit. I stepped in and trying to be calm showing son how to do it, fiance storms out.\n\nHe left and is now texting me claiming I don't have his back and im a \"real piece of work\" and that no one listens to him. I tried to deescalate and tried to explain i did have his back but I didn't want to put the fear of God in sons to do that. I said im choosing to leave the convo as he made the piece of work comment and it was rude.\n\nThis happens every few days. He is now offended that I told him how his bad days effect us all and I am willing to help. But now we're going to have another night of him slamming doors and ignoring us if he even comes home.......idk what to do. He doesn't want to talk it out because he gets SO defensive if I say anything negative about his behavior.\n\nTdlr; fiance screams at us on his bad days and will start being nasty nk matter what I say or do and just gives me the silent treatment until he's over it. We can't talk it out because he immediately gets angry and mean\n",

      "title": "How to maintain this friendship?",
      "content": "Hey all,\n\nThis is gonna be a bit long, but I just need to get this off my chest and I feel like I have no one to talk to about this. I just need advice and want to get this out before I do something stupid. I'm also very emotionally charged, so it's gonna sound angry. Sorry for that, but I want to do the right thing and figure out how to navigate this friendship. Chatgpt helped a lot in helping me learn my own emotions and how to navigate certain situations and interactions, but I literally crave talking about this to real people. I don't really have close friends I talk about this with except my husband. I'm thinking about talking to a mutual friend while prefacing to them I'm not trying to start drama but I'm scared to bring it up to them. I think this mutual friend can be trustworthy and I think they can read situations well...I just want to resolve this silently without stirring anything.. which is why I'm here. I feel pathetic but I need help.\n\nI'm part of a small group that's me, my SO, and 2 others we'll name Albert and Dan (made up names). We also hang with a larger group a lot of times. My issue is with Albert. When I first met them through my SO, they seemed nice and respond to people well to make them feel welcome and part of the group. We started playing games together and eventually played with Dan as well. It's been a few years now, and right now I don't feel so great about Albert. I tried talking to him here and there, and they are hard to read sometimes. I don't think that's anything special.. I feel like I had a small breakthrough when I talked to them a couple months ago, they're going through stuff so that's why they exuded so much negative energy. My take on this friend, after a few years of knowing them, is that they can be passive aggressive. They admitted to making jabs at my SO while they were going through some tough shit in life. He admitted he has an ego problem to my SO and said he felt my SO did as well, and felt like they were clashing. And admitted to him wanting to fail (like what?? honestly this made me so mad, but my husband is a very understanding person. He admitted feeling kind of lost and confused and just needed time to heal things, and now he's ok with Albert). That made me mad and I felt protective of my SO. Like.. what friend does that? Albert also says to my husband, \"what kind of friend does that?\" so he is AWARE. that is a positive but can that outweigh all these negative feelings I have towards them? That's why I'm here. And this talk was after a couple weeks of Albert ragequitting in a voice full of 8-10 people. I had a sense that it had to do with me or my SO, just a weird gut feeling although I don't think I did anything wrong. This gut feeling came from months and years of playing with them and kind of learning their patterns. and I was right when it was revealed what they talked about. Now, I feel like it's easier to read them since our talk and my gut feelings about all those time where I felt confused by their mood or responses.. was correct that they were actually in a mood or was mad at me or my SO and making jabs/passive aggressive remarks. I feel like they are so sneaky about it, and that's the worst part right now. Idk if I can call them a friend at this point. Because even from MY talk with them, after a week or 2 or so, it already feels like they're making jabs again. Even though they're easier to read, I still can't read this guy. It literally feels like a push-pull dynamic and I'm fucking exhausted.\n\nI know you are just hearing my side. Again, they're going through stuff right now that anyone can empathize with but honestly, I don't think this \"negative energy\" issue just pertains to his IRL issues. I think that's just how they are, because what I've felt time and time again has persisted throughout my time in knowing them. And I'm trying to think how do I continue on being friends with this person and NOT causing a ripple in our friend group or me slowly distancing myself from the group and still not causing a ripple that way either. It's hard because I don't have many friends, not like I share much of my life with them or others in my circle, but it's nice spending time with everyone.\n\nI haven't really dealt with this kind of personality so I need help. I also think they get along with Dan pretty well which also hurts sometimes because I feel like me and my SO are thirdwheeling in certain interactions.\n\nThank you if you read a lot of it, please be nice and honest and what your gleaning from this situation. I can answer any questions.\n\nTL;DR: How to maintain who I believe to be a pretty passive-aggressive friend. Very push-pull dynamic. Admitted to having an ego and \"hurting\" or wanting my SO to fail. Seems aware of their own issues but interacting with them has become exhausting/emotionally draining. I want to talk to a mutual friend but worried about causing ripples. I think they can be trustworthy. Also considering distancing myself from them but again worried about causing ripples/dynamic changes. I got no close friends to talk to :(",

      "title": "I (18M) have a strained relationship with my parents(49M and 45F) over favouratism between me and my brother (16M), and I don't know if I should confront them.",
      "content": "I (18M) have had a strained relationship with my brother(16M) and parents(49M and 45F) for a while, especially my mother and I have not always had the best relationship. I have long had trouble dealing with favoritism shown to my brother mostly from my mother.  \n\nThats not the only reasons for our strained relationship, but I won't delve into everything else because that should probably be in another post if I ever choose to make another. \n\nI had thought for a long time something was wrong with me, and didn't feel welcome at home. I felt like my brother was spoiled, and I always got the blame for everything.  \n\nBut I also felt ungrateful, and like it wasn't okay to blame my parents, I had no concrete proof other than the memories and experiences I had, and it's not like I can show them my memories and my side of things. I thought maybe the injustice I felt was just something I imagined, and once again that something was just wrong with me instead, since it wasn't like my life was bad by any means.  \n\nBecause of these feelings, and some other life circumstances, I developed major impostor syndrome, severe depression and minor anxiety. \n\nI have spoken with psychologists about this and sought help and is currently working through my issues. \n\nI did mention this to my parents' multiple times at a very young age (between the ages of 6 – 12). To be fair the way of asking was probably not the best but I was young and emotionally underdeveloped.  \n\nAt the time I asked why my parents loved my brother more than me, which after I have talked with experts, I know it’s the really the wrong question.  \n\nI always got the same answer; they didn't love him more than me, which I don't doubt.  \n\nI admit I probably wasn't easy as a kid, skipping school, fighting, temperamental issues, being friends with some less than good influences and alike. I know now I was acting out, but OfCourse I didn't know that at the time. \n\nNo kids are easy to raise, and my brother had his own issues, and I don't blame my brother. \n\nRecently I visited my grandmother, and she told me about her abusive mother and her mother's trauma and VERY blatant favoritism. She told me that ever since my brother was born my parents had Favored my brother, and that these feelings I had wasn't totally unfounded.  \n\nShe told me how my brother at a young age often threw tantrums when I got praise or other things and he didn't.  \n\nHe often hit and screamed when he didn't get something. He often took my stuff and proclaimed it was his, and whenever I told him or my parents this wasn't the case they got mad at me. \n\nShe told me how her and my mother had issues for these reasons because when she had mentioned this unfair behavior and how I always got the blame. When she did my mother always got mad and defensive and said my brother was an angel. \n\nShe told me she wasn't the only one in the family that had mentioned this. \n\nI OfCourse got mad and didn't know how to feel now that I finally had proof. It wasn't just something I thought, I had actual reason to feel the way I felt. It felt like a missing puzzle piece suddenly just fit, it explained so much of why I have felt the way I felt. \n\nWe talked for a long time about this and all the things she hadn't told me. I was a little mad she hadn't told me earlier, but She told me she didn't want to talk to me about this for a few reasons. \n\nShes my grandmother, not my mother. She was afraid this would ruin the relationship between me and my parents further and ruin the relationship between her and my parents. She was also afraid of what I would do with the information, and how I would react since I wasn't an adult. \n\nNow that I am an adult and because of all the emotional work I have been through she thought that I was ready to know. \n\nA few clear examples I remember, or she told me about from when i was very young: \n\nWhen I was about 4 or 5, me and my brother drew on the newly painted walls to the basement stairs of their house. Which I also have felt bad about and apologized many times for afterwards.  \n\nOfCourse my parents were furious and chose to sit me down on the terrace where they proceeded to yell at me and I wasn't allowed to move until we went home.  \n\nMy brother however got no such punishment and was allowed to go back to playing with my cousins. \n\nI only remember the drawing on the wall part of the story the rest was told to me by my grandmother. \n\n \n\nA few years back I took an interest in drumming from one of my uncles and played on drums whenever I could get my hands on a set. OfCourse I then wished for drums on my birthday that wasn't too far away.  \n\nMy parents told me beforehand that I wasn't allowed any form of acoustic drums because they were too noisy. That was fair in my eyes, OfCourse they didn't want drums slamming through the house, so I got silent electric drums. \n\nI then proceeded to ask my parents for drumming lessons, but they told me it was expensive and there was no one in the area. I then instead asked them for singing lessons because that interested me aswell - they told me no. \n\nA few years later my brother started taking up bass, he however didn't get I silent bass and still to this day blasts bass sounds through the house. Not only that he got a bass teacher. \n\nI have far more examples but if I wrote them all this post would be too long, and this is just to get my point across.  \n\nI also realize that I am the older brother and therefor has more responsibility and is expected to be more mature. \n\nI feel like our relationship can’t begin to heal before they admit this favoritism. I realize this is a giant ask, and my grandmother and therapist told me parents rarely admit this type of stuff before the sibling that was spoiled admits it, and I know my brother wont.  \n\nTl;dr I 18(M) has mental issues such as depression and impostor syndrome and recently found out from my grandmother that the feelings I had felt of unfair treatment in my childhood wasn't just something i imagined. \n\nI’m thinking of confronting my parents but is not sure of how or if i should even do it, but I feel like our relationship won't heal before they admit the differential treatment between me and my brother. \n\nPs sorry for bad grammar. ",

      "title": "Boyfriend lacks motivation to become independent",
      "content": "Hi, so I (21M) have been in a relationship with my boyfriend (20M), for 3 years now, and we started dating in high school. I left home to go to college in state, and he’s stayed at home. We come from very different backgrounds. I am an only child with parents who financially support me (helping me with rent as I go through school) and he has grown up in abject poverty, no hot water for the past while, living with grandparents as his parents have never been in the picture.\n\nOver the past 3 years, since graduating he managed to hold one job helping a local business, but the hours were at most 10-12 hours a week, before he eventually quit sometime early last year due to a bad environment and boss.\n\nHe still doesn’t have his license, and the area we grew up in has absolutely zero public transit. He hasn’t had a job since, and I  brought it up finally last November that I need him to work towards something instead of sitting at home all day and playing video games/watching tv/smoking weed. (I have had my phases of being a stoner too, to be honest and fair, but it hasn’t impacted my grades or work ethic).\n\nHe reacted harshly to that, and felt attacked, though I admit I could have phrased some things better. I keep bringing it up occasionally, finally pushed him to go to therapy his family could work with (community services, group counseling, which isn’t the most ideal) but he still barely applies to jobs or puts more effort into learning to drive. I know he is depressed and has mental health struggles. I want to be there for him and help but I just feel this huge imbalance in our relationship as we have transitioned out of teenagehood into adulthood.\n\nI brought it up again recently, and he gets upset and says I cannot understand because  I have always had all of my needs met, I didn’t grow up in his family or lack of support, and I agree I don’t understand, but it’s not an excuse to not do more of what you can. It’s been months since I first brought it up and there’s still been no greater progress.\n\nSome of my friends who know us both well suggest I try to wait it out, and hope he gets it together eventually. I will say he’s very sweet and kind, and does a lot for me when we are together. These issues have just been getting louder to me and I am fearing it will not change. I no longer feel secure in our relationship.\n\nI apologize for the long post. If anyone has advice for me, I would love to hear it. Thank you internet strangers.\n\nTLDR - Fiest told my (21M) bf (20M) of 3 years last November I need him to start working towards something; job, license, etc. He has made no progress more than beginning group counseling in that time, and reacts harshly and shuts down when I bring it up again. Advice? (Even harsh advice)",

      "title": "Struggling a lot with a hot and cold friendship with someone who matters a lot to me (both 23M)",
      "content": "Hey,\n\nI'm having a hard time dealing with a hot and cold friendship with a former classmate I met a year ago. We're both 23M and the first time we met, there was an undeniable spark. We went on a few dates, we hooked up but he ended up making me understand that he didn't want anything serious to happen. We were classmates so obviously it made the dynamics a bit hard to navigate.\n\nIt hurt but I was okay with it after a few weeks, and we reconnected. We decided we wanted to be friends : we have a lot of common interests, similar values and it's clear we enjoy each other's company. And it quickly became a close friendship : we used to have lunch just the two of us at least one week, we sent each other messages every day for a whole month, we were very close. Over time, he introduced me to his group of friends : we went to nightclubs with only his best friend and I at least twice a month, he made me meet his childhood friends. Basically I felt included.\n\nI'm not going to lie, at the beginning I knew I had feelings for him, and I think I made it obvious even though it was in subtle ways. But since about 4 months ago, I can say confidently that I see him as a friend and that I don't want anything more to happen. It's a friendship that matters a lot to me, because I appreciate him for who he is despite his flaws that became evident over time, but also for everything he brings me. He's the most \"fun\" friend I have, and I need that at this point in my life. He's also the only gay friend I have, and I think that it adds a layer of complexity to this whole situation.\n\nThe issue is that he's very hot and cold, and he has acted like that for months. There's been multiple times when I thought the friendship was over, only for him to come back and invite me again after I messaged him. There's a very weird dynamic between us : he's always the one inviting me in real life, and I'm always the one initiating messages. We've never had a conversation about the dynamics of our friendship, and maybe that's the issue. When I text him, he will sometimes answer very quickly, and sometimes he will take 2 days to do so. When that happens, I can't help but think I'm too much, like I'm overtexting and that's why he pulls away.\n\nThis behavior has been more and more evident recently. He used to like all of my instagram stories, but he hasn't done so in the past two weeks. He hasn't wished me a happy birthday 3 weeks ago even though he knew when it was. He was distant the last time I saw him with his friends, even though the week before he acted like a close friend. He will keep the conversations going when I text him, but always in a dry way. Yet he continues to do things that prove I matter for him. He invited me to his birthday in his hometown with his two best friends. He implied that he misses the time when we used to text each other every day (back in October). He has introduced me to all of his close friends. He often gives me compliments (about my personnality, my outfits ...).\n\nSo I'm confused. And these days, I feel like a big part of my self-confidence is linked to his invitations and the attention he brings me. Which is unhealthy, I know, but I value this friendship a lot : he's the only friend I can do stuff like going to concerts or nightclubs. He's my only gay friend as well, and that matters a lot to me. I really think we could become almost best friends at this point, but it's like he's doing everything to make it impossible to happen.\n\nSo I don't know what to do anymore. Any advice ?\n\n**TL;DR : I'm having a very hard time dealing with a hot and cold friendship that started in a close way. But now I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. The friendship matters a lot to me and I don't want to lose it, but maybe I'm losing my self-respect by accepting his behavior.**",

He does show up for me when something big is happening, like the death of a loved one or when I am overwhelmed by exams. But we are still long distance, and because of our studies and life circumstances, this will be the case for at least another three years. Sometimes, connection feels so hard to reach.\n\nHe says he is not very romantic and doesn’t care much about small things, so the only thing he consistently does is send good morning texts. When I ask for little things that make me feel closer to him, like occasional voice memos because I miss his voice, he sends one that lasts ten seconds and complains because he says he hates doing it. When I ask for compliments, he brushes it off, saying that if he didn’t think I was attractive, he wouldn’t be dating me. Once, I sent him a photo after getting a haircut and all he said was, “It’s not bad.” I’ve told him before how much that hurts, but when I bring up these things, hoping to be understood, it often turns into a debate or I end up feeling guilty for being “too sensitive.”\n\nHe has told me directly that emotions are just something you control and move on from. That he doesn’t feel the need to talk about them, because he is an adult and just deals with them. He said he only engages with emotional conversations because I care, not because he gets it himself. He also said he feels like he is more emotionally mature than me because he can “just move on” from things without needing to talk or process them.\n\nThe hardest part is that this has become a pattern. I’ve communicated these needs more than once. We even had a long, honest conversation recently, and I thought we really got somewhere. He said he understood, said he would try harder, but not even a day later he did not do any of the 3 little things he had promised to do (I know change takes time, but really? Not a single one out of 3?). In that same conversation, he told me that I am number five on his list of priorities, after family, work, school, and fishing, which is his main hobby. I am not asking to be number one, but being told I rank below a hobby, one that already takes so much of his time and attention, really hurt. Especially because I try so hard to be there for him, even when it is inconvenient for me.\n\nWhen I shared how I felt, he said that this is just how it is right now, and that when we are in the same city or married someday, things will be different. But also said he wouldn’t make those sacrifices now because I could leave him and then he would be left with nothing, no friends or hobbies like last time. I understand that fear, but I also wonder, is it fair to ask me to wait for love that feels more present?\n\nI guess what I’m asking is… am I expecting too much? Is it okay to want more emotional effort? He says he loves me, and I love him too, but I’m starting to question if this is what a relationship should feel like. Thank you for reading this far. Any thoughts would really mean a lot.\n\n**TL;DR**: I (22F) love my boyfriend (26M), and we talk about a future together. But I’ve been feeling increasingly lonely and emotionally unsupported. He says emotions are something you just control, and I often feel dismissed or misunderstood when I try to connect. He promised to try harder after a recent talk but quickly went back to old patterns. Am I asking for too much, or is this something worth being concerned about?",

      "content": "TL;DR - parents have become disapproving of partner because of a break in working/studying despite it being only a few months. partner is still trying to support me anyway he can but parents are insistent on blocking out our relationship.\n\nI (21F) have been dating my partner (22m) for over a year now. It started wonderfully, and initially I thought I had my parents support in pursuing a relationship with him. He had a full time job, is looking into studying in a medical field, and we both have the same ideals and values with one another and he quite literally makes me feel on top of the world whenever I’m with him.\n\nAfter a few months of dating, he had left his full time job to pursue his studying, but had to defer due to being sick and missing out on a good portion of his coursework. Since then, he’s been looking into finding a job to get that stability back before going back to his studies but has had no luck as of yet. In this time, we’ve still been going out on dates where sometimes I pay and sometimes he does too despite being out of work. We’ve decided to just take our time with things, and it’s been great because we know where we are at in our lives. I should emphasise I don’t feel as though I’m being inhibited at all as my own job is enough to get me by. I’m willing to support him, but he’s insisted on doing things on his own in order for me to achieve my own goals.\n\nMy parents, however, have taken a complete turn on the relationship where they now continuously make comments about my relationship and him being out of work and not currently studying. I’ve repeatedly explained to them the situation he’s in as he truly has been trying to get back up on he’s feet, but it’s just taking a bit more time than we both initially had thought.\n\nI don’t doubt the relationship whatsoever and he makes me so very happy. We don’t live together just yet and both live at home still, so that has made things easier when it comes to saving and getting by financially in the meantime. We still both want to get a stable career and income before moving in!\n\nBut now it has gotten to the point where they don’t even ask about him anymore, and whenever I bring up seeing him my parents become so tense or make another comment that just brings me down. I feel so anxious trying to navigate my relationship around them that it feels like if I try to say something it’ll turn into an argument. They’ve begun doing weird things by trying to put up a curfew whenever we’re going out to have dinner or just hangout, and even try making comments about how other men would be “perfect” for me because of their status and wealth.\n\nI genuinely see a future with my partner, and it’s frustrating that my parents haven’t even given him a chance or vested much interested in it the moment there’s been a setback out of our control. They don’t seem to understand that we are taking our time and know where we ourselves are at in the relationship.\n\nHow do I make them see eye to eye with me? And if I can’t, how do I move forward with their disapproval and judgement?",

Fast forward to our relationship, we have broken up 4 or 5 times now because of how much he still loves his ex even though we also love each other deeply. He is the love of my life, I see us one day getting married and having kids, but lastnight he told me that he may never want to do those things with me because he is scared he may always feel like his life was meant to be spent with someone else. He has tried to get her back every time we've broken up, however she has had a firm response of no every single time, even telling him to please focus his energy and attention on me because she has moved on.\n\nI really dont know what to do here. I love him more than I know how to put into words but there's only so many times a girl can hear that their partner may never love them more than their ex and that he believes she is his soul mate and that he never should of left.

      "title": "I feel like I’m losing myself in my relationship is it time to leave?",
      "content": " I (26F) am considering breaking up with my boyfriend (25M). I no longer feel like myself in this relationship.\n\nWe’ve been together for two and a half years now and when we first got together, our relationship felt incredibly healthy. There was patience, understanding, and space for both of us to express ourselves freely. I felt seen, safe, and supported. But over time, things have taken a serious turn for the worse, and I’m starting to feel lost and emotionally drained.\n\nNow, I can’t bring up concerns or issues without him becoming defensive. Every time I try to talk about something that’s bothering me, he takes it personally, projects things onto me, or shuts down. I’ve gotten to the point where I dread communicating any discomfort because more often than not, it leads to an argument or him withdrawing emotionally, and I’m left constantly asking him to respond to what I’m saying.\n\nSomething important to note: he has diagnosed ADHD, and I suspect I may have undiagnosed ADHD myself. Early on, I really struggled to understand how his ADHD showed up in our relationship; it was a major point of contention between us. But over time, I made a conscious effort to listen more, do research, and try to meet him where he’s at. I adjusted how I communicate, gave him grace, and tried to build systems that could work for both of us.\nDespite that, I’ve struggled to trust that he’ll follow through on the things he says he’ll do. Too many times I’ve been disappointed, let down, or left picking up the pieces. I’ve developed serious anxiety around this, constantly checking in, reminding him of tasks, and asking for updates because if I don’t, things often fall through the cracks. He tends to say he got distracted and blames his ADHD, and while I want to be understanding, I also don’t know where the line is between symptoms and excuses anymore.\nWe recently started a business together, and it’s only amplified the imbalance. I feel like I’m doing 90% of the work. He lacks initiative and rarely follows through without me prompting him, and I’ve grown so resentful and feel annoyed by him. I feel like his boss, not his partner.\n\nRecently, his friend came over to hang out. I was in crunch mode preparing for an upcoming business event, so I participated in the conversation when I could, but most of my focus was on work. His friend eventually started doing some of his own work, and suddenly, my boyfriend started working too, which struck me as performative. It felt like he was only doing it to appear productive in front of his friend, not because he actually wanted to contribute. What hurt most was that behind closed doors, I’ve been the one doing the majority of the heavy lifting, and here he was acting like an equal partner.\n\nThen he started discussing our business and finances in front of his friend, which really upset me. I’ve made it very clear from the beginning that I’m a private person, and I don’t like discussing our work or money with others. We had agreed on this boundary together, and he’s crossed it multiple times. I don’t like feeling like I’m bragging or oversharing personal details, and he knows this. I brought both concerns up to him later. He agreed he wouldn’t discuss our business in front of others again, but he completely invalidated my feelings about him suddenly working in front of his friend. It felt like another example of him only showing up when someone’s watching, and then minimizing my experience when I bring it up.\n\nThis pattern shows up in so many areas. Even Valentine’s Day, I had to ask him when he was planning to ask me to be his valentine (something I had previously communicated would make me feel loved). He then proceeded to do nothing for me on the day itself and when i asked why, he said “we never discussed that we would get each other gifts this year” like????? A few days ago, he wrote a letter, and yesterday he got me flowers (something he did frequently but hadn’t in a long time) but I felt numb. I didn’t believe the words in the letter. I didn’t feel anything, just indifference. And that scares me.\n\nWe’ve tried to “work on things” multiple times. A few months ago, I told him I wanted to break up, and I meant it. Then we decided to give it another shot. Two weeks later, he said he was checking out and maybe we should end it. Again, we decided to work on it. A month later, we had such an intense argument that I had a panic attack and told him I was done. But I stayed. We recently started therapy, and while he listens during sessions, the effort never lasts more than a couple of days.\n\nAt this point, I feel like I’m dragging him through life. I’ve become someone I don’t recognize, constantly in survival mode, angry, irritated, and exhausted. I used to be soft and light. Now I feel like a nag, a manager, a caretaker. I love his family and his friends, and saying goodbye to the life we built is terrifying. But staying has started to feel even scarier.\n\nAnother thing that has become increasingly difficult is his emotional reactions. He’s become much less patient, and I’ve noticed that his reactions to small things have become big and aggressive. One of the reasons I fell for him initially was because of how calm and collected he was. I never thought I’d be in a situation where I felt unsafe because of his behavior. But now, there are moments where I feel like I'm constantly in fight or flight mode because of how he reacts to things.\n\nFor example, if he gets a scratch on his finger, he’ll scream “F***!” and start freaking out, and I’m left thinking, “It’s a little cut, why are you acting like this?” Or if something external happens, like he gets cut off while driving, he can’t regulate himself at all. Or I could leave the room for like two second to grab a glass of water or something, and when I come back, he’s in a completely different mood because of something negative that happened while i was gone. Now, I’m suddenly walking on eggshells because I feel unsafe. He’s never been physically violent or directed anger at me, but the emotional intensity makes the atmosphere feel tense and volatile. I don’t know how to feel calm or safe when I’m constantly adjusting to his unpredictable moods.\n\nI thought this was the person I would spend the rest of my life with. I just miss my sweet boy and wish we could go back to when things weren’t like this  \n\nHas anyone experienced something like this? How do you know when it’s truly time to leave? I’ve stayed hoping things would get better, but I’m miserable. I want to feel like me again.\n\n\nTL;DR:\nMy relationship started off healthy and supportive, but over time it’s become draining and unbalanced. My boyfriend has ADHD (diagnosed), and while I’ve worked hard to support him, I feel like I’m constantly managing him and our life. Communication has broken down, I don’t feel emotionally safe, and I’m always walking on eggshells due to his mood swings. We run a business together, but I do most of the work and feel more like his boss than his partner. I’ve tried to leave before but stayed out of hope. Now, I feel numb, resentful, and like I’ve lost myself. How do you know when it’s really time to walk away?\n",

      "content": "We’ve been together coming up 4 years.\n\nWhenever my family has disagreements, there’s never any voice raising or anger. My family tends to disperse into our own areas and then come back whenever the emotions are lower. In bad “fights” it mainly just feels like you have to walk quietly around the house to not disturb anyone else-with passive aggressiveness sprinkled here and there. But the last time my family had an actual fight was probably 5 years ago.\n\nMy partners family is the opposite. Raised voices are virtually an every day occurrence. Even whenever there’s not a disagreement, there’s still raised voices and chaos. Screaming fights are I’d say weekly.\n\nIt’s never been a problem until recently- we were long distance for the first year and then for two years, she moved in with me and we lived near my family. Last year I got a job across the country and she decided it would be better financially to live back with her family while I live 40 minutes away in my own apartment. \n\nThe most interaction I used to have with her family was around a one week period at most. Now, I see them weekly when I make the drive to see her (I have a car, she doesn’t). She also got a second job, so she used to be able to come over more often to mine, but within the past 3 weeks it’s been me driving to hers.\n\nI’ve realized that her family makes me anxious. Even when tension isn’t high, I find myself subconsciously stressed out wondering when there’s going to be another fight.\n\nYesterday I was at her place and we were watching tv, and her family came home and casually sat down and watched tv with us. I didn’t realize this til after I left, but my anxiety shot up and I couldn’t sit still once they came back home. I’m always trying to get us to go out and about when her family is home so that I don’t have to worry about that.\n\nShe noticed that I was antsy and got upset with me and assumed that I was anxious because we were sitting around doing nothing. It was only later that I put two and two together. I tried explaining to her bluntly that her family makes me anxious, but she took offense to it and defended their actions and said they have done nothing wrong. She says it’s fine and that’s “just how they talk, it doesn’t mean that they’re mad at each other”.\nIt’s gotten to the point though where I feel a wave of dread driving to her place because I know there’s going to be some issue that her family causes. How can I explain to her that it’s becoming a genuinely bad problem?\n\nTL;DR:\nI come from a reserved calmer family- and my partner does not. Verbal arguments are a constant issue. Wasn’t a problem for me until she moved back in with her parents to save money. Now, with me being the one with a car, I see them weekly and have realized that they’re causing me a lot of stress. I tried telling her bluntly that her family makes me stressed out, but she took offense to it and doesn’t seem to see my point of view. How can I explain it to her, especially since this is all she knows?",

      "content": "\nI (20M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (20F) for more than a year, and we truly care about each other. We’re in a long-distance relationship during the week because of university, but we see each other on weekends and are emotionally close.\n\nLately, I’ve been feeling a little off due to something I noticed. There’s this one guy she chats with online—nothing explicitly wrong from what I can tell, but I can’t shake the feeling that she hides that interaction when I’m around. For example, she won’t open his messages in front of me or skips them quickly. She’s open with most of her chats, except this one. She just once said that he texted her because of her art profile. Yesterday i saw that he reacted with 😍 to the story of her new personal post and she replied with 🤍🤍🤍that triggers a little jealousy and insecurity in me, especially because I don’t have a big social circle outside of her.\n\nI haven’t confronted her about it yet, because I don’t want to seem controlling or toxic. She had a traumatic relationship before, and I’m doing my best not to repeat that kind of pressure. But at the same time, I’m wondering if I’m ignoring a potential red flag.\n\nShe shows she loves me: sends memes, checks in with how I’m feeling, apologizes when she overreacts. So this might just be me overthinking, We hug and kiss and spend quality time together.\n\nDo you think I should bring it up and how? Or am I being overly insecure?\n\nTLDR:My girlfriend (20F) and I (20M) are in a loving long-distance relationship. Recently, I noticed she’s a bit secretive about chatting with one particular guy (a tattoo artist she’s never met). She reacts normally to most messages, but hides his. It makes me feel uneasy and a bit jealous, especially since I don’t have many social connections outside of her. I don’t want to come off as controlling, but I’m unsure if I’m being insecure or if I should calmly bring it up. Any advice?",

      "content": "TL;DR -> My girlfriend(34) and I(29) together for \\~5 months have been fighting for the last two weeks due to exes and family issues. We almost broke off once because we thought we were not compatible, but we decided to try again. I am looking for advice on how to approach the situation better and get my relationship back on track. My outcome is for us to get our relationship back on track with minimum friction.  \nContext(reposting again since the last one got deleted due to missing TL; DR)—We met last December at an event, decided to talk, and went on a date in early January. The first date felt terrific, and things were going quite well, so we started an exclusive relationship in February.\n\nWe talked about our past relationships and our families. We had fights a couple of times, but nothing out of the ordinary. We have a long distance, so we meet and go on vacation every week in Asia. Since both of us earn good money, we are able to meet every month.\n\nIssues started mid-month when we began discussing marriage, like introducing families. She doesn‘t want me to meet her family because they might not like me and she doesn't have a good relationship with them. I didn’t push for it, since I respected her decision. I want her to meet my family, but the issue is that this topic becomes quite touchy. Somehow, it feels like a task that must be done for her, like she would ask how many times she needs to meet, how many times she needs to call them, etc. Family is important to me, and she’s my priority, too, so I want to make sure we feel comfortable with each other. But I feel like im maybe forcing her to meet my family? The issue is we discussed engagement and marriage, and I can't get married without introducing her to my family. But somehow I get questions like, if some argument happens, who would you choose? I told her I would choose her, and then we could discuss what we could have. But the question that bothers me is when she asked who I would choose if my mom asked me to choose between my mom and her. I argue that she will be part of the family, so we don’t choose one over another. If there is conflict we solve it. But this is a significant reason for fights almost every other day. Then her ex messages her, which I am not comfortable with. She asked her ex why he gave up on her, and his reply upset her because somehow his mother told him not to leave his wife for her. I was upset why she asked this question, etc, but she got upset that I would do the same. I do bring up the topic of exes constantly, maybe I shouldn’t, but I get insecure somehow, perhaps it's because of my past relationship, where I got cheated on.\n\nAnother source of the fight is that we planned to have a vacation with my family, but it didn’t go according to plan because of location changes. Still, I said I am sorry for the mess with booking etc but she called them fucking morons, I get she’s angry but i don’t get why name calling. So, I cancelled the trip and decided to get her on a call with my family a couple of times before introducing them f2f, so things are not too overwhelming for everyone.\n\nI do agree I have communication problem, for example if I know something is going to lead to a fight, I will still tell her because i don't want to hide anything, example on location change for visit for my family I kinda could have managed situation better, by just telling her one location.\n\nI sometimes don’t understand what I am doing wrong. Is there something I should do better to fix our relationship? I just don‘t want to end things because I love her a lot, and I promised to marry her(I do want to). But I also don’t want fights. So I want to know how I should approach the situation better",

This relationship has been the best I could’ve asked for — he loves me deeply, supports me, and I genuinely see a future with him.\n\nI don’t have a good relationship with my parents due to past abuse and left home at 17. I’ve lived with my grandparents since and support myself completely. Because of my past, yelling or conflict is very triggering to me.\n\nThe issue is with his family. I’ve never felt fully welcomed. His mom is hot and cold, and I had a draining experience working for her early in the relationship. I also don’t get along with his sister-in-law, and his mom has made comments that it’s my fault and I should “try harder.” I’ve always felt watched or judged, especially since I don’t have a stable family background.\n\nAbout four weeks ago, his dad screamed at me over not using a napkin, cursed at me, and basically kicked me out. It triggered me so badly I was shaking and crying. I haven’t been back to his house since. My boyfriend can’t come over due to my grandparents’ rules, so this has created a lot of emotional distance between us.\n\nWe’ve been talking for hours, crying in parking lots, trying to figure out how to move forward. I reached out to his mom to have a conversation. We met at a restaurant, and instead of listening to my feelings, she listed everything I’ve done wrong, said I can’t be treated like family since we’re not married, and questioned our relationship. I felt dismissed and blamed.\n\nNow, she’s “okay” with me coming over again — but only once a week, only in their basement, and I must leave by 11 PM. I’m hurt and confused. I love my boyfriend so much and know he loves me too, but I’m not sure how to keep this going when I feel so unwelcome and emotionally drained by his family. I just scheduled an appointment with my therapist to start unpacking everything.\n\nHas anyone been in a situation like this? How do I balance protecting myself while holding onto a relationship that means the world to me?\n\ntldr? basically his family and i don’t get along and they have made me feel like i don’t belong there and seem like they’re itching for my boyfriend and i to break up.

      "content": "I’m a woman in my mid-20s, dating a man in his early 30s. His sister is in her mid-30s. A few months ago, she and I had a fallout — we’d grown close over the past year. At a family event, she raised her voice at me (which is a trigger for me), and I shut down. When she asked if I was ignoring her, I said yes, which upset her more. I tried to apologize privately (knowing she doesn’t like being ignored), but the conversation didn’t go well. She said she wasn’t raising her voice, and I felt talked over and dismissed.\n\nLater that night, she brought it up again and said she was sorry “for how I felt,” but I felt small and a bit cornered. I apologized for my part and didn’t really want to revisit it again. I pulled back for a while, overwhelmed with the situation and life in general. She eventually called, and we had a full conversation where we both apologized and moved on. Since then, she hasn’t brought anything up again, and we’ve been able to hang out (sometimes a little awkward, but good overall). We went from talking daily to only when we see each other, which honestly feels more comfortable and less emotionally loaded for me. For background, I don’t have much closeee friends. \n\nThe problem is, my boyfriend has made comments about how I “cut people off easily.” I haven’t fully shared how I felt during all of that, partly because I didn’t want to put him in the middle or risk creating a wedge between him and his sister. That’s the last thing I want. But he’s been making little comments or questions (which I think come from a good place) like, “Do you not want to go because she’ll be there?” — even though I’ve moved on and haven’t said anything about her.\n\nI brought it up with my bf and asked how he felt and if this had an effect on our relationship and he basically said no. I know his sister has brought it up with him since then but he doesn’t talk about it and honestly, I don’t ask. Now I’m wondering, should I also check in with her again just to clear the air one more time — even though we already hashed it out and she hasn’t brought anything else up to me?\n\nI don’t want to reopen old wounds, but I also don’t want to let silence create assumptions.\n\nTL;DR:\nI (mid-20s F) had a fallout with my BF’s (early 30s M) sister (mid-30s F). We talked and made peace, and she hasn’t brought up anything since. I’ve kept a bit of distance, which feels better for me. But my BF thinks I’m avoiding her and keeps making small comments. I didn’t explain everything to him to avoid causing tension between them. Should I talk to him about it again? Or her too — just to make sure nothing’s lingering?",

      "content": "My boyfriend got out of a long-term, live-in relationship only about two months before we started seeing each other. From the start, he told me he hadn’t fully processed the breakup and didn’t want anything serious yet. I told him I was okay with that because I’d liked him for so long and was afraid of losing the chance to be with him.\n\nWe made things official after a month, and right after that, summer break started and we became long-distance. Since then, he hasn’t messaged me much and been distant (he said he’s really busy and warned me he’s not good at long distance) and spending a lot of time with a close female friend he used to have mutual romantic feelings for. I told him how I felt about this and he said I didn’t need to worry and they’re just friends now, but they moved out to our college town together and are practically inseparable. It makes me feel incredibly insecure.\n\nThe relationship is still new (we haven’t even said “I love you” yet), and I’m scared to be honest about how unhappy I feel. I promised I wouldn’t pressure him or ask for too much, but I’m in agony. Even though we’re technically together, I still feel like I’m chasing after him — like I’m constantly worried he’ll leave me for someone else.\n\nI don’t know if I’m being irrational, self-sabotaging, or if my gut is trying to warn me. I have a history of being cheated on and struggle with CPTSD and bipolar disorder, so I don’t fully trust my judgment. I don’t want to ruin this relationship, but I also don’t know if it’s already slipping away and I should just let go before I get hurt again.\nWhat should I do? I adore the guy and I’m serious about wanting to be with him, but I’m afraid that the situation is doomed and inevitably going to end with him hurting me.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend started dating me shortly after a long-term breakup. We became official then went long-distance, and now he’s emotionally distant and very close to a girl he used to like. I feel insecure, scared, and unsure whether I’m overreacting or if the relationship is already falling apart. I need advice: is it salvageable or am I just prolonging heartbreak?",

      "content": "Hey guys, I really need help and just need to talk to people. I have social anxiety disorder and not really any friends so you are my last resort. My wife F32 and I M33 we are both in our early 30s, married for 3 and together for more than 5 years. I moved to the city she lived many years ago and recently started my dream job right here.\n\nCurrently she is visiting her family in her home country for two weeks (she can work remote from there). Yesterday we had a phone talk which ended in a huge fight. She proposed an idea about a trip (we are both avid travelers). However, this once again involved her mom. The plan suggested her mom visits us and then the three of us go somewhere for two days on the weekend and then I go home (I am still on my trial period and cannot get any vacation obviously) and then she and her mother will continue that. I did not really like that plan. I love travelling alone or with my wife, but not with my mother-in-law. She has no money and everything is paid for her. Meanwhile, we are low on money ourselves. There is a language barrier (I am learning my wife’s native language but I’m still at intermediate level) and for me it’s not a holiday but rather exhausting every time. We talked about this many times before. Bear in mind, we already took trips with my wife and my mother-in-law together this year (one week and four days on another occasion). My wife also spent another week with my mother-in-law at another place and I stayed at home, they have another week-long trip coming up and we planned to spend the Christmas holidays and her family’s. I actually spent more time with her mother-in-law than with my own family.\n\nAs this is a controversial topic, I tried to avoid it. But she kept pushing me to say why I do not like her travel idea. I said ok I can tell you but you have to promise me not to get mad, to which she agreed. I told her that I don’t really like to travel with her mom because for me it’s just exhausting. I told her this many times before. My wife then completely exploded. She said I cannot disrespect her family like this. Her family was there first and I came afterwards. If she had to decide between me and her mother, her mother will always come first. She said I am not part of the family anymore and she wants a divorce. For context, I can’t really take this seriously because she said this like fifty to a hundred times before, i.e. every time we had a fight respectively every time I disagreed on something or asserted another opinion.\nPlus, every time we have a fight I like to discuss it or find a compromise. She, however, prefers the silent treatment. If I bring up some (in my opinion) valid points, she always says she does not want to talk anymore and goes stonewalling. She also never apologises afterwards. I also asked her what about promising that she won’t get mad if I raise my opinion. She said „I changed my mind now.“\n\nNow as a result of this fight she blocked me on WhatsApp (this she already did many, many times). As she is in another country, I have no way of physically reaching out to her and don’t know if she will communicate with me again tomorrow or in two weeks, who knows.\n\nI am having a panic attack. This conflict is unresolved, I am all alone, I should focus on my job but my heart is racing like crazy. Please advice.\n\ntl;dr Wife goes stonewalling after a fight since I disagreed with her and I don’t know how to handle this.",

What to do? I know he's open to advice and to criticism, but obviously he's living this way for a while so it doesn't bug him. It bugs ME but I don't want to start cleaning for him (maybe we can clean together?) but I also have NO IDEA where to start. Should I maybe offer some proffesional help, just to get his place to baseline? Do I need to offer to pay for the Proffesional help? Should I make a list of ckeaning supplies I can't find so we can start?

He avoids her if he can and uses short sentences to respond to her. It is awkward. This is pretty much my fault since when we started dating 7 years ago, I told him a lot of bad stuff about my parents. My dad wasn't around (he had remarried) and my mother raised us. She's gotten depressed and was depressed and overwhelmed part of the time we were being raised. If I was late getting up in the morning she would yell and scream because she had to get to work. I dropped out of college and she gave me a hard time because of the money SHE had spent on it. I never thought she didn't love me but her anxiety is a lot. And her personality is big and she talks a lot. Sometimes I feel annoyed and embarrassed by her. My brother and sister don't mind this but it drives me nuts. My boyfriend now husband knew all this and just doesn't like her and isn't discrete about it.\n\n  \nWe moved far from her 4 years ago but for jobs, not to get away from anyone. I have not flown home  per se but met up with her when my husband wanted to see his parents and we stayed with them. She has come here twice. I don't know why I was so annoyed by her the first time, but I was. She could tell I did not want her around and she was pressing me about why and we started arguing. My husband (lhe was my bf then) came in and screamed at her for upsetting me and told her she wasn't welcome. She left the house and I figured she was going somewhere to cool off or get something to eat but she flew home! That freaked me out pretty bad. I thought that was pretty dramatic and so did he and just added to his view of her personality. When we got married, my husband didn't want her involved with our wedding and had his mother do most of the planning. I know that upset my mother. She gave $10,000 and so did my dad. And she came to the wedding, which was near her home anyway. She came to visit us again a few months later and I really tried  my best not to be impatient or annoyed. But my husband hates her and didn't change his behavior and she was really hurt. She stayed the full time but after she got home she said she couldn't come to visit anymore, that it was too painful. Then my brother got mad about how my husband acted and told her that I had told my husband stories about her which is why he doesn't like her and she got super upset. She wanted to go to therapy with me over the phone because she didn't even know what I had told him but I didn't want to pursue it. I thought she should just let it go. Starting then she has barely called me and she usually initiated the calls. When I call she keeps it pretty brief now.\n\n  \nWe are buying a house and are going to try for a baby next. I want to try to fix this with my mom. I told her I would like to have her come see the house but she told me she is not coming anymore. I spoke to my husband and he said he will tone it down. She basically said that whatever it was I said has made it so she can't face him or his family and that she will not be coming anymore and she is accepting of this. She says I seem to be happy with him and that is what she wants for me but that she will not be treated poorly by people not even her own daughter. She began crying and excused herself and hung up. My husband is fine with this but I am not. I want to try to fix this and if anyone has any ideas on how to start rebuilding with my mother I will listen. FWIW my brother and sister are pretty upset with me but I am not that close to them either. Their personalities are more like my mother which is louder and more in your face. They have both been out to see us here and it was not dramatic.\n\n  \nTL;DR Want to fix relationship with my mother who lives far away. She doesn't want to come here anymore because my husband does not like her.",

There was a girl at work that I met (F 20) that I started to become close with. We started to confide in each other and basically, bond over stressors in our own relationships. Instead of telling my partner, I told this other female things I should’ve communicated with my partner. I would even meet up with this girl to talk about things after work and not tell my person. \nNothing physical EVER happened, nor did I want it to. My partner started to catch onto this girl and didn’t want me talking to her.  I may have emotionally tried to see if I could catch feelings for someone else other than my partner (which didn’t happen and made me realize I only want my partner) and told a friend how I’ve been feeling and she told my partner. My partner is mortified and I don’t blame her one bit. \nI feel horrible and I don’t want to lose her. The ring was getting closer to being here (I had it customized on Etsy) and I freaked out, literally self sabotaging and breaking her trust. I have trauma with marriage because of my parents and I know that’s why I did what I did. \n\nTL;DR;\n\nPlease give me advice. What can I do to fix things? Can things be fixed? ",

      "content": "So we've been dating for over a year and we've been living together for most of it (initially roommates).\n\nWe started off so strong, and she was so insanely into me. I've never vibed with another person so quickly - it really felt like we were made for each other.\n\nThings started to feel a little weird after maybe the first 5 months. She started to show a little anger problem, and would flip out at me over little things. Saying that, I can be annoying and clumsy and forgetful, so it might be warranted. Her passion is cooking, and she always wants me there to help her, but she's so insanely irritable while cooking, it can be downright depressing to be there. I love her, but she genuinely doesn't see a problem with her yelling. For example, I brought it up at some point and she made comparisons to me sometimes being quiet and said it's just as bad... Is it? On-top of this, she wants me to do soooo much for her. I love her and love to do so much for her but it's taking a toll. For example, I have to grab everything she wants throughout the day, and then I have to give her massages everyday (she has back and foot pain). But it can be insanely dehumanizing when I tell her my hand joints are hurting and she keeps pushing me to massage. A part of me worries that she thinks I'm obligated to do these things because she's working and I'm still studying (albeit a very intensive med course)\n\nAfter we we kissed for the first time, we were having sex daily for months. But for the last 5 months, sex has gone down to once a fortnight. Initially when frequency was dropping, I would ask if she wanted to, and she would start shutting me down, telling me that asking ruins the mood and puts pressure on her. So I avoid asking her almost all together out of fear of putting pressure on her and getting rejected. It's been about two weeks since we last had sex. Last night we were cuddling in bed, flirting a little bit, I made a move, then she quickly pushed my hand away. I find this soooo soul crushing. On one hand, I feel bad for touching her when she didn't want it. On the other hand, why doesn't my gf want to have sex with me? I love her so much, but I need sex so bad and it's reeeeally effecting my mood. I thought sex would get more frequent after she settled into her new ft job, but it's not. as bad as it sounds, I also selfishly think of her high body count (up to 40 men), and just wonder why she doesn't want me, while loving sex so much. And as stupid as it sounds, I feel like she's had so much more sex than me, and she might be bored of it now. Whereas, I have so much I want to try.\n\nAlso I feel like a complete ass, but damn I get quiet and distant when I'm rejected, and I just can't help it. So much goes through my mind when she rejects me and it genuinely sends me into a crazy depression. It sounds so selfish, but I can't help this. I've been looking into seeing a psychologist to talk about things like this.\n\nIs there a problem here or does this happen to most relationships eventually?\n\nTL;DR: Sex is dropping off between us, and I'm unsure if this just a normal progression of a relationship.",

      "content": "My girlfriend and I have had our biggest argument yet after nearly 3 years together, and it’s feeling quite final.\n\nThings have been rocky for a while, pretty much since the birth of our baby 4 months ago. I know this is a massive factor in both our stress levels and contributed to our argument, but I don’t know how we move forward.\n\nShe had become annoyed that I hadn’t done something I she wanted me to do. She hadn’t asked and it wasn’t something that we do usually, so I genuinely didn’t know she wanted it doing. It then escalated to how my technique to sooth the baby when he cried wasn’t effective, which I agree with. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t, but it isn’t for lack of trying.\n\nI got upset by this and walked off. We didn’t speak much for the rest of the day.\n\nThis evening we decided to talk and it turned into an argument.\n\nWe often have conversations and within 10 minutes she has no recollection of the conversation. I don’t feel heard, so I bought it up she laughed and said “I can’t help that” which did annoy me. This has been something that happened before baby. It’s like she switches off and goes on autopilot. Responding, but not actually listening to remember the conversation.\n\nShe said I’m always on my phone which on our time together, which annoys her.\n\nThis is usually when she is breastfeeding. I’ll go and sit next to her and we’ll watch something. It’s always something she has chosen and often something I have no interest in at all. We haven’t watched a single show or movie that’s my choice in the time we’ve been together.\n\nI said if we switched it up, and watched something she likes one day and me the next, or even what I wanna watch once a week or two weeks, I’d probably be more engaged.\n\nShe has said she only likes specific things, so that wouldn’t work.\n\nI get bored, so I do acknowledge I get my phone out a fair bit. I’ve put timers on my apps because she has mentioned it before so it has improved.\n\nShe said I should talk to her, but she is always uninterested when I make conversation. Some times I’ll get a closed ended response under 5 words, sometimes it’s like she doesn’t even hear me. Sometimes she forgets the conversation within minutes.\n\nI’ve given up trying to make conversation, so I do end up on my phone, so she has a point.\n\nThis led into her saying she feels unloved because I don’t hug, kiss or touch her anymore.\n\nEvery time I’ve tried to do this for the past three months, she’s pulled away from all 3 or made a comment like “get off” which I obviously do.\n\nLike the conversation thing, I’ve given up trying. I can’t keep trying to touch or kiss someone who has explicitly said she doesn’t want me to.\n\nThese were my reasons for what she said to me which I told her and she said “you always blame me” and she kept saying this as I tried to explain I wasn’t blaming her, I was just trying to explain why I hadn’t been affectionate and the phone thing, she just kept interrupting saying “yeah, all my fault” and things like that.\n\nI shouted and said “you’re not listening!” And she said I looked angry. I apologised immediately. I knew I shouldn’t have communicated it like that. In my head it was pure frustration. There was zero excuse for me to shout.\n\nI genuinely don’t what to blame anyone, I was just trying to say that’s why I’m doing what I’m doing, but she takes it as an attack.\n\nI can see how it looks like blame, but it’s hard keep making conversation when someone’s  like “umm” “that’s good” “yeah” or doesn’t acknowledge you talking at all.\n\nShe confirmed today that she doesn’t want to be touched, which I get; she’s just had a baby and not confident in her body, I just think it’s odd to call me out on not touching her when I’ve tried to loads.\n\nI’ve tried complimenting her and she’ll scoff or try and embarrass me for doing it.\n\nI feel like I can’t win.\n\nAs a side note, as I know this could be a thing, I do all the house work and cooking as she is the primary care giver to baby as she’s breastfeeding. and take care of baby as much as I can.\n\nI offer her free time and she doesn’t even respond to me. It’s like she hasn’t heard me.\n\nHow do we move forward?\n\nTl;dr My (35M) Girlfriend (34F) had a massive argument over things that seem contradictory. How do we move forward?\n\n",

I've had a problem before with a female co worker that he had a \"thing\" with before we were together and found texts in his phone a good few months back now of flirty messages.(in different language so I translated the best I could) The messages are definitely more than friendly but I never had the balls to actually confront him because he has flipped it that I was looking at his phone in the past. So that's been in the back of my head for a long time now. That aside, in the past few months I just feel differently. (I had surgery and since then I've not been getting stoned. This was something that we did almost daily for basically our whole relationship.) Its like since im sober all the time now there's so many things that bother me about him that I guess I didn't notice before?? I also feel like i avoid getting intimate with him because im just not interested right now, the thought of being touched just erks me..  I dont know if that will change. His views and opinions are very different to mine and its becoming a lot clearer now that im sober all the time. I want to at least try and start some kind of conversation with him about this to give it some type of chance but he stone walls really quickly and probably won't really listen to me. I also live him with him which makes things feel harder.. \nI turn 30 this year and want to make sure I'm going in a direction that I'm happy with. Any advice?? Pleaasse\n\nTL;DR: I'm (29F) in a 9-year relationship with my boyfriend (33M), but things feel off lately. I found flirty messages to a female coworker he used to have a \"thing\" with — definitely more than friendly. I recently had surgery and stopped smoking weed (which we used to do daily), and now that I’m sober, I’m noticing a lot more issues in our relationship — we have different views, I avoid intimacy, and I just feel disconnected. I still live with him, which complicates things, but I’m turning 30 this year and want to move in a direction that makes me happy.\nHow do I even begin a conversation with someone who stonewalls everything? Any advice? 🙃",

We’re not in a relationship — not really. It’s more of a situationship. One of those in-between things where there’s just enough emotion to keep you tangled, but not enough commitment to feel secure.\n\nWhenever I try to pull away, stop answering his calls, or create some distance, he shows up. Literally. He comes to my door, says the right things, finds his way back in — and I let him. It’s like I can’t break the cycle.\n\nHe hasn’t contacted me in four days. And today, I saw him with another girl. That moment hit something deep in me — a familiar feeling of being not enough.\n\nWe once talked about being exclusive. It ended with him pulling back, giving me even less of his attention. When I brought it up, he told me I needed to go at his pace. That he’s too stressed with life already, and my expectations just add to that pressure.\n\nBut the truth is… he only calls when he’s bored. Or when he’s emotionally drained and needs someone to pick him up. Meanwhile, he’s free to be with other girls — and I’m the one left sitting here, stressing, questioning my worth.\n\nWhat hurts the most is knowing this dynamic isn’t right. I know I’m being used. I know I’m always the second choice. And yet, I can’t seem to let him go. That’s the part that breaks me the most.\n\nThere’s so much wrong in this ‘almost-relationship,’ and still, I feel stuck. Sad. Hollow. And somehow still hoping for something that I know deep down will never feel safe or real.",

Unsure how to handle it \n\nMe and my partner have been together for a bit \nover 2 years now. She's the most amazing partner , she's someone I feel safe and completely comfortable around and I love her dearly. She makes me feel seen and happy, but there's one thing that's slowly building up in me.\n\nFor some context here, my partner is on the autism spectrum, she has a condition making sex in most positions painful and she has also had some bad experiences regarding sex prior to us getting together. This, atleast i believe, has made her in general not have much of a sex drive. Taking initiative regarding sex, or even getting horny in general is not something that happens for her unless I take an active role.\nThings like sexting, receiving or sending  sexual images or videos make her feel uncomfortable in general.\n\nI, however, have a fairly active sex drive. I'm someone who wants to try, experiment and experience many different parts of sex. I love teasing, I love sexting and everything included. \n\nThis has caused a lot of frustration to build up within myself regarding our sex life. We've had conversations about this before, where we've had good discussions on what we should do so we both feel comfortable but it doesn't feel like anything is actually happening.\n\nNo'one of this is her fault, I don't blame her in the slightest. She has no control over her sex drive or her body in that sense and I don't push her in any way out of respect for this. I'm also just in general concerned for her well being.\n\nSo I'm not sure what to do honestly. I love her incredibly, she's someone I could spend the rest of my life with. But this frustration building up regarding our sex life is aggrevating.\n\nIf anyone else with experiences like this has any advice for how my partner and I could handle this together I'd truly appreciate it.",

      "content": "  \nSo, we've been together for about 4 years now. She's 21F, and i'm 23M. Throughout those four years, we've had a lot of struggles inour relationship. Mostly because of how I handle problems when they come up.\n\nBefore I met her, I had never dated anyone, and the same goes for her. Until we met, I never really developed the ability to handle or resolve problems in a healthy way. I come from a very dysfunctional family where no one ever really cared about emotions. I've never heard anyone in my family apologize after an argument or try to resolve things in a mature way.\n\nThe way I learned to deal with problems growing up was just to ignore them. I wouldn’t try to find solutions. I’d distract myself with anything to get my mind off it. And I think that shaped me into someone who never learned how to work through conflict with another person.\n\nAnd that's exactly where problems appear on the relationship. My girlfriend is that kind of person who really like things to be clear and solved, she just doesn't get peace until things are solved.\n\nAnd i do like things to be solved aswell, but as i said before, the way i learned to deal with problems was simply to get myself some space and let the sadness or whatever disappear. This way i become someone who don't save regrets in most cases. Mostly trying not to blame anyone for the problem and stuff like that.\n\nSo, along those four years, she was all the time the active person on trying to solve things. I was never the person who tries to talk about the problems and bring solutions for it. And obviously, after several years of being the only person doing that, she got tired. I was really immature, made a bunch of promises of changes in that field and never fulfilled them.\n\nShe doesn't believe anymore when i say i'll change those things, and honestly, not even i trust in my word about that anymore. She started thinking that those changes never happened because i was never interested in changing, but that's really not the case. I love her in a way that i never felt for anyone else. As i said, she's my first girlfriend, so, i never dated anyone before. I would even say that i found out what love is after i met her. Most of my concerns are on doing things that will make her happier, safer and specially confident about herself and confident on me as a partner.\n\nI always wanted to be a good boyfriend and later a good husband. But nowadays, i'm scared of not even become her husband.\n\nMost of the time, when something happens, i get kinda scared of talking about it. Won't save words: i got scared of where that conversation can go, since it can be end up with a break up.\n\nAnd not only that, i do get anxious to talk about problems without having a clear solution about them. I do know that solutions and solving's are not supposed to be dealt by one person only, since the relationship it's not made by only one person.\n\nAll the time i got that feeling that if i don't do everything right, things are going to be ruined.\n\nI'm not a closed person, who doesn't like to talk, but when the talk is about problems, it's like a become another version of myself. Unconfident on me, what i do and what i can do.\n\nHow can i handle those things? i'm considering therapy in the next days, but i know that therapy might take sometime so i can learn more about myself and stuff.\n\n  \n**TL;DR:**  \nNever learned how to deal with conflict, and it’s hurting my 4-year relationship. My girlfriend’s exhausted from always being the one fixing things. I love her and want to change, but I’m scared it’s too late.",

      "content": "I am in a loving relationship with my girlfriend, but we have some issues that could spell the end of it. I need some input from you guys.\n\nI will try to keep this short.\n\nWe met about 2 years ago, and hooked up at the end of our schooling together. After 6 months of being sexually active we decided to enter a comitted relationship. We have been officialy together for a year now. Half of that time has been long distance, and it will stay that way for at least 5 years.\n\nShe is my first girlfriend by choice, and I picked the right person for it. I could go on for ages when talking about everything that endears her to me.\n\nShe has had a tough life so far. Abuse parent and a horrible ex she stayed with for 6 years because she belived nobody else would be with her. She strugles with major self esteem problems, and has been hurt deeply.\n\nSeveral times now, she has expressed that she does not think she can love me the way I love her. I love her with a passion, but her love is aparently a calm relaxed one. To her, it feels like we skipped the «falling in love» stage, and went straight to being in love. She feels so secure in my love for her that there is little excitement.\n\nOur relationship moved very quickly. There was little courtship, we basically jumped straigth from classmates with attraction to a safe and secure relationship.\n\nWe had a talk recently where we discussed if we should stay together or not.\n\nWe dont know if what she wants is me, or the fact that I heal her soul by loving her this way. She is afraid of losing me, but we dont know if we can give eachother what we need.\n\nI want to be with her, and she wants to be with me. But these issues is taking a toll on the relationship.\n\nI think she could be the one for me. I can see myself growing old with her. I am afraid that if I break it off, I would regret it for the rest of my life.\n\nBut at the same time, I have needs that are not being met. Is it fair to myself to stay? After all, we have 5 years of long distance. I have needs that could be met by someone else.\n\nI just dont know what I should do.\n\n  \ntl;dr there seems to be an imballance in the way I and my girlfriend loves eachother, but we dont know if it is unhealthy or not. I would like some outside perspective from people who are more experienced with healthy sustainable relationships.",

      "content": "The story is that we were best friends who became lovers. We dated for about 6 months until one day, an ex of mine came up with screenshots from her anonymous messages app in which someone was claiming to be me and sending her texts about missing her. Couple this in with a conversation during that time (I was unaware of the anonymous messages) on facebook where I told her that I wasn't happy with life and that I was having some issues, she took the screenshots of both my messages and her anonymous messages, twisted it around painting me in a way that I was referring to not being happy in the relationship with her even though that was most definitely not the case before I could even tell her myself that she texted me. We were only 18, were young, dumb, immature and had a lot of communication issues. Now that we have been working on them and things have been getting better, she gave me her final concern.\n\nShe does not have any clarify or proof that it wasn't me who sent those anonymous messages and there is a part of her that can't trust me fully because of that, more so because the tone and the vibe of the anonymous texts matched with mine. She knows that she won't ever get anything concrete but it's difficult to brush it off and I'm not sure what I can do from my side to prove to her that she is my world.\n\nTldr: ex and I have worked on almost everything. The final hurdle is convincing her to fully trust me even though I had absolutely no hand in the situation and I'm not sure how I can reinforce her \n\nAny advice would be much appreciated ",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I 23(M) broke up with my ex-girlfriend 21 (F) in December 2024. Long story short, I was putting on efforts but not getting anything in return it kept on happening for almost 1.5 years until I finally decided to become toxic and treat her the way she treated. It was an online relationship we have never met, never even talked on call just texts. I should have walked away instead of becoming toxic because now she just keeps coming back and ruining my peace.\n\nLet's call my ex 'R'. Now I have a cousin sister who is very close to me let's call her 'M'. She was the only family member that knew about my relationship. So M followed R on insta and R followed her back. Now after our breakup I told M that me and R broke up but never told her to unfollow R on insta and all.\n\nTbh I was doing really good in life everything's back on track I am disciplined, hitting the gym regulay and better than ever until one day she decides to come up with new drama. She told one of her friends that how I treated her and he ended up calling my number and started to threaten me. I didn't know how to react because I was too amazed. It has been 5 months after our breakup and she decided to come back like this. Truly fascinating. I then contacted M to text R and ask her what is all this. She did the same and then R suggested M ke we can make a GC on insta in which we can talk if he(I) want to. I ended up texting her and she fucked with my mental health so bad that I cried infront of M(I never cry in front of anyone doesn't matter how close the person is).\n\nLet's fast forward to yesterday, I was chilling in the noon and suddenly my M texted me and said that R texted her. Now when we were in relationship R once logged in my insta account on her phone but to this day insta shows my profile to her in the switch accounts section even though I changed the password. I told M ke usko boldo mere mein se remove nahi hora otherwise I would have done that. Then after almost two hours R texted me on WhatsApp explaining the issue I resolved the same and then blocked her on WhatsApp too. Now she texted me (SMS) that she wants to talk about something and I should listen to her once and I won't regret that. She then texted me on insta saying I wanted peace this that and said I wrote some letters for you because you blocked me I still wanted you to know. In the letter she said she still loves me and all but she have no expectations from me and she knows nothing can be fixed now but she doesn't give a fuck and she still loves me. I read those letters and took out all my frustration about what she did to me. Idk what the fuck then happened she started ranting about some other guy(different from the one who called me a month back) that he is too mature, she doesn't need to force anything with her, he is very hot, and elder than her. She also told me that he said he has a crush on her but she denied him at that time because she was too confused, but now she is going to say yes to him after sometime as everythings fixed.I didn't react to that I said good for you and all and once she was done talking I blocked her on insta again.\n\nNow I wasn't really feeling anything until a few hours ago. Everything just seems so wrong rm. I have my exams in 4 days but I can't stop thinking about all this I was very bold about my decision until now but now I am very sad about everything I don't know what to do. Any suggestions would be helpful and also thank you if you read it until here :).\n\nTL;DR: My ex came back said she still loves me and then started ranting about some other guy whom she is going to say yes and left.",

      "content": "During the first couple weeks of us dating, I moved in with him because my job was much closer to his place (my house is around an hour by transit to my work). \n\nEverything was really good. \n\nI didn’t expect to be so comfortable with someone so quickly and we rarely ever fought, even though we made jokes like “couples that move in together are bound to get tired of each other”. But it never happened. \n\nAround six months in, his parents moved back into the apartment with him and noone knows we’re together and obviously the circumstances are kinda weird so I moved back home. \n\nI didn’t realize how little we text and call each other. My boyfriend’s taking summer courses while working right now so naturally he’s really busy so I don’t want to take away from his work or school. \n\nBut I take a step back and look at our messages and it’s literally just me telling him about my day and his little dry responses and that’s it. \n\nI see him once a week for maybe 3 hours max now. Sometimes we play games together. I’m not sure if this is the type of relationship I can handle. \n\nCouple years ago I got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and kind of brushed it off and didn’t tell anyone, not even my boyfriend. \n\nNow that I’m in an actual relationship though, all those sessions about my unhealthy attachment issues finally make sense. \n\nI go crazy knowing he’s not coming home to me yk and not talking to him about my day and hearing his struggles at work or whatever is lowkey affecting me a lot more than I thought. \n\nLike I’d somehow convinced myself that he doesn’t want me anymore so that I can move on. And we havent even broken up or anything 😭😭 \n\nI’m just convinced that he shouldn’t be in a relationship with someone who needs attention like me, and that he should just focus on school and work. \n\nI don’t know it’s just been really hard. Should I just break up with him or like how do I cope. Like I genuinely feel ill.\n\nTLDR: I was living with my man for six months and recently moved out. I’m going crazy cuz we dont really text or call and I see him once a week (maybe once in two weeks). He’s really busy so I get it but if giving me the attention I want is too much, maybe we arent so good together. I don’t know.",

      "content": "I am not the type to usually turn to an internet forum for advice, but I'm genuinely the biggest emotional wreck I have been, in the short life I have lived thus far.\n\nI (18F), and my boyfriend (18M) have been dating for 3.5 months. Prior to relationship, we were best friends, and did everything together. I would say that our relationship was better than we actually started dating. And then, one day he asked me out on facetime at like 3am, and me being madly in love with him, said yes.\n\nHe insisted our relationship remain secret, because he wanted to take time to 'figure things out' between us, and not have any meddling from the people around us at school, which makes sense, because of a lot of nosy friends we have. Plus, we just finished junior year, and it made sense to focus a little more on school right before college applications.\n\nBut, here is the issue: we haven't done *anything.* It's almost been 4 months. No good morning/goodnight texts, no dates, nothing affectionate, no compliments, TBH it feels like our friendship was more affectionate. Every time I bring up that we should tell our friends, he's always 'busy' and pushes it back. Lately, he's stopped calling me too. He slips in rude remarks towards me at times, is friends with my ex-best friend who he knows I was personally hurt by a lot, and when we talk, it just seems like he's not interested.\n\nI honestly just want my best friend back. I want a relationship that's *good,* not whatever this is. I ask to 'hangout' because he doesn't wanna go on dates, and he can't even make time for that.\n\nThe advice I am looking for:\n\n* Is breaking up the wisest decision?\n* How do I tell him that I want an *actual* relationship? I'm so bad at communicating and I want to get it across that I don't want to waste my time in something that is barely dating.\n\nTL;DR - **female high school senior upset her boyfriend is not showing affection/putting effort in relationship, doesn't know how to communicate that to him.**",

      "title": "What should I do ?",
      "content": "Well Im in this relationship for like 2 1/2 years and now I have come to a point where I feel so fed up and hopeless. (I am 25M and My girlfriend is also the same age)At the beginning first four months of our relationship was so fun and I was so happy, we went fun dates ,constantly communicated with each other, everyday start with a phone call and everything Felt so great. She was so caring, loving, supportive person. At the moment she was working in an office and suddenly after few months she changed her job where she had to do work from home. Her shift was also from evening to midnight night. This is the point where our relationship changed . She has strict parents and she is very obedient to them. She updates almost everything to her mom except our relationship because she knew they ll be serious and strict when it comes to relationships so we kept it as a secret from them. With her new job the connection we had started to loose. I felt so distant from her because we were not able to meet for months because she’s not coming out from her house that often. Even the phone calls we had and the chat we had began to drop. Although we texted I always liked to meet her in person and spend some time with her. I endured this for like 4/5 months and didn’t told her about it , because i didn’t wanted to cause any trouble because she was doing her bachelor and was in here final year. But I held my feelings on and finally came to a point i cant keep it anymore so I Addressed my issue to her that I cant carry out a relationship like this without her presence.  She said that she understands my situation but she said that she can carry on a relationship like this without seeing each because she believes in trust. For the moment I said fine I ll wait for you just get your exams done and finish the degree . Time to time we met each other like once in 2/3 months . Communicating with her also felt difficult because we had completely 2 different lifestyles because I work typically job from 9 to 5 while she was doing a job from Evening till midnight so most of the day time she sleeps and rest to work in the night shift and i sleep at night because i have work in the next day. So just like that our texts also began to drop short and it hit me hard and the distant and pain I had to endure just because I miss her was immense. She was completely fine with our relationship and didn’t cared much about going on a date or meeting me. Then we had few arguments time to time where I asked her out to go on a date where she refused to come out because her parents were strict and she cant tell them about it. Then i asked her to say something else that you have work or something to do but she refused to lie to her parents. So we had these arguments frequently. \n\nAnyway she was able to complete here bachelor and still our relationship was like a long distance relationship. (Although we live 20km apart). We met few times and each time we go on a date she brings one of her friends. At first I was fine with it because she tells her parents that she’s going out with friends so her parents give her permission . But with time It annoyed me because we are meeting after a long time and all I want is to have some peaceful time with her and she brings a friend which really pissed me off. I told her about this and asked not to bring any friends but she said that’s the only way she can come out and can’t lie to her parents. \n\nWe had so many arguments like these and I was very patient earlier but began to loose my temper quickly after first 1 1/2 of our relationship. I felt so helpless and overwhelmed with the thought of shes not with me. My mood began to change easily because my emotions were totally depending on her. The love and attachment i have with her caused me to behave in this way where I felt impossible to live without her I always wanted to feel her presence, meet her .\n\nEach time I see my friends doing good with there relationships makes me wonder why me? Seeing them enjoying time with their loved ones and me struggling to have proper time with her makes me feel so upset and stressed out.\n\nBy the way she went outings with her office friends frequently where didn’t had time to spend with me. Even if we meet , we ll meet at the end of one of her outing with office friends where I come to drop her to her house. So we only get like 1 hour to have a chat . I got pissed here too because she spent good time with her colleagues and go on trips outings but only has 1 or 2 hours maximum for me. I always wandered am i not on her priority list because i felt like i treated like an option.\n\nThen I asked to break up because i can’t continue like this . She said she can’t break up because she wants this relationship. Although I got broke up but after few days she started texting me again saying she cant carry on like this . Then we got back together . After few months we again ends up in an argument and break up and this became a habit. We break up and then getting back to relationship but I was so fed up and up to now this pattern continues. There’s no happiness anymore only we do is argue and both of us refuse to let go even knowing all we do is argue and breaking our hearts. All she asks from me is to wait for the right time for her to fix these things and tell about me to her parents but when i ask when is that going to happen? She says I don’t know. Which pisses me again. Seeing her enjoying with her friends and not me breaks me every day and I don’t know what to do with this relationship . To wait or to let go . \n\nTLDR - I am having this relationship for 2 1/2 years and my girlfriend barely comes to meet me .\nWhat should I do?",

      "content": "I’ve been dating my a friend for (f30) for 2 months and we were friends for 3 months before this. \n\nI’m very calm, chill person but can be extroverted in some social settings. And she’s switched on to go all the time. \n\nShe’s been in 2 pretty awful relationships with women in the past. One was violent and manipulative and another very anxious. They hated on a lot of her friends causing some to cut themselves out of her life etc. \n\nThe insecurities im dealing with is how highly she speaks of a new friend of hers. She was feeling low this morning and says “I’ll switch up once I see Claire”, “Claire will cheer me up”. Last night it’s “I love Claire, she’s my wife, she’s such an amazing great human being, being with her fills my cup” “she’s great she supports me without me needing to ask as she knows I won’t ask” “wifey has my back”.\n\nA barrier I’ve faced is her saying I’m important and a priority but I get very little verbal reassurance so hearing how passionate she is about Claire seems to hit a nerve. So I’m unsure if this is something I need to work on internally within myself or something else. I guess I feel like I want to be the person she says will cheer her up, will have her back. In the past she told me shares with Clare if she’s feeling down and she loves how she immediately asks for a call to talk it through but said she can’t do that with me as it means being more vulnerable and it’s harder to let me in. \n\nShe also has an ex is mentally unwell and pretty much stalks her. And Sarah shared she can’t stop talking with her as she could serious harm herself and she’s lost an ex to that in the past as she her partner at the time wasn’t happy with it. I realised her ex will always be in the picture it seems. Unless her ex stops texting then she won’t stop conversing as she doesn’t want her to lose it and hurt herself. This person will continue being a parasite for a very long time. And won’t let her go. \n\nNon of this makes me feel good. And unsure on if I should continue. \n\nShe’s has great qualities. Easy to talk to, cared for me when I was very upset, so empathetic and emotionally intelligent. \n\nTL:DR\n\nDo I need to do something work on myself to be more secure or are these things to raise and maybe part ways due to my insecurities?",

      "title": "Trying to learn how to trust my boyfriend’s (32M) friendships w/coworkers after my ex-husband of 10 yrs left me (40F) to marry his coworker",
      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m looking for advice on learning to trust my relationship after going through betrayal trauma in my previous relationship/marriage. I’m doing all of the “normal” things (therapy, journaling, etc), but it feels like I’m never going to be able to get past the trauma and PTSD that I deal with from how my marriage ended….\n\nI’ve been with my boyfriend for 3 years now. He is literally perfect…..the sweetest, most considerate, most loving, most thoughtful, most supportive, most consistent man I’ve ever met. I literally ask myself every single day how I was able to come across someone with SUCH a beautiful spirit, I feel incredible grateful to be here💜.\n\nThe problem that I’m having is that after being married to my kids’ father for 10 years, trusting him FULLY, and then finding out that the coworker of his that I always wondered about and always asked him to draw boundaries with was an actual problem and that they were having a full blown affair (once I discovered the affair, we “worked on our marriage” for an extra year while he continued to cheat and I ultimately decided that I couldn’t be with him any longer…..they got married 3 months after our divorce was final), it’s been really hard for me to trust my boyfriend in regards to his friendships with female coworkers, 2 specific ones in particular. \n\nI believe in platonic friends and he’s never done anything wrong when it comes to them necessarily, but every single time they interact over text or have conversations over the phone (he will even talk to them on speaker and show me the text convos to prove that the convos are innocent), my anxiety is through the roof. Recently he stated that he wanted to give me FULL access to these friendships, but wanted to delete the text threads entirely to start fresh (to avoid me seeing insignificant texts that may read strangely and it send me into a tailspin) and then give me his password in case I wanted to ever check his phone, at any time. I’ve checked a few times but I hate feeling like I need to, and I never find anything strange.\n\nHe doesn’t work with these ladies anymore, but when he did, with the first one, he used to go on daily Starbucks runs with her, help her in her dept a lot, talk and text quite a bit, and she used to pop up in his office while we were on the phone or would call his desk phone a few times a week (he would always put her on speaker, it was always innocent) - she’s married, two young children. With the other one, she made passes at him the first year they worked together (he would curve her each time), but then decided that she would stop with those since he wasn’t entertaining them, they had a short hiatus when she switched jobs, and then she returned to his building and what was once a sporadic coworker relationship turned into a friendship- to the point that now they catch up a few times per month to see how life is treating the other since they no longer work together (she’s engaged but her fiancé is long distance).\n\nHe’s gone out for drinks with these ladies plus one other one at his job (that one acts like a little sister to them and I’ve never been concerned with her), and they’re all good friends/had group chats, etc., but he’s never crossed lines that I’ve known of and they refer to me a lot, but I’ve never involved myself either. \n\nI know that 90% of this anxiety I have is due to the way my marriage ended and my ex husband betraying me with his coworker, and I really want to find a way to get past it…it’s a daily struggle and a big source of stress for me, but he enjoys these friendships and I don’t want to place restrictions on him based on my own trauma. Just looking for practical ways to look at this situation in a healthy way.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend got really close with 2 female coworkers (daily Starbucks runs with one, texting, talking on the phone, going out for drinks as a group- one is married, one is engaged) and now that they no longer work together, they still keep in touch, but I’ve been uncomfortable with these relationships since the beginning because of my ex-husband of 10 years cheating on me and leaving me to marry his coworker and I’m trying to learn to trust my boyfriend when it comes to them. Boyfriend has given me full access to check his phone to reassure me that it’s all innocent and has always answered their calls around me on speaker, etc., but I’m still extremely anxious anytime he talks to them.\n",

Like it’s getting kinda stupid to me. We’ve been together for about 3 months. \n\nAnd like what he says, “i also dk why im so busy” even when he’s an ACCA student since 2021 JANUARY BRUH, and it’s not like he super actively helps his mum with the shop. I need to reevaluate his priorities because i think i put out more emotional labor into this whereby I kinda plan on when i should see him?\n\nplus im gonna go over to work in singapore soon in a few months or so, if he can’t even handle this irl, what about when we’re long distance. If it’s gonna be like this, I’d rather we stay friends or not be in a relationship.\n\nTLDR:\nI’m done with dry, dragged-out texting. From now on, only calling or meeting if we wanna talk properly. I feel like I’m putting in more effort while he’s just vaguely “busy.” With me moving to Singapore soon, I need to rethink this relationship — if it’s already like this now, long distance won’t work.

      "content": "Good people, I need some help.\n\nMy husband (63M) and I (60F) have been happily married 30+ years. Five or so years ago he started cycling. He loved it and I was happy he found something he enjoyed and was good for him although I felt he was spending too much money on bikes, tools, supplies, rides in races and weekend trips.  \n\nThe last few years have been bad with the time he spends riding. It’s getting unbearable for me. He’s gone all the time. He takes two cycling classes a week at the gym, he rides there when he’s not taking classes and he’s out on the road or a path 4-6 days a week for 4-6 or 7 hours at a time coming home after 10 at night on weeknights. Oh, and works a full-time job on top of this.\n\nLast month we went to Florida for three days to visit my family and of course he had to rent a bike and ride. In the last 5 months he’s left me alone to ride on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day, Easter and Mother’s Day. He probably went riding on Valentines Day too, I don’t remember. As I post this, he’s in Chillicothe Ohio on a weekend ride and visit with friends.\n\nThis is not a communication issue as I have joked, talked, complained, yelled and cried and cried all many many times. I love my husband dearly and don’t want a divorce. But I can’t take being alone anymore. I'd rather be separated and alone than married and alone. But if I leave him, I feel I’d be letting our kids and grandkids down. I’m so lost and don’t know what to do. Nothing I do or say makes a difference to him.\n\nI'm hoping a few people are willing to comment so I can show him this and maybe we can both learn something, or I can gain some insight. Thanks ahead for your helpful comments.\n\nTLDR, My husband rides his bike and leaves me, his wife alone way too much and I have no idea what to do. Can you please offer some advice?",

      "content": "\nCurious if maybe his behavior is reflective of an issue that is too large for me to solve. Looking for hope/input this could be fixed. \n\nMy bf (26M) and I (26F) have been together for 3 years. We’ve always had communication struggles, and eventually we encountered trust issues. He still doesn’t fully trust me, but I do everything I can to make him feel secure.\n\nWhenever we argue, I try to stay calm, validate him, and apologize if I mess up. Sometimes I fail but I always take a step back. Even when he’s mean or uncooperative, I understand he’s not secure in me or our relationship so I stay patient. Unfortunately, it always spirals into “If I was the only guy in your life, you’d act differently,” regardless of what we’re arguing about. No matter how much I try to calm him, he escalates and doesn’t calm down until I break down completely or cry. Sometimes, when I push back after being worn down, he’ll say, “There it is,” as if confirming a narrative about me.\n\nAfter today’s argument I’m really starting to question if he’s measuring my commitment by what I’m willing to tolerate. The way he digs into me when I don’t comply with his expectations is destroying me (it’s not the first time). \n\nToday, he got mad because I went back to sleep after my 9am alarm went off while we were sleeping on FaceTime. He was really annoyed after I was sweet and happy to hear him this morning because he’s “Glad that he got his sleep disturbed for no reason.” I asked why he was taking it out on me and it resulted in him cancelling our plans.\n\nGot a text saying,\n“You have 0 empathy… you fucked one of my only two days off where I couldve just slept in….just to go back to sleep… you don’t respect me because you didn’t immediately apologize. No sorry, nothing, u dgaf.” \n\nEven after I apologized, he kept going. Eventually he came to pick me up and gave me an ultimatum of “take full responsibility or we are done.” I didn’t, so he dropped it and agreed he could have acted more cooperatively.\n\nHe said he calmed down because he realized I was right and he had to control his emotions more, but is he just saying what I wanna hear? He tells me he wants to make this work too but he struggles managing his own emotions. \n\nWhat’s the best approach to this? Should I be more considerate next time? What can I do to make it better? He said it’s on him too, but what can I do?\n\nTldr: Bf of 3 years escalated situation where my alarm clock awoke him. There is a pattern where situations like these (or me not taking his advice) leads to him saying he doesnt feel respected and thinks I lack empathy when I try to suggest a softer approach. What do?

      "content": "if anyone reads this, ily. My(22) boyfriend(24) and I met last year in April 2024. We were both doing an internship in the same city. We had a month-long rendezvous and it was a great time for both of us.  At the early stages of our dates we agreed that we didnt want a relationship because we would both be leaving in May 2024 back to our cities and didnt want to do long distance. Fast forward May 2024, when we're both back in our town, he wants to keep talking to me and we decided to be exclusive. He flies down to see me in June 2024 and we officially start dating August 2024 because I had moved back to our internship city which was only a 3 hour train ride to his city. It didnt feel like a long distance relationship because I would at least see him once a month for an extended amount of time because he has a remote job. I meet his family in September and he meets mine later on in November.\n\nAll is well until December, im catching up with a male friend who also did the same internship in the spring and knew him and I. When i mention to him that Im dating him his face changes and he warns me that hes not a good person. I ask why he says that he would cheat on his previous gf and he hooked up with a another girl in the spring. I confront my boyfriend about this in person the next day and he admits the cheating on his previous relationship and tells me all the details. Up until this point we had never spoken about each others pasts. I also ask him if there was any overlap with me and any other girl when we went on dates. i also ask if he slept w anyone else in the spring bc we had slept together and i wanted know. he denies and only says he kissed another girl in the spring but it was before he met me. I decide to believe him but explicitly said \"if i find out youre lying to me about any of this information im going to break up with you\" he agrees and we carry on.\n\nfast forward April 2025 i find out he was lying. he did sleep with another woman a day before our first date. I confront him about this detail and he confesses. he leaves the room for a few minutes, comes back, and proceeds to tell me that he also slept with another girl in May 2024, 2 weekends before we both went back to our hometowns. that weekend he told me we wouldnt be able to see each other because his cousins were coming into to town. (obv a lie) he says that the girl was from his hometown and he had split a hotel and scheduled all this a little before he met me.\n\nWell, when he told me this i stood on business and broke up with him. It was clear that he was hurt but he understood/respected my decision and agreed to go no contact with me. I broke no contact after 5 days. Its been a little over a month and we have been in contact and we are trying again because I genuinely do believe that he is remorseful and is changing. I told him that if we are going to get back together he's going to need to give me time and ask me out all over again. He understands that im more upset about the lie than the actual things he did when we were talking because we had both established that we didnt want anything more.\n\nOur relationship has been the best one i've ever had (despite the lying, yikes). i KNOW hes never cheated on me, hes always treated me right, yada yada yada. The only reason why I'm trying again is because I love this person. The only thing that has changed about how he treats me now is that hes  being very understanding and attentive to how im feeling about the situation and if i want to talk about it he talks about it with me. He is very sweet, attentive, and makes time to talk to me every day, which is literally how he would treat me throughout our relationship anyway. He has given me no doubt except for those lies. Not sure what to do since I do want to get back together with him but now im just starting to doubt him about random things.\n\nObviously im hurt about him lying and also grossed out about him hooking up w 2 different girls in the month that I first met him. The thing that is hard to move past is just the lying. I dont want to be in a relationship where im doubting things he tells me or second guessing things. Im not sure about what to do.\n\nTL;DR: I caught my boyfriend in a lie and I dont know if I should continue with him.",

      "content": "TLDR: Should I end my relationship with no romantic spark that I’ve realised I’ve been staying in out of guilt? Or is it still possible to revive the relationship?\nAnd if so, should I break up after exam season or ASAP, given that going on a break isn’t an option?\n\nI’ve been dating my girlfriend for nine months, and known her for basically a year. Back then, when she confessed to me, I didn’t really know much about love. But I still wanted to try things out and see where things would go, even though I only valued her as a friend.\n\nI wasn’t someone who liked looking into the future, but her kindness and her constant gifts made me feel really valued, and she eventually became one of the only people I could be weird and stupid in front of and still love me for who I was.\n\nAlthough everything seemed good during our honeymoon phase, I always had a weird feeling that something was off. For the whole time, I was searching for a spark in our relationship, but that spark never came. We did many things that couples would, and yet it didn’t feel intensely romantic. I also realised I never truly appreciated her gifts and her being there for me; it only just hit me now.\nShe was anxiously attached to me; she would constantly shower me with love and affection. It seemed fine at first, but after some time, it started tiring me. \nI never broke up with her because it feels like fixing what we have would hurt less than breaking up. It did work, though, I guess. Every problem we had, we resolved it in the end, and she would grow as a person. And now she went from a loner who hated everyone to someone who has a huge friend group and liked everywhere around college. Our relationship always seemed to strengthen after each argument, but our core incompatibilities still remain.\n\nShe was already anxiously attached from trauma from her childhood, and my indifference to her sometimes is definitely not doing her any good. It’s at the point where she starts monitoring me whenever I go out, being cautious if I’m near any girls. Every time she senses distance, she showers me with affection. \nShe’s not good at communicating either - I have a huge tendency to overthink, and she only ever tells me the problem when I have to ask her persistently. Normally, she never tells me what the problem is. This means every time she starts being “off”, I start to overthink and ask her a bunch of questions to get to the root of the problem (I realise this is also partly my own problem, but her communication style doesn’t exactly help, and it’s hard for her to openly communicate despite many arguments about this).\nI also realised that the time I cried out of “love” for her, it was just out of pure guilt. The love that she had shown me and the fact that I couldn’t reciprocate it keeps feeding my guilt, so I just kept on letting her love and affection chain me in the relationship so I could prove to myself that I could love her like she loves me.\n\nAt this point in the relationship, it seems like I’ve reached a kind of stable point where there aren’t as many ups and downs. I’ve subconsciously searched for reasons to break up with her for a long time, and now I’m kind of mentally checked out. Every time we argue nowadays feels draining to the point I just want to break up, but I convince myself I’m overreacting. \n\nIt’s just hard to let her slip away when she’s one of the only people who truly love me for who I am. We can act however we want around and we still never judge each other - and we could always smile and have a bunch of fun.  It’s eating away at my self-esteem too. I feel like I’ve absolutely failed this relationship. \nMy birthday is coming up and she has gifts for me, which just feels pointless if I’m going to break up with her. Another part of me is telling me to continue the relationship, because although I’m not IN love with her, I still love her, and maybe I just haven’t been trying hard enough.\n\nI have important exams that will end in about two weeks, and I’m struggling with what to do. I can’t go on a break with her because I had already tried it. Should I try to end it now before my birthday gifts, or should I receive them and wait until after the exams and sort it out afterwards?",

At first, everything felt like normal friendship to me, but I soon noticed a shift – something between us started to feel different. There was a tension in the air, something unspoken. We spent a lot of time together, I made her laugh a lot, we drank together, had deep conversations. There were no explicitly romantic signs, but she didn’t shy away from physical closeness either.\n\nFor example, during a long bus ride, we sat right next to each other, touching shoulders and legs the entire time. She could’ve moved away but didn’t. That kind of proximity just didn’t feel like pure friendship to me. Then again, there were also moments where she seemed more distant – sometimes saying she needed a “break” because the trip felt overwhelming (to be fair, it was quite packed and intense). In the end, she even flew home two days earlier than planned.\n\nEspecially during the last days of the trip, it felt like the emotional tension between us peaked. Nothing ever happened physically, but I had to seriously hold myself back – which is unusual for me (I am usually more of a coward in this situations). On the last night before she left, she stayed up drinking and talking with me far longer than she originally intended.\n\nAfter she went to sleep, I texted her and told her honestly that I liked her – not in a pushy way, just openly. The next day, she replied that for her it‘s only friendship. That hit me really hard.\n\nThe contact afterwards felt odd. Sometimes she replied like everything was normal, sometimes not at all (though I know she has ADHD, which might explain some of the inconsistency). Eventually, I suggested we talk in person again.\n\nDuring that talk, I asked her if she really never felt anything between us. She said no – for her, it had always been friendship. She also told me she’s currently emotionally focused on someone else – a guy she’s been seeing for a while now and with whom she‘s in a kind of open relationship. She has a very avoidant attachment style and seems emotionally blocked in many ways.\n\nAfter that, I sent her one final message. I told her I respected her answer and didn’t blame her – but that it had hurt me deeply, and I wasn’t sure I could continue the friendship as it was. Her tone had been very distant and emotionally detached, and that really added to the pain. She never responded to that message.\n\nNow I’m stuck here feeling lost, confused, and unsure what really happened – what it meant to me, what it meant to her (if anything), and whether there’s any future at all for our connection.\n\nTL;DR:\nI went on a two-week trip with a close friend (f) and developed feelings. We had a lot of emotional and physical closeness, but she said it was “just friendship” for her. After I opened up to her, she became distant and eventually stopped replying. I’m confused and hurt, and don’t know how to move on or whether a friendship is still possible.\n",

      "content": "I’ve been talking to this girl since the beginning of the year. The thing is she’s exactly the kind of woman I’ve always said I wanted. She has the mentality mindset values, everything I’ve been looking for. She’s mature understanding and emotionally grounded.\n\nBut while we’ve been talking I ended up falling for someone else someone I eventually broke up with. After that I was seeing another girl. And now I’m here realizing that I don’t actually have real feelings for this first girl I’ve been talking to for so long.\n\nAnd it’s killing me because I want to love her. I want to focus only on her. She’s loyal she genuinely loves me, she’s obsessed with me in the best way and even her whole family knows about me. She traveled a long way just to meet me and I finally saw her in person for the first time recently.\n\nI’ve done things for her. I’ve bought her gifts and tried to show that I care. I’ve been trying to build something real with her. But it still doesn’t feel like it did with other girls. With past relationships I’ve felt the spark the butterflies the excitement and I don’t feel that here.\n\nTo be completely honest I’ve dated women in the past who were very beautiful and she’s not as beautiful to me. I don’t know if that’s shallow or wrong but I can’t lie and say it doesn’t affect me. I wish it didn’t but maybe it’s part of why I’m struggling to feel something deeper.\n\nI was hoping something would change when we finally met in person but it didn’t. I still didn’t feel the attraction or the emotional pull I was hoping for. And I hate this because she deserves love. She deserves someone who’s crazy about her. She’s done everything right and I still feel empty.\n\nI feel stuck. I don’t want to hurt her. I don’t want to break up with her. I’m scared of how it’ll affect her and what her family will think. But how can I stay in something when I don’t feel what I know I should?\n\nIs it possible for love to grow over time? Can you choose to love someone and eventually feel what’s missing? Or am I just trying to force something that isn’t there?\n\nI don’t know what to do. I really need some honest advice.\n\nTL;DR: Been talking to a girl for months who is \nperfect on paper and loves me deeply. Finally met her in person and felt no spark or attraction. I’ve dated girls I was more physically attracted to and feel guilty that it matters. I want to love her but I don’t and I don’t know if I ever will. Should I stay and hope the feelings come or end it now?",

      "content": "I know reddit os probably not the place to come for advice but.\n\nmy bf (20M) and I 20(NB) got together a few months ago (<6), but have known eachother for years as we went to school together. he's a very sweet guy, respects me and hasn't done anything wrong/to hurt me/anything like that. before he asked me out I felt extremely lonely and as if I was undesirable, weird, off putting, nobody would ever want me, etc, that type of thing, and when we did get together I was very happy.\n\nrecently I haven't been so sure and have been considering whether I should end the relationship - I do love this guy, but I don't know if it's like that (I have a lot of trouble distinguishing between what parts of what I feel for people). I also just feel that I'm not good for him, even if he says things are okay. I've been having less energy to hang out/spend time together even when I know how much he wants to. I hadn't been with anyone for over a year before him, but my previous relationship had been long and I had been ready to spend the rest of time with that person, and I feel guilty that I don't feel the same way with my current bf - there isn't anything he's done to prompt this, and I know I haven't been with him for as much time, but I don't like that I am having second thoughts even if it is early on.\n\nI have been having a rough time with mental health/gender dysphoria recently so I don't know if I'm just having a tough time and being down on everything or if I truly am unsure and I don't want to make any big decisions that I might regret, but I also don't want to be stuck with these thoughts of \"do I really want this\" because I feel horrible about them. I don't want to hurt this guy because genuinely he doesn't deserve that but I also don't want to lead him on in any way and I feel stuck. Also, with the way I felt before our relationship I don't like the thought that im having that maybe i only said yes to him because i was feeling lonely at the time. I would usually talk about something like this with my friends but they're friends with him too and I don't want them to form any type of view on our relationship so I'd rather do this and be anonymous. I want to speak to them when I'm more sure of how I feel\n\ntl;dr - I'm not sure if I want to be with my boyfriend anymore after a few months together and idk what to do",

      "content": "Is toxic to healthy possible and how do I tell my family now that they don’t want me with this person? \n\nI guess I’m just wanting to lay everything on the table and get advice from outsiders. I’m a 29F, single mom, 9 year old son. My ex is a 29M. \n\n**TLDR** we were unhealthy broke up for 6 months and now things feel better. How do I tell my family? \n\nWhen we first started seeing each other 5 years ago, we were both in stages of our lives where we were drinking a lot and sort of in “party scenes”. I wasn’t a single mom at the time, my son’s dad was very involved in his life. (My sons dad and my ex are two different people - just to clarify)\n\nMy ex and I were just unhealthy. We both had traumas from our childhoods that triggered each-other. Things I did triggered him and things he did triggered me. Our communication was HORRIBLE and I never felt heard, understood or seen by him. He would often criticize me (I seem to have some kind of pull towards men that don’t think I’m enough, gotta love daddy issues). I felt manipulated by him in a way that he would say what I wanted but actions didn’t usually reflect through over time: We also have extremely different attachment styles, I’m a fearful avoidant and run fast as fuck any time my nervous system doesn’t feel safe. He’s an anxious attachment and just wants to fix fix fix everything right then and there. \n\nIn the beginning we had some trust issues not because he cheated but because I was ready for commitment way before he was and the first year-2 years of our relationship didn’t feel like we were actually together. He wasn’t cheating or seeing anyone else, but he liked girls photos, did things that made me feel like his eyes wandered. That created a dynamic where I didn’t trust, wanted to run but still felt so safe and comfortable with him and was basically running off the “idea” of us. \n\nOver time, I would run, he would chase and fix and we did that on repeat for 5 years. Lots of criticism and manipulation to keep me around, I didn’t feel like he even actually liked who I was at my core but liked the idea of me being his. My family and friends hated seeing what I became.\n\nI gained a bunch of weight and became super depressed and my nervous system was an absolute wreck. Very triggerable, very unwell. \n\n6 months ago, we split. I had done quite a bit of research on healing and nervous system regulation and was so done feeling like I was just completely drained in the relationship that is supposed to be my most intimate connection. \n\nI lost a bunch of weight, started writing again, meditating, eating right, going to the gym and regulating my system through mindfulness and awareness. I feel my mindset and lifestyle has completely shifted and I actually feel like I can see clearly and feel like myself again. \n\nNow for the kicker - we just reconnected recently. He’s been in therapy, his words and actions are making me feel more seen, understood and valued than ever before. I don’t wanna be a broken record and be like “this time feels different” because I can’t even count how many times I’ve said that. But thus far, he’s been 1000 times more patient with me as far as  making sure I’m ok with reconnecting, he’s constantly speaking to my value as a woman and I can tell he’s truly taking the time to understand me when I’m explaining how I feel to him (something he didn’t do before), he’s validating me and what feels even safer, is he’s leading me through my big emotions. He understands my attachment style and is putting in effort to make sure I feel safe even if that means running for 10 minutes when something makes me feel uneasy. I feel like he’s making space for me in ways he didn’t before and in return it feels like it’s opening doors for me to heal. I’ve been much more willing to communicate and acknowledge ways I need to grow or things I’m doing wrong and I feel like I’m being led into a phase of healing I’ve never seen in partnership. He just feels so much more mature and healed and aware. When problems are coming up, we are pausing and working THROUGH them in a way we never have. We meeting in the middle like it’s us against the issue vs us against each-other like we did in the past. On top of it all, my son is so happy he’s back in our lives. \n\nI’m feeling nervous to even tell my family and friends, they care so much for me and they’ve watched me run in loops with this man. I’m also fearful that there is manipulation happening and he’s just doing/saying all of this until I’m comfortable and then things will go back to how they were. I’m trying my best to keep my eyes clear but in the moment it’s easy to be blinded by how much you care for someone. \n\n*** I just want to put it out there too that there was never any cheating or physical abuse in our relationship*** our toxicity was on both ends and we were always so wrapped up in our own emotion that we didn’t make time for the other persons.  he would never lay a hand on me and I’ve always felt very very physically safe with him, it was emotionally that I didn’t feel safe.

      "content": "I, 15F, have been in a talking stage with 15M, for about seven months, and I’m scared and don’t know how to end it. He initially reached out to me over Instagram, because he wanted to get to know me, as we did go to the same school. This was about in October and we had a solid relationship until about December. Something about me, is that I really prioritise my time and I don’t like getting interrupted during that time, so around that time, every time hed message me I’ll get super annoyed and I just didn’t really want to reply— additionally I am someone who doesn’t text often so I’m not used to texting a lot or having extensive conversations online.\n\nIn late December, I gave him a long text clearly explaining my reasonings and thanking him for the time together and everything. I should also add, we were also really scared of each other- like talking in real life so we never really talked during our talking stage during that time excluding one or two small interactions. The other worst part is this is about three days after he had sent me a long text confessing his feelings and his hopes for our relationship in the future.\n\nFast forward to about April, and I hear that he still likes me, and honestly I still miss him at the time as well, so we started talking. A month later in March, we’ve been talking since then, and also our birthdays were both in May. So for his birthday, I got him a burr basket and just around last week, we finally had the longest interaction, and the first time we went out together into the CBD- where he also gave me my late birthday gift. The problem arises is that if I was to give another paragraph again, it’ll be the second time, and it’s also very abrupt and sudden just like last time, as I haven’t really changed my style of talking, im not dry, and I’m still regularly texting him. I would like to emphasise again, how awkward it would be to send another paragraph on ending things ,because of how sudden and abrupt it was. It’d be completely out of the blue for him- again. I don’t want to be in a relationship which I’m forcing myself to be in, nor do I want to be leading someone on and being fake, so what is the best course of action I should take, or how should I deal with this? Sorry bad grammar, its pretty late rn. \nTLDR: So how do I end a talkingstage without making it awkward due to past experiences with the person?\nThanks",

      "content": "My [31F] relationship with my boyfriend [34M] of seven months feels emotionally surface-level. Most of our conversations feel like small talk, and whenever I try to go deeper, it feels like I hit a wall. I care about him a lot — he’s kind, thoughtful, intelligent, and an animal lover like me — but I can’t shake the feeling that something’s missing.\n\nThis is one of the healthiest relationships I’ve had in terms of consistency and stability. There’s no drama, no mind games. But there’s also no real passion or emotional intimacy. I haven’t been in many relationships, so maybe this is just how most of them are? Still, half a year in, I feel like there should be more emotional depth — real conversations about what moves us, inspires us, challenges us. Instead, it feels like we’re stuck on the surface.\n\nI know my boyfriend’s favorite food and color, but I don’t know what truly drives him. I don’t know what keeps him up at night or lights him up inside. I wish I could be okay with staying in the shallow end, talking about errands and weather and work — but I crave depth. I want to talk about art, spirituality, inner worlds.\n\nI’ve tried to initiate those conversations, but his responses are often short or vague, and I’m left carrying the weight of trying to connect.\n\nTL;DR My relationships lacks depth. \n\nAm I asking for something unrealistic?\n\n",

      "content": "This is gonna be a long one, so buckle up..\n\nI met my partner in 2022 at work, we’ve been good colleagues but I was always into him and thought I would ask him out, cause why not. He thought I had a boyfriend which is why he has never approached me. Since our first date, we’ve been unseparable. We were doing everything together, worked the same shift at work so we basically had same schedules. For year and a half, I felt with him like I am on drugs. The kind of love and affection that people see in movies, not in real life. I was so in love with how he treated me, how he looked at me, how he was always interested in me. If I wanted a necklace, he suprised me with it. I talked about apple watch, and in 2 weeks I got it.. But not only the material stuff, his whole attention was on me. Long story short, a perfect relationship. He also has a 10 year old son, who he has every second weekend and those weekends were spent going on trips, and adventures with his son. I was very open to this, was welcoming of his son eventhough I do not have any experience with kids. And I think this is why my bf was so into me, because he could trust me being around his kid. I always wanted my own family one day, but I’ve accepted this at that time. I went on holiday in May 2023, and when I came back we had a conversation about moving into a bigger place, as a reason he told me his son needs more space (we live in a studio flat). I got a little scared and took a step back from this, I didn’t see us moving for his son who is with us every other weekend. My logic was I want to save more money and buy a house instead of rushing to move because his son needs more space. I’ve explained to him my reasonings why I don’t think this is a good idea, we’ve agreed to wait and that was that. I’ve changed my job, and at this new workplace I mainly work with men. He has also changed his job, now he is a truck driver and he is tramping (gone from monday to friday). Since he knew I am working with men, he was very jealous and wanted to know every single detail of my day which I’ve tried to share, however sometimes there is not much to say. As this is an office environment, there were days where I sat down in front of a screen, listened to music and nothing else happened. He was expecting a long conversation but I just didn’t have much to say. And this started a lot of arguments between us, and even when I shared something he found a reason to argue. For example I went to get a coffee with my male colleague, as we were getting more coffees for everyone and I shared this with my partner, of course it was a big argument cause I went for a coffee with a guy from work.. And this was happening daily, a lot of silly arguments, about his son, about my work.. But he still loved me. He would call me few times a day, flirt with me, etc.\n\nFast forward to February 2025, when he told me he doesnt love me anymore. Of course I panicked and cried and begged, told him let’s give us some time, maybe he will realise he misses me and loves me but he was 100% he lost his feelings. The phonecalls stopped, the interest.. I went on holiday end of March 2025, and when I came back he said he wants to try again, but ever since then, he has been acting weird, when we are intimate it’s not passionate, he doesn’t look at me the same, no more flirting.. I would do anything for this guy which is why I have changed my way of thinking and accepted his son again, as I realised this is the LOML and my soulmate. He keeps telling me he loves me but everytime I tell him I am missing something, he just says he doesn’t want drama and makes an argument. I dont know what to do, I love him but he acts like he doesn’t love me. He said the more I expect the less I will get. When I tell him I would like to feel wanted by him calling me once a day, he says “if I don’t have anything to say, I won’t call you. I am trying my best but it that’s not enough, I can’t help you.” Is there a way to make him be obsessed with me again, like before? \n\nI know past is the past, but we’ve both said this was our best relationship. I am willing to make him happy, give him the fairytale we once had. Why is it so hard for him to love me the same?\n\n\nTL;DR, My partner loved me so much before, only saw me, basically was obsessed with me. After period of arguing over his 10 yo son who lives with his ex, and my new job with male colleagues, he told me he doesnt love me. After a month he tells me he loves me again, but it just hasn’t been the same. Is there a way to recover the spark?",

We had and still have loads in common, same music taste, enjoy the same kind of social events and just generally get on really well. The issues started to arise about a year and a half ago. She had been open about struggles with depression in the past from the get go, as was I, but about 7months in her mental state really took a turn. She stopped wanting to go out and started to rely on me for more and more. It came to a point (I’m not sure when exactly) where I found myself more as her live in carer than her boyfriend. I was responsible for cooking, cleaning, and making sure she was happy. While this was going on I really struggled trying to find work in her area which began to take a toll on my confidence. Eventually though I did managed to find myself a job local to her… until i started to miss shifts because of her mental breakdowns which would make me scared to leave her on her own. This basically culminated in me deciding that we needed a break to figure some things out. Cut to now… and I have no idea what to do. I know that as things are this isn’t a sustainable relationship, but she knows that too and I do think she’s trying to change. I love her and I keep trying to think of how we can go forward but I don’t know if I’m just being optimistic or if my being with her is just enabling her depressed lifestyle. Honestly any advice would be appreciated at this point.\n\n**TL;DR;** my girlfriend’s depression has been taking a heavy toll on both her and me.

      "content": "I would like some relationship advice as I am having trouble navigating my own feelings and have a history of very bad/borderline abusive and definitely toxic relationships. Did a lot of therapy and came out the other side  in a much better spot\n\nFirst things first - gf never been in relationship before (only situationships). I have been in several long term relationships. and recently a short term healthy relationship\n\nIn the beginning I fell in love with girlfriend very hard - we got along very well and I genuinely fell in love with her. Had not connected with someone like her in at least 3 years.\n\nIt took her about a month or two months or so to say I love you after I did. (I said after 3 months she said after maybe 5).\n\nWe both live alone. I knew that I wanted to start a family sometime soonish (5 years out maybe or sooner) and start to settle down and asked about moving in together.\n\nShe said 1 year she would consider.\n\nAsked her again about it after 9 months because I was trying to figure out logistics and again she said she wasn’t ready.\n\nI ended up moving from down the street to a little bit farther away (but we still see each other often and doesn’t really hinder time together).\n\nI did this because I was in a bad commute situation and didn’t want to wait around for her to wanna move in with me. She especially didnt like the idea of moving to suburbs away from city.\n\nAnyways - right around her 30th she started to get distant. She doesn’t really express emotions all the time and its very hard for me to tell if she is upset or happy or sad.\n\nLong story short I brought up moving in again just kind of talking about how it would be nice to split rent and how I would pay way more since I make more. I never discussed this in the past but I wanted to add that bc I am thinking of the future. This was what I thought was a casual conversation and I was just dreaming if a future together.\n\nI guess this triggered her. We got in a fight after trying to communicate and she said that maybe if she cant commit to what I want that maybe we shouldn’t be together. She added a lot of things like saying she hates her self for sending this and she wished everything would be okay.\n\nShe was also triggered by her birthday and had just got a new job but she still doesn’t know what she wants in the future and has no goals etc.\n\nI am not going to lie - when I saw that message it truly broke my heart and I cried and hugged myself and rocked back and forth like a little baby lol.\n\nI texted her and told her I was sorry for pushing too hard. I went over and everything was “fine”.\n\nAnyways - after a few months I brought up our fight because I feel like nothing was ever resolved (here is another common thread - she doesn’t communicate her needs and I am the only one to bring up communication or relationship issues).\n\nShe agreed to go to therapy and has started to figure out her avoidant tendencies and commitment issues.\n\nShe says she loves me and I am everything she ever wanted.\n\nNow the problem is that I have become more anxious ever since she sent that text. I feel like I am just in a waiting pattern now for her to figure out what she wants.\n\nShe has started saying “I love you” more since I asked for that and she barely said it before. And their are other changes she has made.\n\nI dont know if this is normal? I just want to progress the relationship yet it feels like it is stagnating. I am having a hard time discerning if I am pushing too hard because I am anxious or if I am pushing because I just want to build a life together. I know what I want. I wanna marry her and everything.\n\nNow I am starting to feel small bits of resentment. I guess I want to be the one to pull away. She is supposed to come over after work today bc we are bother traveling this weekend - since our last conversation I feel like I am not happy in this relationship.\n\nI feel like the waiting is really getting to me - its only been about 2 months or so since that fight as well.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nGirlfriend mentioned breaking up after I oushed her on moving in after a year and now I cant get over this anxious feeling and feeling bad and feeling stuck. \n\nHow do I know when to call it quits and when to wait around ???",

Since Christmas my feelings have been hurt every now and then. I'm a person who appreciates little details but perceives every little change on connection, how he talks to me, manners, etc. He didn't have anything for me on Christmas and lied saying my present was coming but never arrived any package. On February 14th we had dinner together, fine. I waited until my birthday and he gave me a little sanrio plush that it wasn't my fav character, which is so obvious if you pay 5% of attention. His excuse is that he has no money, but I have never saw him without his tobacco or maria since I know him.\n I saw him expending money on videogames and then he tells me he doesn't want to go on a walk because \"he has no money for a coffee\"... \n\nHe's being rejecting me for months and only having relations like on Christmas or my birthday.  Saying I'm not the problem, that he doesn't feel well and has no desire... That makes me feel so bad and insecure with myself. \n\nSays he loves me but hardly talks to me via WhatsApp or see each other on weekends even he does anything at all during the week. I see him depressed but he doesn't want to talk to me about it and rejects going to therapy. His words doesn't resemble with his actions and viceversa. I feel so lost, angry and sad because after talking about it several times he doesn't change. He doesn't take care of me as I do.\n\n\nI would love to see him as he was at the beginning or a better version of himself. What should I do to get that outcome? Should I wait any longer? \n\n**TL;DR;** : I'm talking about the problems on my relationship (F30, M31) and asking for advice on how should I go through it.",

      "content": "I’ve been with my fiancé for years now, and we have a child together. Lately, I’ve been feeling deeply unseen and emotionally neglected in our relationship. Physical intimacy has been great, and he’s very loving in that way, but the emotional intimacy, the quiet presence, the affection just to connect (not lead to sex), has been really missing.\n\nMy love language is emotional connection. And when that’s not present, I don’t just feel “a little off.” I feel unimportant and not prioritised. \n\nThere have been a string of moments that built up. He didn’t kiss me goodbye like he usually does. He didn’t pull me in for a hug or cuddle even when we had the chance. When we got home, he took a phone call from a female coworker and took it in the bathroom instead of taking a moment with me, which felt especially disconnecting. These things may sound small, but to me, they felt like big emotional absences.\n\nWhen he came out, I told him that I didn’t feel like a priority anymore. He apologised and said he heard me. He ended up feeling horrible about what he’d done, mentioned that even if I forgive him, he may not be able to forgive himself. Some other things were said and that was the end. Until a couple of days later, he asked if I’d be okay with him going to the gym with that same female coworker. I said no. It hurt that I even had to say it, especially after everything I had just opened up about.\n\nThen not long ago, I asked him, “Is she worth losing me over?” That question completely shattered him. I could see it broke something open in him. He said no, absolutely not, but now I don’t know where we go from here. I feel like I’ve been breaking for a while, and he’s starting to realise it.\n\nFor a bit more context, she’s new to the place. Only been around a few months. He’s been helping her adjust as he’s been there for years. According to him, they just hit it off and get along really well. They talk outside of work a lot. Apparently send memes, jokes and what not to each other. Not that I’ve ever seen any of these conversations. \n\nI’m tired of feeling like I’m begging to be seen. I don’t want to be possessive or controlling. I just want to feel chosen, loved in my own language, and emotionally safe.\n\nHow do we rebuild emotional intimacy when it feels like the cracks have already formed? Has anyone come back from a dynamic like this? Any advice or insight would really help.\n\ntl;dr:\nI love my fiancé, but I feel emotionally neglected despite good physical intimacy. After multiple moments where I didn’t feel prioritised, I told him I felt disconnected. When he asked about going to the gym with the same female coworker he had originally put before me, I asked if she was worth losing me over, and it shattered him. Now I’m not sure how to move forward or rebuild emotional safety. Looking for advice or experiences.",

However recently she herself brought it up as an issue, and since then I can't stop worrying about it.\n\nI have a weird thing in relationships, where issues like this make me really anxious and upset. I worry that they are insurmountable and spell the end of the relationship, which I know is an overreaction, but that's how anxiety is.\n\nShe has said it could be her, that she has a tendency to be a dry texter and is bad at conversations, but I don't really think that's the case, since she talks more with other people and has a lot of friends. I do think it could be the combination of both of us being bad at conversation though.

      "content": "I just need to get this out of my chest because I feel like I cannot tell this to anyone clearly because I don't want people to have bad image for him. (He's not bad it's just that our relationship is complicated). He's the most perfect man for me and he gave me evrytg and even more i could get from a relationship. \n\nSo, I've been dating him since I was 17. He's a year older than me. We live in same city. I was in school and he just completed school. We were in same college(different courses) and last year he graduated and i completed my 3rd year just now. Since last year he's working. He went to different cities 2-3 times for a few months and we survived long distance. Later he worked in our city for few months and we were together all the time. (fights like a normal relationship in between). But we knew we had to stick together. \n\nWhat happened recently, is that we got into a fight last month and we're not talking properly since 1 month and few days. Talked in between a few times but that also turned into more arguments. In between this time, he went to another city for job. I wasn't involved in anything and that's why i was feeling very bad because I was there with him evrytime. \nThe last time I talked to him a few days back.. We were talking and i wanted to talk about what caused the fights and how it started and I know it was all his mistake so maybe i was trying to get him accept. Whenever i do he says I've already said sorry about that and I just want to keep bringing up fights. Instead I just wanted acceptance. Actually I said that I don't want to be with him anymore (because i was just tired not because i stopped loving him). And he got angry all of a sudden and when I kept arguing he told me \"I'm in office not at home and I don't have free time to fight only\". That somewhere triggered me. He swore he didn't mean anything wrong just i was arguing him with past one hour. But why we were talking in his office time? Because he said. He said he has to wakeup early and get to bed early as per his new schedule so he won't have time after going home. \n\nI feel like I have fought for this relationship with myself more than I have fought with him. He has been there too. He even called 2-3 times after that but I didn't answer. I know he loved me and maybe still do or not i don't know. But I deleted our pictures in our last month fight and I still somewhere feel ki if evrytg has gone right.. We can have a nice future ahead. I know I'm too young. I know what i have to do and life doesn't stop. But when I see high school couples. I feel like yes even I got that luck where I was loved equally. And in this time genuinely everybody knows how difficult it is to trust anyone. I have invested 4.5 years and he has too. We know each other so well. And tbh i don't have this much time to invest on anyone and i guess i never will. And Noone has in my age. Whatever happened, happend. But it can't happen again. That's why I don't know what to do. Because sometimes I want his support. But it is not in my hand anymore. He's not ready to argue and I can't talk without sorting all the arguments. I have opened my heart and everything in front of him. Maybe it's just not the right time or situation.\n---\n\n**TL;DR;** : I'm confused because me and my partner are not working together anymore because of long distance, differences and fights. Although somewhere we care about each other still. It's a 4.5 year long relationship and I need advice if I should continue or end it. \n\nThank you if you read this far, I would like to read your advices. ",

I almost get the sense she’s hitting on me, I’ve been slowly ramping up my comments as well but nothing concrete from either of us.\n\nWe’ve been really close friends for roughly a decade and I know her values aren’t going to let her make the first bold move.

Are there friends (who eventually turned into couples) out there who simply waited for one person to be ready before actually committing to being in a relationship? Or is this most always a sign that things will not go any further?

He pushes people away and isolates himself.\n\nI have tried to stay strong, even with my abandonment wound ripped wide open each time he gets down.\n\nI have catered to him emotionally and even physically, making sure he eats.

I understood her pain, but I didn’t want to talk about what had happened to me all the time.\n\nThings started to get more intense when Annie decided she wanted to be in the same field as me. Throughout adulthood, Annie has had jobs for a few months here and there, but it ends with her getting fired. She’s trained as a teacher and is good at it, she just loses steam or doesn’t show up. Neither of us had jobs during the beginning of the pandemic, so we put together a virtual camp for tweens who wanted to write. It ended up going okay, though I had to project-manage Annie a lot. Then I got a job offer and didn’t have time anymore. My career field is a blend of tech and creative writing and requires a lot of niche skills. Annie decided she also wanted to join this field when our camp finished, and I encouraged her, but also told her that it would take a lot of work/time/training for her to build up a portfolio. She did do a few spec projects, but none of them went anywhere.\n\nA few years ago, I joined a project that required me to move across the country, which suited me because I couldn’t afford the city any longer (it’s one of the most expensive in the world). Every few months, Annie would text me about jobs, asking if I knew anyone at this or that company. I would usually tell her “no,” even if I did. One of our mutual friends recommended her for a job at his company, and she again lasted a few months before she was placed on a PIP and then fired. I didn’t want to be responsible for the same fiasco. After awhile, Annie’s requests started to really wear on me, and I mostly stopped responding to her.\n\nHere’s the thing. Annie does not need to work because her husband, Matteo, is rich. They live in a high-rise in one of the most expensive neighborhoods of my former city and recently took a weeks-long trip to one of the costliest countries in the world. It’s always been grating to hear Annie complain about not having a job and being broke because she doesn't have to worry about where she'll live. For her, working is a choice, not a necessity. I get that she feels bad with no creative outlet, but she is \\*not\\* broke.\n\nLast weekend was Marybeth’s wedding, so I went back to the city with my partner. We were seated with Marybeth’s best friend, Seth, and Annie. It’s been a rough year for both Seth and Annie. Seth and his college girlfriend Juniper had gotten married, but then they divorced after Juniper cheated. Seth got every single friend in the divorce, even Annie (Juniper's best friend), which is probably some kind of record. Seth has been struggling, and Annie has stepped up to help, though, from what Marybeth's said, it's mostly Annie and Seth mutually trauma-dumping about Juniper. Marybeth asked if it would be chill to seat me with them, since they didn’t know many other people, and I said sure.\n\nIt was not super chill. Annie kept trying to talk to me about how down she was over losing Juniper and not having a job. She didn’t ask me for help getting work this time, but she did talk about how ugly and fat she is, which didn’t make me feel great because we have a similar body type. (Also, Annie is conventionally attractive.) As Annie got drunker, she asked if I was mad at her and that’s why I didn’t answer her messages. She kept repeating that I was a really special friend and she wanted to keep me in her life. We literally hadn’t seen each other for years :/  I kept telling her that we could talk about it after the wedding.\n\nI told her I'd call on Saturday. Tbh, I don’t know if I even should call. I’m thinking I should maybe send her a long text explaining that we have different perspectives on this friendship, and that I wish her the best and I’m so, so glad she has been supportive of Seth, but I feel like she spent years seeing me as a career pathway. Do you think this is the right approach?\n\nTL;DR: college acquaintance says our friendship is really special to her, but I feel like she just wants me for my career connections and I can’t keep doing this.",

The last year has been long-distance, but we’ve been planning for me to move to London after I finish university so we can start our life together. We’re both excited about the future—living together, building a life, and eventually having a family. At least, that’s what I thought.\n\nThe other night, I asked him a hypothetical question: “If I couldn’t have children, would you still want to be with me?” His answer? He’s not sure, because he really wants biological children of his own.\n\nWe’re both healthy as far as we know, and we’re not planning to start a family anytime soon. But his answer hit me hard. Being a mom is something I have a strong desire for, probably even stronger than his. I realized that I would most likely stay with him if the situation were reversed. I’d be open to IVF, adoption. Because to me, being with him matters more than genetics.\n\nThis made me step back and ask: Are we equally committed? I’m getting ready to uproot my entire life—leave behind family, friends, and career opportunities—to be with him in a city I wouldn’t have chosen otherwise. That already feels like a huge personal sacrifice. But now I’m wondering… what if something goes wrong? What if I make this move and he walks away when life throws us a curveball? \n\nIt was honestly an eye-opener. I love him deeply. But if I’m willing to go all in, shouldn’t he be willing to do the same?\n\n\nThe outcome I want:\n I want to continue my life with him, but I need the reassurance that my sacrifices won’t be wasted.\n\nWhen and how should I approach a future conversation about my concerns? \n\nTL;DR:\nBeen with my boyfriend for 3 years, long-distance for the past year.

He said he’s not sure because he wants biological kids. Now I’m questioning whether we’re equally committed and if I should be worried about making such a big move for someone who might not stay through tough times.

      "content": "I’m (21M) writing this because I don’t really know what to do anymore, and I just need to get some of this off my chest.\n\nLately, it feels like my girlfriend (21F) is actively looking for reasons to get annoyed or upset with me. I try to be respectful, caring, and honest with her, but no matter what I do, something seems to always set her off.\n\nOne example that really stuck with me was when a girl at school tried to get my Snapchat. I said, “No sorry, I have a girlfriend,” because I didn’t want to be rude. I told my girlfriend about it because I wanted to be transparent, but instead of appreciating the honesty, she got mad at me for saying \"sorry.\" I tried to explain over and over that I just didn't want to be mean, but she wouldn’t hear it. She ignored me for days and when we were out in public during that time, she started pushing me randomly when people were nearby and yelling things like, “Stop touching me!” or “Get away creep!” It felt like a joke to her, but it was incredibly humiliating for me. She didn’t seem to care.\n\nAnother time, I talked briefly to one of her friends about an assignment we had together. I asked when she thought her part would be done, since mine depended on it. That was it. But when my girlfriend found out, she ghosted me for days. Then I find out she had an 8-hour FaceTime call with one of my friends, someone who clearly has a thing for her and doesnt hide it. When I brought it up, she claimed it was for their school project... but both of them were done with it many days prior, i got that confirmed by their 3rd partner on the project.\n\nShe’s made it clear that I shouldn’t interact with her friends at all, fine, I’ve respected that. But she talks and flirts with my friends constantly, especially one guy who everyone knows is a bit nasty and who has openly flirted with her. She clings to him and jokes around with him all the time, and it just feels like a slap in the face. The double standard is crushing.\n\nI don’t know what I’m asking for, maybe just some perspective. Has anyone been in a relationship like this? How do you even know when it’s time to let go?\n\nThanks for reading if you made it this far. It’s been heavy on my mind for a while.\n\nTL;DR: It’s starting to feel like I’m not allowed to breathe without upsetting her. She gets upset with my for the smallest reasons, there were plenty i didnt write down, trust me. And the worst part is, I still love her so much. But I don’t know if this is healthy. It’s like a loop: she gets annoyed or mad, I get sad and feel unappreciated, and then nothing really gets resolved. I try to show her love, affection, and loyalty every day, but it’s like none of that gets seen.",

      "content": "Hi everyone - I am a 28F and have been dating my 27M boyfriend for a little over 2.5 years now. We moved in together about 10 months and things have been going great. Apart from the usual couple ups and downs, we have a healthy relationship and share a pet together.\n\nWhen we first started dating, we very loosely talked about timelines - I told him I wanted to get engaged around year 3 and married by 4 years together. That seemed like a reasonable plan to him at the time as well. Fast forward to now, I brought up a conversation about potentially getting engaged in the fall at our 3 years, and long story short, he feels reluctant. He has some vague feelings about not being ready, wanting to wait till year 4 to get engaged, etc. We got into an argument about it and I ascertained that he has a lot of anxiety about the future and struggles to look ahead and feel excited about the future. I am a huge planner and look forward to milestones in my life, whereas he takes life more “day-by-day”.  There is a chance we might be long distance next year because of our careers, and he mentioned that this gives him sadness and anxiety and he’s just in general not looking towards things changing.\n\nI’ve told him multiple times that I’m not interested in being someone’s long term girlfriend, I want more, I’m excited about being married to him and starting a life together. I also told him that I am not planning on waiting around forever and will end the relationship at some point if marriage isn’t in the picture. After talking a lot, we’ve agreed to be engaged by the end of 2025. Last time we spoke, he said “I’m coming around more to the idea of that” which made me feel bad. Originally I was glad to at least have some reassurance that it was going to happen this year, but now I’m feeling resentful and frustrated and like I pressured him. He’s not brought up engagement ring shopping at all on his own and continues to never bring up the subject. I realized that while I was initially happy that we discussed getting engaged this year, I am starting to get scared that he still might not be ready and I may get some version of a “shut-up ring” on December 31st. I know he loves me and wants to be with me, I trust that he is true about his feelings, but I don’t trust that he is capable of taking the next step. I am scared I am pressuring him into this and that I would feel unsatisfied even if it did happen because it wasnt his own autonomous decision.\n\nI’m starting to feel resentful even in our happy moments together. Whenever we are relaxing or cuddling and he’s telling me how much he’ll miss me when I travel for work, I can’t help but think “you love me and our life but you don’t want to get married.” And it makes me resent him. I’ve been trying to start couples therapy to talk about this but haven’t found an available appointment yet. I really don’t know how to cope with these feelings and I would appreciate any insight or experiences that might be similar.\n\nTLDR: My (28F) boyfriend (27M) of 2.5 years “not ready”/ “coming around to” the idea of engagement this year but I am feeling resentful that he hasn’t taken any steps towards doing so and anxious that I have pressured him and don’t know how to cope",

At first he kept chasing me until he made me love him (we were working together) but I left the country and it became long distance relationship. 5 months into the relationship I told him we have to end this bc it’s not going anywhere. He kept saying don’t say this again and we don’t know what the future holds for us and that even if we didn’t end up together we can still enjoy a a few good years together. It doesn’t make sense ik but I fell for that but I was trying not to get too attached because I knew it’s going to end sooner or later. I was back in the country with him for 4 months then I left again (he already knew from the start it’s going to be long distance bc I can’t stay long everytime I go)….\n\neverything was cool until this girl appeared in his life, shes married but going through divorce and she has feelings for my bf (hes the one who told me and he got to know from a mutual friend) I asked him not to hang out with her as it really bothers me and I don’t feel comfortable at allllll esp that I’m not physically present. At first he said ok he’ll stop but he didn’t. She goes to his place and they drink and smoke together. He doesn’t like her thats for sure and he’s been even trying to ghost her and not text her back when she asks him to go over to his place and she was crying to my other friend because she felt like hes ignoring her. So hes not into her whatsoever but his reasoning is that he feels lonely since im not there and he only has 1 close friend thats always busy. He was hiding that they hang out until I found out when she was talking to my friend over the phone about that. But ofc I was suspicious bc of the way he was acting.\n\nAnyway 1 week after this drama he told me he doesn’t wanna be with me anymore bc of sth I did but it was sth sooo stupid, until now I’m not convinced it really annoyed him but my perspective is that he got bored bc I was always questioning him abt that girl bc he was acting weird!!! I’m not paranoid!!! And my doubts came true at the end when I found out they were hanging out almost everyday. Anyway I said ok fine and I stopped texting him at all, like at first I tried to apologize hoping that it really annoyed him but he wasn’t listening and wanted to end things. Then 3 weeks later he called me apologizing and saying I really love and miss you but I was annoyed by you questioning me all the time.\n\nAnd we’re back together but I’m still so hurt. I feel like he’s never been genuine with me from the way he handled the situation, the way he was talking to me calling me hypocrite and liar (only during our last fight….he never treated me this way before), telling that gurl I don’t see a future with her (it’s true that we have no future but lately hes been telling me that he’ll try to fix everything so that we can get married bc he loves me and he never said that we have no future so by him saying that and to that gurl made me feel tht he doesn’t care abt me at alll and it feels like hes talking shit abt me) also my friend told me that this girl told her that they kissed and hugged I’m soooo hurt. N.B: I have some issues that will hold me from going to where he is for the next maybe 9 months and maybe more so it’s making things harder….QUESTION: why did he start talking to me again??? Hes been ghosting her and she calls my friend and cries to her bc of that….what tf is happening?? I need analysis to that….hes calling me everyday now exactly like before as if nothing happened….but I’m 100% sure she still comes over and they hang out but he still hides it…why??? Is this normal bc we’re long distance so it’s fine that he hangs out with her a lot???? I’m so hurt and feel unappreciated\n\nTL;DR: hes been hanging out with another girl bc we’re long distance….does that justify it??",

      "content": "TL;DR - my partner of 5 years (27m) and I (26f) agreed on vacation dates for two separate trips. I got the days wrong on both requiring changing time off work and asking family to move their trip dates to accommodate. Meanwhile partner is all upset over the stress of it and it still not being perfectly the way we planned. Can’t make everyone happy, but how can I forgive myself?\n\n\nThis just feels totally fucked and I need advice on how to forgive myself and move on here. Basically we planned two trips to the shore in June. Family has a house we can use. I thought we confirmed the dates but I guess I got it mixed up in my mind and missed a day for one and took off work for the entirely wrong week on the other, also missed a day on the weeklong one. So when my partner heard this he got extremely upset because these vacations are “all he’s working for” right now. Which is understandable. I said I would fix it. I work a job where it’s difficult to get time off, so I had to go back to my employers and beg nicely to be off on an extra day where they really needed me. That worked out without too much trouble, but I still feel shitty making them rearrange their schedules for me.\n\nNext, our weeklong vacation (that I planned for the wrong week) ended up then overlapping with the only time my dad can get to the house in June. He planned his trip after I already claimed my dates though. Partner is upset about this because it doesn’t feel like a vacation with a parent around. Okay fine. I ask my dad to change his departure time, which he does but not so that it fully avoids overlap. So now I feel like everyone is losing. I feel like a total POS. Dad probably feels like I hate him and don’t want to see him but I just want to have my own time like we planned. Partner is still upset because the beginning of the vacation is tainted by another person being present. I likely cant switch to being off work to the correct week we originally planned on going to avoid overlap because of aforementioned difficulty for my employers being able to cover me. But I did ask to find out if it’s possible, which makes me feel even worse because I already did this once with the other trip. \n\nI feel like such shit about all this I am afraid I won’t even be able to enjoy the trips because of everything I had to fuck up to get there. I want to cry and stay home and never try to go anywhere or take off work ever again. Help. ",

There have been multiple instances over the last year where he is either overstimulated or stressed out and if i say something wrong in these moments he gets snippy with me. One of the first times I pointed it out, we had a gathering at his mom’s house for a game night and he was upset he was losing a game. I cheered on his mom and told him he could do .. xyz .. to better his chances and he abruptly in a raised voice said “stop talking to me”. I was shocked because I couldn’t believe he’d take a tone like that with me especially infront of his family. I felt extremely embarrassed and just stopped talking the rest of the night. I brought up to him the way I felt and he apologized profusely saying he just gets competitive and caught up in games. \n\nThere have been multiple instances where he abruptly just has a mood switch but I’ve brushed them off. Recently it was my birthday and we were driving in a city. I am originally from a big city and am used to the driving & I suggested I drive but he insisted so I let him. I accidentally told him to get in the wrong lane and he cut someone off to go where I told him and had to get back over. He said “ugh now I look like an asshole”. I told him it’s fine everyone makes a wrong turn here and there and everyone is an asshole to someone. I did make a following comment that he was bumper to bumper with another car because I was worried about them braking hard and us rear ending them. After I made the comment he snapped at me and yelled “can you just let me drive?” I was very upset and my emotions got the best of me so i started tearing up because I was sad it was my birthday and he was ruining my mood & I just stopped talking. He did apologize later that day. \n\nWe’ve had multiple conversations about how I don’t want to be talked to that way by my partner and he always says he’s working on himself and trying. \n\nI do appreciate the apologies but just saying sorry after being mean to me is not cutting it for me. He is working on himself in therapy and I am proud that he is but I don’t want to be on the receiving end of his outbursts. It’s getting harder for me to move past them even after apologies. I’m not sure how to bring this up without discrediting his work in therapy. ",

      "content": "My boyfriend(25M) and I (23F) have been together for almost a year. Sometimes he says “I need to have complete control over everything at all times or else I get upset.” Through our relationship I never could see him as controlling, however being almost a year together i’ve really started to learn that he tries to be very emotionally manipulative with getting me to do things. I recently had a colposcopy done (NOT A COLONOSCOPY). We had plans to go watch a movie, I didn’t think about how I would feel after the procedure. I was taking my dog outside to use the bathroom (morning after procedure) I started feeling a lot of pain and muscle weakness. I went to my BF and said “I don’t think I’m going to be able to go to the movies with you I just started feeling like sh*t from the procedure.” He pulled his t shirt over his head and got mad. He was upset because he had already bought the tickets and said he couldn’t get a refund. I apologized and said I will pay him the money back. Then, I went to take a hot shower to try and relieve some of the pain I was having. After the shower, I went in our room to get into comfy clothes. He comes in and says,  “Are you almost ready? We have to be there in like 20min.”  I said, “I told you how I was feeling and I really don’t think I can go to the movies right now.” I suggested for him to go watch the movie so he would just lose the money for my ticket, as he wanted to see this movie as much as I did. He got very upset, left our room and I heard him punch something in the kitchen. I laid down and about 30min later he comes back in our room and says, “I was able to get my money back.” I said “That’s great, I’m sorry because I didn’t expect to be in this much discomfort.” He didn’t say much so we brushed it off and  proceeded on with the day. This is just one of the times this type of situation has happened. It happens often, is this him emotionally trying to control/manipulate me? How can I put an end to him doing this to me? \n\n\nTL;DR —\nI (23F) feel as if my BF (25M) of almost a year is very manipulative/controlling, emotionally with me. He plays with my feelings and emotions very often. Above is one of the situations that happened recently. How do I put an end to him doing this to me?\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "TL;DR: trying to reconcile a second time with my ex boyfriend. He doesnt know what he wants and wants to take it slow and actively refusing to make any future plans. I'm trying to figure out if he's stringing me along. No kissing or sex but lots of sentimental moments, consistent communication, and dates\n\nI (41F) dated my boyfriend (36M) for less than a year and we had planned to spend our lives together. He moved across the country to be closer to me and bought some property to build on. At a certain point he became very cold and distant because he began resenting me as he fixed up his property and I began detaching over his change of personality. We broke up and didnt speak for a couple of months and during this time he tried very hard to get in contact with me. Finally we tried to reconcile but I was angered by him reconnecting with his ex girlfriend while we were apart and their growing emotional connection as we were trying to patch things up. So we quickly ended things again. I thought about my anger and realized I was coming from a place of control and jealousy. He has been apologetic, and is now in therapy. We have forgiven each other. I love him and want to continue our path together. I contacted him three weeks later and he was at my door in an instant. We are being very cautious and he has explicitly stated that he hasn't made up his mind about what he wants, either to jump back in or move on. He has refused to kiss me or have sex because he wants to \"take it slow\", but we have been physically loving and close without hesitation. It's been two weeks since we've been back in contact and have been on several dates, expressed our love for each other, and made very near future plans. We have also mutually agreed to be exclusive. He keeps saying we need to stay in the present and refuses to plan anything too far in the future with me. Our communication is open and consistent. He has asked me to be patient with him while we navigate our relationship, but everything seems so vague and uncertain on his part. It's been wonderful taking things slow but I am missing the passionate aspect of our relationship- kissing and sex. He knows this and is very adamant that it is because he wants to let it \"happen organically\" Can anyone shed light on this? Is he stringing me along or is this typically of a guarded man dipping his toe back into a relationship with someone he describes as his \"favorite person\" whom he loves unconditionally.",

Obviously, I'm on edge because when is she coming to get her things? I think it's part of her controlling nature. Also, I cannot just throw her things to the curb legally. I'll have to get a storage unit and move the things for 14 days to the unit to protect myself legally (if she doesn't get her things.)\n\nI know that if I email her, she'll just ignore the email but at this point I really just wish she could communicate.

      "content": "Hello everyone\n\nPlease help, I would really appreciate the help. Have been together for 6 months about to go into 7. Dating for 5 months going into 6. \n\nI truly love this women. I’m trying to figure out how to support my girlfriend the right way without smothering her, overwhelming her, or making her feel like she has to be okay. A few days ago, we had a really honest conversation. She told me she’s been feeling emotionally numb. That she’s lost her spark. And that even when we’re together, sometimes she still feels alone. That hit hard—not because I took it personally, but because I love her and I don’t want her to feel like that, especially not with me. I’m not trying to fix her. I’m not trying to force anything. I just want to be steady, present, and supportive. I know I have my own flaws and I really.\n\nLast night we FaceTimed before bed and she said “I love you” multiple times before falling asleep. Today she was joking with me and laughing, and hearing that laugh meant the world to me. It reminded me that the connection is still there, even if things feel off. I know she’s drained. I can feel it. And I’ve been doing these from the beginning taking her out on dates when I can, writing her love letters, bringing her flowers just because. I don’t do those things to fix her mood. I do them because I want her to feel loved.\n\nThis situation made me realize how much I need to grow. I don’t want to love her with empty words or promises I want to love her with action. I want to change as a man. I want to be more emotionally available. I want to be more thoughtful, more intentional, more grounded. I don’t want to lose her, and I’m not just saying that. I’m doing the inner work.\n\n* How do I keep showing up in a way that gives her peace, not pressure?\n* How can I stay emotionally connected to her when she’s feeling so disconnected from herself?\n* What are the quiet things that matter most to someone who’s going through emotional numbness?\n\nIf you have ever been on either side of this feeling numb yourself, or loving someone who is your advice means a lot.\n\nI’m not here to fix her. I genuinely love this women and I know as a man I need to step up but I am unsure of what to do and how to do it. I know I need to be more present when spending time with her. I really want this women to feel like she on top of the world and truly want her to glow with love and not make her feel like her spark is lost in herself because shes trying to keep the peace in the relationship.\n\nPlease help, I really would appreciate the help. I am afraid to lose this women and I really want to change and truly show her with actions that I love her. I know I am loyal to her and keep my heart loyal to her and always give assurances and communicate, as well as tell her she has a safe space to talk about her feelings.\n\nI know I need to be more present when we spend time together. I really dont want her to feel alone when we are together. Always try to listen to her and stop trying to give solutions to problems. Im afraid to lose this women.\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nMy girlfriend recently told me she feels emotionally numb and disconnected—even when we’re together.

I’m scared of losing her, and I’m asking for advice on how to love her the right way through this.",

      "title": "Do I give him a second chance?",
      "content": "This is gonna be a long one but here’s the context to the situation first:\n\nMy (25f) fiancé (26m) told me that he’s not attracted to me and doesn’t love me anymore. We have been together for 4 years, lived together for 3, and everything had been great until a few months back. He stopped doing little things for me like giving me a kiss before leaving for work (something he had done every morning since we started dating) and when I asked him about it the first time he said he forgot the past few mornings because he’s been stressed about work etc. Then when I brought it up again, he told me he felt like it was too much effort. At this point, I was concerned because this was very out of character for him. I honestly thought he was falling into a depression and wrote off a lot of what was going on because we had three years of him being considerate and loving. There were definitely signs in the past few months, but I didn’t think it was because he didn’t love me anymore.\n\nHe started acting hyper critical towards me, commenting on everything I did wrong, telling me everything I do is wrong, etc. It hit a boiling point when we were driving home from his family’s and he looked like he was going to be sick (he ended up having a severe migraine which we found out after I took him to the hospital). The reason I took him to the hospital is because he started swearing at me on the way home (something he had never done before). It scared me. I told the nurses and doctors about it, thinking it was a symptom of some kind of medical emergency. Later, on the drive home, he told me to stop telling people that he swore at me because they would think he was abusive. I told him that I wouldn’t stop telling people and if it wasn’t a symptom then it was not okay and if he ever did that again I would leave him. In retrospect, that’s when he started to become way more distant. Nothing I did was good enough. If I cooked supper, it was overdone, if I cleaned the house, I forgot to fold a blanket, I couldn’t do something good without him commenting on something that wasn’t quite right. I confronted him about this and he was apologetic but it started back up again pretty soon after.\n\nFinally, I sat him down and asked what was going on. He acted like he didn’t know what I was talking about. I went through everything that had been going on and he just sat there in silence. I asked him if he had any kind of response or reasoning behind this and he just said “I dunno”. I should have taken this as his answer, but I genuinely thought he had something going on. I just wanted to support him. After a long discussion, we went through things that he needed to change and things that I could do to support him. We also decided to go camping as a way to try to rekindle things.\n\nWe went camping this past weekend and it was fun. Something was off about him all weekend but when I asked, he told me it was nothing and he was just trying to enjoy himself. So I left it. I didn’t push and just tried to have a nice time. Once we got back and had finished cleaning up, he came and sat down on the couch next to me. He asked me what I thought about camping and I told him I enjoyed myself but that something seemed off about him. That’s when he told me that he wasn’t sure about us. He told me he’s not attracted to me anymore and he’s not sure if he loves me. A very long, very emotional conversation ensued where I kept asking him to clarify things and he kept answering “I dunno”. He told me he hasn’t been attracted to me in a while and that I’m not sexy enough. I haven’t gained any weight or really changed anything about myself physically and so I asked him what about me he was no longer attracted to and he couldn’t give me an answer. He told me there was just something missing. Finally, I asked him if he still loved me and he said he didn’t think so. I looked and him and said “so things are over?” And he said “yeah”. He slept on the couch that night and left for work early. \n\nI spent the entire next day completely broken. I have never felt that kind of hurt before. I sobbed all day and couldn’t get myself to stop. I spent the day with family and they helped me get my thoughts together. We planned out what I would say and do for pretty much any scenario. The only way I would let myself give him a chance is if he apologized profusely, initiated going to therapy and recognized everything wrong with himself and what he did. All of this without any prompting from me. Well, that’s exactly what happened and more. I had never seen him so broken. \nHe told me that everything he said was a mistake and not true. That he was afraid of marriage and didn’t know how to confront that. He told me he was looking for a therapist that specialized in family trauma and attachment styles and that he would do anything for a chance to try and fix things. I told him that we could try to fix things but that I had no guarantee that I’d be able to move past what happened. That only time would tell. I told him the wedding was still off, that we were no longer engaged, and that the relationship is taking a major step back. That we’re not just starting up where we left off. \n\nNow I’m torn. I love him, but I also recognize that love isn’t enough. I do believe that this was a major wake up for him and that he will follow through with everything he said. But I’m just so embarrassed. I’m cancelling things like my wedding dress and the venue and I feel so lost. I want things to work out, but either way I’m embarrassed about a failed engagement and failed wedding. If we hadn’t been engaged, this wouldn’t be so public and I think it would have been a lot easier to deal with. But my family, his family, and friends all know about this and that’s what I hate the most. I hate having my personal life and struggles out there for everyone to judge. The worst part for me is that the embarrassment is there whether we work things out or not. So how the hell do I come back from this?\n\nTLDR: He broke up with me, realized it was a mistake and is now making steps to fix everything. The wedding is off and I’m embarrassed.",

Whenever I tell her no to things, she pressures me into going, and her reasoning is, “You’re an adult they can’t tell you what to do.” I know better than to rebel against my parents like that because I respect their rules. Just recently, I got into a car crash at night, and it makes me a bit scared to drive at night, and my parents also don’t want me to drive at night for a while due to me getting into the crash. My friend wants to make plans again but at night, and I told her that I can’t go due to being back with my parents and my fear of driving at night. She disregarded these concerns by saying, “Girl, you’re 19, and everyone has gotten into a crash it’s not that deep.” It’s so frustrating because whenever I try to explain, she always does this. How can I explain to her that when you have strict parents and you’re back at their house, you follow their rules because it’s not your house?",

      "content": " The start of our relationship was not easy, it took 5 months for us to be able to have sex because he was very shy at first and then he had to get surgery on his penis. That created some tension, but after those 5 months our relationship was heaven. I truly felt love, I felt energetic, safe, calm... It became the healthy relationship I've always dreamt of. We were a team, our days were filled with support, sweet thoughts and kisses. I've never been that happy. Unfortunately this lasted only for four months. As his mother got sick, he started being distant, which felt normal as first, after all his mother was sick and the only important thing was to take care of her. I made sure I was being helpful, I still cook healthy meals for his mother, I text her frequently, researched doctors and the best exercises to keep her moving. However, she is a piece of work ( very controlling, jealous of me, very possessive) and I did vent about her to my Fiancé... She would criticise my cooking, constantly telling me what to do. She told her ADULT son he couldn't go on a trip with me because he had to work. Worst thing that happened is that I left my suitcase at her house (my fiancé was still living with her) and she went through my clothes and washed some of them. That felt like a violation of my privacy, so I asked my Fiancé to move in together, after all he had already proposed to me because things were just amazing. I assume that this \"request\" and the occasional venting convinced him that his mother and I were antagonists and that he had to choose between us. So he started defending his mother aggressively, for example he shouted at me when I asked if he could tell his mother not to call more than once when we are on holidays together. But we were still looking for apartments, he feel in love with this one apartment and convinced me to rent it with him. So we did. After that he started telling me I forced him to move in together, that he feels suffocated and can never see his friends (I have never once told him not to see his friends). He eventually realised that I never forced him to do anything, but he stopped being thoughtful and kind, stopped touching me and making plans with me. he acts like he does not care, sometimes he does not even look at me. It hurts like hell because I felt in bones like he was the one for me and he is not the same man anymore. I am still supporting him, I am never leaving his side, I take good care of him and his mother by giving them all the love I have. Please, I you found yourself in similar situation, I need your advice. I feel like I lost him and I am loosing myself as well.\n\n  \nTLDR: My Fiancé (M27) has been distant for about 3 months now. We have been together for a year now. His Mother (F59) was diagnosed with cancer 8 months ago. ",

If anyone is able to suggest me something, I would really appreciate it.\n\n**TL;DR;: Any ideas what should i gift her?**.",

      "content": "Hi Reddit,\nMy boyfriend (28M) and I (24F) have been together for several years. Lately, I’ve noticed that I’ve completely lost interest in sex. It just doesn’t feel exciting or fulfilling anymore, more like something I go along with, but don’t actively desire.\n\nWhat’s confusing is that I am still very attracted to him. I think he’s really good-looking, and I love being close to him, kissing, cuddling, touching, just spending time together. There’s still affection and emotional connection. I don’t feel like we’ve fallen out of love or anything.\n\nIt also isn’t about wanting someone else, I don’t feel turned on by anyone, and I don’t fantasize about being with other people. It’s not about boredom or missing excitement. It’s more like the whole idea of sex just doesn’t feel appealing to me anymore. I miss wanting it, but the desire just isn’t there.\n\nI haven’t talked to him about this in detail yet, because I don’t want him to feel rejected or unattractive, which he isn’t. But I’m starting to feel confused and a bit worried. I don’t want this to create distance between us, but I also don’t know how to “fix” something I don’t understand.\n\nHas anyone else gone through something similar? Is this just a phase, or something deeper? I’d really appreciate hearing others' perspectives or advice.\n\nThanks in advance. 💬\n\nTL;DR:\nI (24F) love my boyfriend (28M) and still find him attractive, but I’ve completely lost interest in sex, not just with him, but in general. I miss the desire and don’t know how to get it back. Looking for advice from others who’ve experienced this.",

      "content": "So my gf and I have been dating for a year and 4 months and lately I've been feeling kinda depressed, sad, and emotionless especially with my gf and I hate it. I want to be able to have those same feelings back again as I used to have and I've been trying. I take her out on dates, do activities together, go out to bars, get high, and stuff but just the feeling isn't coming back. We went out to this club on Saturday it was like emo night which had a lot of the music that we like (it wasn't really emo music, it was more punk, rock, metal, and some emo music) and she would always be holding me or holding my hand but for some reason I was getting annoyed? Like I just wanted to enjoy the music and dance without her holding me every 5 seconds.\n\nI've been starting to realize that besides some same music taste, some same food tastes, drinking, smoking weed, we don't have a lot in common. I like to have deeper conversations and like to kinda analyze things and talk about them with my partner but when I try to do that, she just listens and doesn't provide a lot of input, I mean she does sometimes but a lot of the time she just ends the conversation. A lot of our conversations are surface level and only deep conversations we have are about her dreams. I feel like I'm not being challenged at all. Maybe it's the fact that we are in different stages of life? Idk because I have a career as a nurse and she's still a server at a restaurant so sometimes it's kinda hard to talk about things that happen at work you know?\n\nI also work 6 days a week so when I'm not at work I'm with her so it does take a bit of a toll since I don't have a lot of time for myself. We like some of the same shows/movies but it's hard to find A LOT of shows/movies we both like so sometimes it does bother me and it feels like I'm not able to enjoy the things I like since I'm always with her if not at work and feel like I'm expected to do things with her only. We do go out to casinos (which sometimes I get annoyed cause she spends a lot on keno sometimes and wants me to play with her which I don't mind but she spends a lot and when I say I'm done and don't wanna take out anymore, she would take out money from her own account so I can play with her but I feel bad when she does it and always deny it but she gets upset so I end up feeling bad of her getting upset that I'm like fine and take it out my account or just sometimes be okay with her money), we go to bars (which also have keno so we always play when we go out to bars haha) and we go out to dinner or breakfast or we just stay in.\n\nShe does do a lot for me which I'm super grateful for. She likes to cook for me, surprise me with dessert, supports me, and is very loving which I love about her but I can't shake this emotionless feeling I've been having around her and it's really taking a toll on me. I'm feeling depressed. I do fantasize about being single as well which I don't like either. I hate this feeling and I feel like a POS for feeling this way. She's always saying she loves me, she misses me, and says a lot of sweet things to me but I'm just indifferent about it sometimes and say it back just to say it back. Idk if it's the fact that I need time for myself or this is me falling out of love. I honestly don't know if I can get those feelings I once had with her before. \n\nTL:DR: think I'm falling out of love for my gf and I hate it. Idk what to do if we should break up or try to get that spark again. We're just two different people in different stages of life and it is starting to eat me up. I'm often fantasizing about being single and idk if this is normal or a phase I'm going through. I feel bad and a POS for thinking like this...",

      "content": "Okay so I’ve (19M) been talking with this friend (19F) for about 4 or 5 years now through instagram. The origin story is that I saw her regularly at a weekly social event, thought she was cool, but never really talked with her much. Months after moving away to Chicago, I reached out to her on a total whim. I didn’t have much confidence that she would answer, as we honestly didn’t know each other very much, but she did. \n\nCut to today. We talk roughly once every three months, just making casual conversation. She has a lovely boyfriend. To be clear, we were never anything romantic, and what little romantic interest I had entertained before is long gone. There’s no honest way it would work out. But she’s still a blast to talk to, and I’m generally pretty isolated otherwise so I sort of cling to bygone people. \n\nThe question that’s weighing on me is why the hell does she stick with me, too?\n\nI feel like any other person in her position would have ghosted me by now. But she likes all my posts, has hearted many of my messages recently(and when I pointed it out she playfully pouted and teased me back), and often replies within the day. \n\nBut the real tipping point, the catalyst behind this whole post here today, is this: I was looking for any kind of clue that she may have had a crush on me. We follow each other on Spotify, which I rarely even use, but I scanned through her playlists there… on a few separate lists, I noticed a wave of songs with bittersweet lyrics (conveying people drifting away, someone you find comfort in, unrequited feelings, frustration) that were added on dates that directly aligned with dates we had wrapped up a conversation on. Obviously it could be coincidental, and she’s in an amazing relationship elsewhere that I have no intention of spoiling, but I secretly sort of hope those songs are about me. \n\nDo you think that I should confront her about my suspicions? Should I be straight to the point or ease into it more naturally? I just plan on asking, “Why did you choose to stay with me after all this time? Is it because you’re lonely, clinging on to the past, or something else?”\n\nTL;DR I think that a long-distance friend has had romantic feelings for me but never said anything about it. I feel like I have positive signals, but I want outside reassurance and am worried about being wrong. I don’t want to drift apart on a bitter note… I just want to make it clear between us. ",

I now know that what I was experiencing was feeling wanted for the very first time, that maybe someone really COULD be interested in me. But I didn’t feel fireworks, and it didn’t feel like falling in love with him would be this inevitable thing. It felt awkward, forced almost. Any other experience I had before then was at most 7 or 8 different first dates organized via dreaded dating apps. All of these first date connections were ended by me. \n\nAnd then after my first and only situationship ended, I met them (22NB). The light of my life, someone that I never would have met if not for some completely unrelated, coincidental, shared glances.  \n\nAnd wow. Fireworks. The best, most beautiful, wonderful fireworks I’ve ever seen. But also the scariest. It’s a slightly terrifying feeling, like my life will never be the same again; like my life will permanently be entwined with theirs, but in the best way possible. \n\nThough I think what makes it a bit scarier is that I am aware of my naïveté due to my lack of experience. But each and every time I step back and think further on it I’m met with the same overwhelming, ever so sure feeling that I am going to fall in love with them; that I want to be theirs, and them to be mine. \n\nEverything feels so secure, so right, so safe. It really is very easy to be there for them, to do better for them, to communicate with them. And it’s even easier to want to do all of those things. \n\nTL;DR: I have little to no experience with dating, and have never been in a relationship before this. But now I’m on the path to falling in love for the first time at 22, with someone I started dating 2 months ago. ",

A few weeks ago, I found signs he had downloaded things from porn websites. I asked him about it, and he insisted they were from before we met. He told me he hadn’t watched porn in years.

We’re both 19 and currently sophomores in college. Things between us have been great, but there’s a serious issue with how she and my family (especially my parents and brother) get along — or rather, don’t get along.\n\nThe latest problem started on Easter. She came over to my parents’ house, brought a gift, dressed nicely, and made conversation during dinner. After she left, my parents told me they thought she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my older brother. They said she rolled her eyes every time he spoke and that she’s done this for years (though I honestly haven’t noticed that). They also said she came off as cold and dismissive toward them.\n\nMy girlfriend was shocked to hear that. From her perspective, she’s always tried to be polite, and she feels like my parents never really liked her and are constantly looking for reasons to dislike her. Because of that, she no longer feels comfortable coming over. She thinks anything she does will be twisted into something negative.\n\nNow my parents are asking for an apology from her. It’s been about a month and she hasn’t apologized, because she doesn’t feel like she did anything wrong. Meanwhile, my parents say they’re losing what little respect they had for her, and it’s clear they don’t want her around until she “makes things right.”\n\nSo now I’m stuck. I love her and want this relationship to work, but I also want peace with my family. I hate this tension, and it’s hard feeling like I have to pick a side. I’ve tried talking to both sides, but neither is budging. I don’t even know what a “solution” looks like anymore.\n\nIf anyone’s been through something like this or has advice on how to move forward, I’d really appreciate it.\n\nTL;DR:\nMy girlfriend and I have been dating for 2 years, but she and my parents don’t get along. After Easter dinner, my parents said she was rude and disrespectful, especially to my brother. She says they’ve never liked her and now refuses to go over. My parents want an apology, she refuses, and I’m stuck in the middle trying to keep the peace. Not sure what to do.\n",

She had apparently understood that to be a breakup talk, and I wasn’t aware that’s what it was. I thought that if I held out a little longer, eventually we’d be able to reconnect and start spending more time together again. When we met next a few weeks later, something felt wrong. I can’t explain it, but my body was telling me something was wrong. Over the next few weeks she stopped sharing her location with me and hid her relationship status on Facebook.\n\nThis past weekend, I finally sent her a message explaining my need to move on with my life, that I couldn’t just sit in misery anymore, but my hope that we could reconnect when she was ready. I still love her, and sending that message was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. She understood and was sorry that I had been feeling the way I had been feeling.\n\nWhat I discovered this weekend is that Instagram now has a feature where you can see what your friends like on reels. And the posts that’s she’s liked recently (I checked when they were posted) are all about having a new relationship and how “he” makes you feel and a whole lot of other suggestive stuff. Am I overreacting to be thinking that she has been seeing someone else already, despite telling me that she had no capacity to date anyone and that she viewed me as the only person she would ever want to be with?\n\nMy overthinking about this has kept me up for the past several nights. I haven’t been able to get a full nights sleep since I realized this was something I could see. If she didn’t want to be with me, I wish she would have just flat out told me that and not left me in this state. I don’t even know what I’m doing posting this here, just needed to vent to the void I guess.\n\ntl;dr - How do I combat my overthinking about someone I love telling me they can’t support a relationship with me when I suspect they may have already moved on with someone else?",

      "title": "Feeling like I (29F) am outgrowing my partner (37M)… terrified and need advice",
      "content": "***TW: Mentions of eating disorders***\n\n*tl;dr: feeling like I'm outgrowing my partner of five years, who hasn't done anything wrong; needing advice or perspective!*\n\nHi everyone, I’m really struggling and could use some advice. I want to start by saying my partner (37M) is a kind, supportive, and wonderful person, and I (29F) love him like family. But I’m starting to question if that’s all there is to being in a relationship, and I’m terrified about it. I want to emphasise that he hasn’t done anything *wrong*, but something feels off, and I’m hoping for clarity.\n\nWe’ve been together for five years, but we met at work when I was 22. We got together at the start of the pandemic, and with strict COVID restrictions where I live, we got used to seeing each other just once a week, so the years kind of blurred together. \n\nDuring that time, I developed a severe eating disorder and became a shell of a human being, so the next two years from 2022 - 2024 felt like another blur. He was incredibly supportive through my recovery, and I’ll always be grateful for that, which is why I feel so incredibly guilty for how I’ve been feeling.\n\nHere are the things that are nagging at me:\n\n**1. Physical intimacy**: Somewhere around the 3 year mark, I stopped wanting physical contact. This coincided with my eating disorder (which can cause that) so I brushed it off. But even after full recovery, any sort of prolonged touch makes me uncomfortable. I started to wonder whether I might just be fully asexual, but going out and talking to people made me realize I *can* feel attraction…it’s just not happening with him. I want to stress that I have not met anyone else; it’s more that these interactions made me feel *interesting* again, something I haven’t felt in a while. I fully understand that this is normal in long-term relationships, but I can't help but wonder what it's like to be physically attracted to someone.\n\n**2. Feeling disconnected**: He’s so kind and supportive, but every conversation either feels really shallow or one-sided. We have banter and it’s *fun,* but when we talk about anything serious I feel like I’m talking *at* him, not *with* him. This is also the reason why we don’t fight - he rarely contributes to the conversation. and when I repeat something later, it’s always like he’s hearing it for the first time, which makes me feel unheard. If I ask him to express his thoughts he will literally just tell me he has none, which brings me to the next point.\n\n**3. How passive he is**: The biggest issue came when he quit his job after years of resenting it. I’m proud of him for choosing happiness, but he has never once spoken up about the unfair workloads. Not once. He just let the resentment build up and took it all in until he couldn’t anymore. This is a pattern: he will get upset but won’t voice his feelings or act, even after I’ve asked/encouraged/begged him to. It feels like he’s stuck in a cycle he won’t break, and I worry it’ll continue in a new job.\n\nThis is something that extends outside of work. Once, a stranger shoved me hard, and he did nothing. He didn’t say a word. And when I wanted to address it, he held me back. I understand wanting to avoid confrontation/trouble, but it really bothered me that he made it seem like a me problem.\n\nAnother time, someone took our paid seats at the theatre, and he suggested we just sit elsewhere. I handled it and got the seats back, but it was frustrating. I’m fully capable of standing up for myself, but I want a partner I know I can rely on to step up too, if that makes sense.\n\nWhen I think about the future, I panic that I can’t count on him to make decisions or advocate for me, or us as a unit. This makes me feel so guilty because he’s technically done nothing “wrong,” and I love him like family. He’s still the same kind and thoughtful person, and seeing him feels like being at home. But I’m scared I’m outgrowing him, and I don’t know what to do.\n\nHas anyone felt this way? How did you navigate it? I’d appreciate any advice or perspective. Thank you!",

      "title": "I (23m)am having trouble feeling love from my (23f) girlfriend",
      "content": "I (23M) have been together with my girlfriend (23F) for a little over a year now. Like any other relationships we have our own ups and downs but overall it’s been great, at least for me. Ever since the start of 2025, I always had this feeling of she’s just using me for money or to do things for her. I don’t mind spending money on her or helping her with tasks but over the 1 year+ I don’t feel like she would have done the same.\n\nCouple weeks ago I asked her a hypothetical question, “if I suddenly go broke/bankrupt would you still be with me?” Her answer seemed logical at first but I still felt a little hurt. She said “well if that happens I’ll probably stay for maybe 3 months to see if you’ll get more money again, if you don’t then I’ll probably leave”.\n\nAnother incident happened 2 weeks ago where she went out for dinner with this guy “A” and 2 other male friends. I don’t have anything against her seeing other old male friends as long as it isn’t 1 on 1. To provide more context, my girlfriend used to have a thing for “A” and she told me about it before. At first when she told me about this dinner I was uncomfortable and I told her about it. But she insisted on going and hesitantly invited me to go to “make me feel better”.\n\nFast forward to the day of the dinner, she only told me the general location of the restaurant and told me to wait for them. I had ot that day as work was really hectic so I arrived 10 mins late. I texted her when I arrived and asked her where should I meet them or which restaurant do I go into and waited. 30 minutes passed and still no response, I tried calling her and she never picked up. About 15 minutes later only she texted me the exact location of the place and told me to come to the restaurant.\n\nI was already pissed for waiting so long after what seemed to be a chaotic day at the office. Right after we sat down, I noticed “A” wasn’t here yet but I didn’t ask any questions. 10 minutes had passed and her phone vibrated, I could see that it’s “A” texting her that he’s here. She darted to go out of the restaurant to bring him in. I was very deeply hurt. In my head it was just this thought that “wow she is okay with letting me wait for almost an hour but she sprinted out to get “A”?”\n\nNot only that, throughout our relationship she has never once suggested activities or even showed the need/want to hangout. It was always me planning a trip, planning a date or even going out for food. Overtime I was getting more and more anxious and jealous and insecure of myself to the point where I would want to know where is she and who is she with.\n\nWe have this app called “life360” which tracks each other’s phones and we can know each other’s location in case of emergencies. We always get notifications when we leave our house and I always update her beforehand where I’m going and who’s going to be there so that she doesn’t feel worried or anxious. But she rarely updates me and barely texts me about who she’s seeing or where she’s going.\n\nI’ve talked about this with her before and she always dismisses it by saying “why’re you like this? You were never like this before?” Or empty promises to update me more often. I’m not sure what to do or what to feel anymore. Any advice on this would be greatly appreciated.\n\ntl;dr: (23m) is having trouble feeling loved by the (23f) girlfriend as she has been doing “odd” things in the relationship and now needs advice on what to do.",

For context there was situations in the beginning of the relationship where she told me she wanted me to get pregnant 5 months into our relationship so she could have a grandchild already. I told my boyfriend this made me uncomfortable and her told her to stop and the next time we were alone she told me “you don’t have to tell your boyfriends everything you know.” And after this I just kept my guard up. She would also talk down about him and say he was too needy and that his older brother (30m) was so smart and my bf was just eh. \n\n\n\nThings calmed down until I started inviting her to hangout with my aunts mom and I. She told my aunt c (55f) to find herself a married man and have an affair with him.. she then proceeded to tell the same aunt “it’s people like you that I don’t go to church anymore”. This took my aunts and mom aback because my aunt wasn’t saying anything bad about her religion. She was just converting to a new religion and that set my bf’s mom off. She then told my second aunt d (54f) that aunt c gained weight. Mind you they have only met 3 times. Aunt d was taken aback again and said that was peculiar to think. \n\nThen she complains to my mom that my bf calls my mom “mom” but I don’t call her “mom” and why is that? My mom then had to tell her that maybe she just doesn’t feel like it right now and is waiting if they ever get married. She was visibly upset about it because she brought it up again 2 other times. Then my bday happened and we ordered catering from BJ’s and she told my mom “your food is so good you’re a great cook” and it kind weirded my mom out because she kept telling my mom that even though my mom didn’t cook this day. She then mentioned it to me the next day again so weird. All of these comments are just adding up and up and I don’t know what to do because my bf is the sweetest guy there is and I don’t want to ruin anything.\n\nShe then came home with a dog for my bf and ever since then she’s been trying to tell me where to take the dog to get shots what medicine to give him and such and not telling my bf.. ngl I didn’t ever consent to wanting a dog too..  \n\nI do feel though that if we get married it’s going to get worse and that’s what’s scaring me of commitment, I don’t know what to do..\n\n**TL;DR;** my bf’s mom is making rude comments about my family calling my aunt fat basically, hinting my mom doesn’t know how to cook, telling me to get pregnant so she can have a grandkid already 5 months into our relationship, bought him a dog and is also telling me I’m responsible for him too. I feel like it’s scaring me away from him since we plan to get married and I don’t know if I should confront him? ",

      "content": "I'm a 40 (f) and my partner 38 (f).\n\nHere's the situation:\n\nMy partner and I together for over 5 years. When we met she told me about an online friendship we had with a man she was interested in. They met online and started talking. He's a \"public figure\" of sorts and asked her to meet up and go for a walk. She never met up with him, but I could tell by the way she told the story that she was very impressed with him and somewhat shocked he wanted to meet up.\n\nFast forward, I know she still has a friendship with this person. She mentions him once in a blue moon (a project he's working on or something like that.) One time, she mentions that he would like to meet me. I find this a bit strange, because I've never had a conversation with him or any connection. I know that while they've had this online relationship, they've never met in person.\n\nFast forward a few months ago, she flies to LA for a work event. I pick her up from the airport and notice she is DMing someone. I notice she's DMing for quite a while. I only read on the screen \"did you get home?\" And I see the name. This person is this man's ex partner. They still coparent and live together (strange I know). I get a very weird feeling in my gut. I'm thinking to myself, did she meet this person and his coparent? I can't get it off my mind, so the next day I ask \"did you see (persons name) when you were in LA?\" Immediately she answers \"yes.\" I ask her where and she says she went to their house and played with their kid. I ask her why she didn't tell me. I am at this point feeling very confused and upset. My ex has social anxiety and drove over 40 minutes to these people's house. It's unlike her.\n\nI start asking her questions, specifically why she wasn't honest about going there. She gets highly defensive. She starts yelling and telling me I'm crazy. Her reaction makes my stomach sink. I tell her something is going on here, and I have never had a feeling like this before. Specifically with this man. The next day, he DM's me and basically tells me that nothing at all happened, and that he doesn't appreciate me making an assumption. I found out my ex told him private parts of our conversation. I feel completely betrayed. And I'm made to look crazy.\n\nA few months ago, I'm going through financial records. I recognize a bunch of charges from 2023-present to this one company. I come to find out this is this man's company. He hosts webinars and you only need to pay a donation fee. I don't want to share the exact amount, but it comes to my attention that my ex has spent over $5,000 going to these webinars and I was not aware. She never told me this. Each charge is around $500 with a few for $1000. Now I'm really feeling betrayed. Especially because our shared funds were paying for his events, and he was outright accusatory towards me. She never once told me she was attending these events, let alone making such large donations. She had filed them with our bookkeeper as \"charity.\"\n\nThis makes me go through her phone records and I see that she is still having a few phone calls with him. Even after I'm upset about her going to his house. I was under the impression that after she violated my boundaries and shared personal information with him, that she didn't speak with him anymore. But she did, after he was rude towards me.\n\nAdvice is much needed and appreciated\n\nTLDR: Partner was caught going to a home of someone she was interested in the past. I know his coparent was there, but it still felt weird because she lied about it. She then told him I suspected something was going on and he (somewhat) told me off on DM. I also came to find out she spent $5,000 over a year and a half on his webinars that she never mentioned to me.",

      "content": "I [22F] and my [M25] boyfriend have been together officially for 7 years. We took a break last year, I broke up with him because I felt as though my needs weren't being met and I felt neglected and like I wasn't important to him. \n\nWe've been seeing each other regularly for the last year but he doesn't want to put a label on anything yet. He's currently in school and his family basically hates me for leaving him for someone else. \n\nFor some background information to better understand, his family is very emotionally unavailable and I came from a very emotional family and have learned its best to talk things out and express emotions and feelings instead of sweeping them under the rug. \n\nHis mother would make fun of me for not knowing basic things in front of their family members and make fun of personal problems I have with sensory things and he would never say anything in my defense after expressing that it hurt my feelings.They would bash my family and judge me if I ever came to them for guidance as I do not stay in contact with my own family anymore and don't have many friends thinking I could come to her as she'd call me the daughter she never had.\n\nOver the years I felt like I did most of the sacrificing in our relationship, driving every weekend to see him after he refused to leave his apartment with his roommates to spend the weekend at my apartment where I lived alone because he didn't have his PC with him or he didn't have his rig. \n\nWe spent a limited amount of time together alone without videogames or getting high, mainly when we'd run errands or be waiting for his friends to get home, from work, or watching tiktoks. When his friends got home I'd basically be sitting around bored for hours and sometimes crying because I felt left out and unwanted. His friend is very disrespectful to women and would subject him to grossly inappropriate content and games where he'd be playing as an unrealistic nude girl with unlimited customization options. \n\nWhen we would be intimate together, he'd always ask me to dress up and basically be something that I'm not, it got to the point where he'd be watching porn while we were doing things and there was a few times that I would cry or break down during it and it was just awful and extremely unhealthy for my already existing insecurities from being body shamed my whole life by my family, I weigh 230lbs and have a nice figure for my weight and height. \n\nI was very verbal through the entirety of our relationship with how he made me feel, making me be something I'm not, never complimenting me after basically asking in every way possible, never emotionally being there for me when I was going through personal and family problems. Sometimes I feel like we're incompatible but I love him very deeply and part of me feels that way because he was my first intimate partner but Im in love with him.\n\nOver they years I discovered his porn addiction and him micro cheating in private chat rooms. I've also found a post on hook up pages on Reddit which he swore he never followed through with physically but did meet up with a girl and smoked weed together and watched tv apparently. His social media algorithms are so personalized that even on Facebook he can't scroll for like two minutes without seeing boobs or something inappropriate. On tiktok is ads for sexy outfits, girls thrist trapping like every 10 to 15 videos. He's now asking about me wearing more specific things which im not entirely comfortable with.. I love him so I want to make him happy but I'm also afraid that I'm disrespecting myself and if I say no he'll find it somewhere else or resort back to chat rooms if he ever stopped that to begin with.. we're not even officially together but we're exclusive according to him, even though he won't tell anyone about us and we aren't living together.. \n\nI've talked to my friends about this many many times over the years and they all say the same thing, that it's not a good match, he isn't treating me the way a boyfriend should, that I deserve better. In my heart I think I  know that but I don't know what I'd do without him. He understands me so well but at the same time not in the ways I need him to understand me. We've talked about doing relationship counseling but even if we do, I'm scared his family will still hate me and be unkind to me and I'm worried that I'll still feel this way. \n\nTl;dr - what to do? Am I in the wrong, should I be more understanding and supportive? Am I allowing myself to be mistreated? Advice ",

We haven’t spent a single day apart in that time, and we’ve built a safe, loving life together. I want to visit my family and friends in India for 3 weeks, but he can’t come due to work and finances. While he understands why I need to go, he’s emotionally struggling with the idea of being alone at home. I feel really guilty and heavy about leaving him, even though we plan to stay connected. I’m looking for advice on how to better handle these emotions and this situation.\n\n------------\n\nHi! I'm a 23F and my bf is 24M. We have been together for over 3.5 years. We are living together for over a year a half now in AU. Before moving countries and living together, we were in an LDR for over two years, having met only once in that period. We live internationally while our families are based in India. We both are working, he works in office and I WFH - which kinda gives me a lot of flexibility.\n\nI haven't visited my family (parents and brother) and my friends back home in all this time. He hasn't either, and for even longer - about 3 years now. Me and him have not spent a single day apart in this period. It has brought us close in a different way that makes me bawl my eyes out of adoration for this man. We are content and we have built a lifestyle here, which makes me feel very safe.\n\nAlthough I have stayed connected to my family and friends regularly, I really wanted to go on a short three week break back home to meet everyone. My partner cannot make it with me because of his work and financial commitments - he really does want to but that would a callous decision considering his responsibilities. We are both upset about me leaving for a short time, but he is a bit more affected by this change because he would be alone at home, in a space that he's always shared with me. He said he understands why I need to go but there's this beautiful and vulnerable side to him which is asking me to stay back.\n\nFor some reason, I'm feeling guilt and this heaviness thinking about leaving. I reassured him that we will stay connected like we did when we were in LDR - but I still want to know how to handle this better.\n\nCan anyone give me a perspective? Or any advice that might help me better navigate through this situation?\n\n\n\n",

The last few weeks we had some pretty big arguments where he would say hurtful things like: “I don’t want you” and more like this. I’ve became insecure again and would check his social media (I would never check his chats just is he followed someone new or if he’d be looking up girls. Please don’t come after me, he broke my trust a few times and he gave me this willingly to reassure me and it did help so I haven’t checked in a long time until today). \n\nSo today we called and he really wanted to play a game with me for days but I had some problems installing this game so it took a few days before we got to it. Today was the day but unfortunately his wifi didn’t work and he got pissed and said he would go sleep. I asked him if we couldn’t spend a bit more time on call instead because we haven’t played the game at all due to his connectivity issues and we only called briefly. I already feel a bit insecure lately due to his statements and the arguments and whereas before he would love to call every day, lately through the fights we didn’t call as much anymore. So when I asked he blatantly told me no to which I replied that I understand he is upset he couldn’t play the game due to his wifi as he was looking forward for days to playing this game with me, why would he not want to spend time with me playing a different game because we haven’t called that much (and we had a big argument only two weeks ago lasting more than a week where we didn’t call so I missed him). He literally hung me up midsentence. He had done this before and I find this very disrespectful. I tried calling him many times as this got me upset because he could just wish me goodnight and not try to push his frustrations with his wifi unto me? It’s like he just wanted to play that game but not really spend time with me for that matter. He seemed almost annoyed with calling while earlier this day he called me very happy and was just his old self (yesterday we had another small argument..).  He literally scolded me, said some words, was very hard towards me.. while I only asked why he hung me up like that.\n\nHe went to sleep and I went on his Instagram. I saw he texted one of his girl friends that he wants to see her again at their friends house (she was an old coworker and it was never romantically or anything like it and I believe that he told me she was a lesbian). But also said: muchos love ❤️\nAnd this annoyed me because I know he would be upset if I would say the same to an old coworker friend. Anyhow it was more upsetting to me that he would treat me this evening like an annoyance but then ask an old coworker to hang out again..\n\nBut alas, the reason of my post is the following: I saw an earlier message thread between him and an old classmate. His last voicememo, dated 15 March 2024, literally said the following: “do you have a boo (-name of the girl-)or a shawty, or a dude that can call you a shawty, or are you to HC for it” something along these lines. He said it so flirty too. Am I going crazy? This was a month after the emotional cheating occurred and three months into the relationship…  I sent him many angry texts at this hour but he’s still asleep so I have no clue what the next steps are. Do I just block him? Is this platonic? Would a guy in a relationship send this to a female friend? She never even responded to it.\n\n ",

But today I had a really bad day and before the situation that caused the bad day happened, I messaged my boyfriend in the morning and asked him if he wanted to watch a movie I saw on TikTok. He said yeah we can. We normally call every night and sometimes we watch movies because we don’t live together. and I waited the whole day for him to be free so we can finally watch the movie. I’ve been wanting to watch for a couple days now. It was getting late. And he had work tomorrow. So I asked him how long is he going to be so that we can start watching. He then said that he’s going outside, this was around 11pm and he came home at 1 am. And this movie is about two hours long, so I was a bit mad because I knew he would’ve ended up falling asleep halfway into the movie. And I was waiting all day to watch this movie. I then told him that I’m mad because he came late. And that he would’ve fell asleep during the movie. I also told him that I waited the whole day for him. He just kind of brushed it and said okay we can watch something else at episode of something. And I told him that no I wanted to watch this movie specifically and I waited the whole day. He then said for me to just watch it on my own and he doesn’t understand that I’m upset. \n\n\nIs he disregarding my feelings? I feel like he doesn’t care about how he makes me feel. \nAnd I’m stuck between sticking through the disrespect because I love him and we have a lot history together or leaving because of the disrespect. I just feel like he doesn’t love me as much as he did because he would have never responded the way he did. Am I being over emotional? little stuff like this always happens but i feel like this is the last straw. \n\n\n\nTLDR- i just don’t think he respects me enough anymore or cares about my feelings. is it a phase bc i don’t have it in me to carry on like this.

      "content": "For years any time I've tried to have a constructive conversation about issues in our relationship my husband gets defensive. I've used gentle openings, \"I\" statements, adjusted my tone, and a bunch of other ideas from therapists, all without help. Every time he gets defensive, shuts down, and it turns into an argument. I've reached my limit on the relationship. He finally agreed to try therapy but he's only had one session. He says he doesn't know why he gets defensive but he's working on it. But him working on it seems more confusing. So for example if I bring up a concern, his immediate reaction is to turn it around and blame me or say really mean hurtful things to me about that concern. Its like he just verbally attacks me. But then two seconds later he say he used the wrong words or he didn't mean what he said. He claims he has difficulty finding the right words. But I wonder why mean hurtful things are the first thing he says and is that a reflection of what he is really thinking and then the backtracking is censoring himself? Thoughts?\n\nTL;DR husband says mean things during conversations but then says he didn't mean it",

I usually see her about once a month or a bit more often, at the beach, and we had a great friendly relationship — we were genuinely open and honest with each other.\n\nAbout 4 months ago, we had a light argument about some ideas. Nothing serious, no insults or anything, just some teasing remarks — the kind I often make with other friends, really nothing major.\n\nAfter that, we continued talking like usual for about 10 more days — sharing music links or memes on Instagram, and sometimes just asking how we were doing. Then, suddenly, she just ghosted me.\n\nI only realized it about a month later when she stopped replying to my messages (yeah, I know, I’m not exactly quick on the uptake). So I understood something was wrong, and I sent her an apology message — but she never replied.\n\nSome more time went by, and I noticed she had hidden her Instagram stories from me on both her accounts, without actually blocking me.\n\nI was really down about it, so I sent her a long message explaining how I was feeling — again, no response.\n\nThe last thing I did was comment under a concert post she made, asking if it was a specific stage — and she replied just with a “yes.” That’s it. Her stories are still hidden from me, and she’s not replying to any of my messages.\n\nI’ve always had great relationships with my friends, and I’ve always had plenty of them. I honestly don’t know how to act now.\n\nMy friends, who know every detail of the story, tell me I should just leave her alone — that she was rude and disrespectful.\n\nBut I’d like a second opinion from strangers, and also try to understand possible reasons for her behavior. I’ll see her again in August at the beach because we have mutual friends, and I don’t know whether I should talk\n\nTL;DR: A friend of mine has been ghosting me for months without a real reason. It's never happened to me before, and I just want to understand how I should handle it",

I’m scared because I don’t think I can\n\nI 26/F have been with my 27/boyfriend for over 7 years now. And we’ve been starting to talk about leveling up our relationship to the next level. He’s a good man and I do love him but I’m really scared about the future.\n\nFor context, he has a 20yo sibling who has severe autism. He has a brain of a 2-year old. Cannot communicate (but somewhat understands a few words based on his reactions), and does vocal stimming. Right now he’s under the care of both of his parents.\n\nMy bf told me that when the time comes that his parents can no longer take care of his brother, he plans to take him in with us. And that just scared me. I’m a light sleeper, so if he does vocal stimming at night (at worst, every night) idk if i’m ever going to get enough sleep. He seems kinda violent sometimes (at one point, he pulled my hair really hard at their family gathering for no reason). And I also want to have a dog in the future but I’m not sure if he’s going to be okay with it? (Right now they have dogs but they don’t let them inside the house). And what about if we have kids… how are they going to react. To add, he also poops everywhere and literally needs to be monitored 24/7 because he does a lot of things like drinking water from the toilet, or eating things he shouldn’t. As a person who loves to travel, I feel like when he starts living with us, we won’t be able to travel as a complete family as he would have to stay with him.\n\n\nThere’s all sorts of questions in my head and anxious thoughts that weigh so much. I don’t want to breakup and sometimes I blame myself for not thinking through this from the very beginning. But I don’t regret every single moment with my bf. I love him so much and I was ready to be his bride… not until this thought came into the picture.\n\n\n",

      "title": "My (21F) boyfriend's (23M) grandmother recently passed away and I don't know how best to support him",
      "content": "Hi all, my boyfriend (23M) and I (21F) have been together almost 5 years now. We met in university and have been graduated for about a year or so, at which points we both moved back to our hometowns. He lives with his parents, little brother (9M), and grandmother which is quite normal here for young adults (I also live with my parents). Due to the job market where we live, it's been difficult for him to find a job but he's been filling his time split between helping out with his dad's shop and taking care of his little brother.\n\nVery recently, his grandmother suddenly passed while his parents were away on a rare vacation. Because his dad was away, he was fully in charge of the store for the first time and had been there early morning until evening the past week - which is where he was when he recieved the call about his grandmother. Thankfully, someone was at the house who was able to help bring his grandmother to the nearest hospital but unfortunately, she had already passed when he got back. It was honestly a very heartbreaking and stressful day, and I had came when I heard the news from him. I grew up quite sheltered and perhaps, as a consequence, came out a bit ignorant when it came to real-world things such as this, as I've never so closely witnessed a relative's passing until now. Therefore, I had already advised him to contact our other close friends who I knew had experiences (unfortunately) with loved ones' passings, to maybe better help him work through the following legalwork, procedures, etc. while also lending a shoulder to cry on. I stayed the entire day with them all because I just wanted to support him in whatever way I could, even if I maybe didn't know how. To add, this was honestly a life-changing experience for him because not only did he experience a family member's passing, I think it was the first time he truly felt and was forced to be a 'functioning adult' in the family. For all intensive purposes, he was the sole head of his family during this ordeal. \n\nHe's been up and down emotionally and I'm trying my best to just be there for him, but sometimes I feel that he doesn't want to be seen as vulnerable in front of me. To add on, when he does get suddenly emotional, I also just never seem to be there which frustrates me so bad because it breaks my heart knowing how broken he must feel and all I really want to do is support him but I just don't know *how*. I do try to reassure him and I told him as well how proud I was seeing him take charge of the situation so effectively, checking on him personally, especially now that his family's here (long history), but he gives me nonchalant answers like \"I'm alright\" or \"Yeah, thanks for being here\". I don't want to force him to share with me, so I don't try to pry further but it's the same answer in the same neutral tone every time even when I know he's just cried some time before (his friends would tell me). I also know grief is incredibly complex and therefore, might not be a continous wave of emotions, so that also deters me from prodding further because maybe he does feel alright in the moments I ask and my asking would just be triggering something unnecesary.\n\nHis friend group, who he's had since high-school, has been a tremendous help and have been there consistently for him as well which I'm grateful for since I think they help him take his mind off things. They're quite rambunctious, but in a funny way and the dynamic between them all is a lot of jokes (which is great since it helps put a smile on his face despite everything he's faced and is facing). So, I'm really glad honestly to see him with them because at least he regains emotions even if I'm not the one making him laugh. \n\nBut, to be frank, I've really just felt helpless throughout this entire thing and I think it's starting to show. He's really good at reading me, especially when something's not right, so he's already starting to catch on that something's wrong with me. He's been asking me if everything's alright and that he's sorry for being so busy with everything, or that he's sorry if he's done something and I, of course, always tell him that there's nothing to be sorry for and to stop worrying about me, because the real problem is me. I don't feel like I've contributed anything at all where everyone else has helped in the funeral logistics, procedural advice, or just helping him take his mind off things for a moment, and it just makes me feel useless because it breaks my heart knowing the hurt and stress he's feeling and I feel helpless in supporting him. I love him so much and we have plans for a future together, but how will that look if I can't even help him now?\n\nI know this is a selfish perspective because none of this is about me but I just can't shake this overwhelming guilt. I don't want to burden him more with any of this but if I can't control it, he will for-sure confirm that something's up and it might inadvertently add to his pressures as well. Originally, I planned to just keep it all to myself but now I'm wondering if it's better to say something sooner rather than later so we can work through this quickly and get back to the real focus of the situation. At the same time, I also hate this idea because morally, I think it's wrong and again, *it's not about me*, so I should just bottle it all up and mask myself better. I don't know, maybe I'm still a little naive and young in terms of serious relationships because I can't think of any other solutions. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what to do here and moving forward because even after crying out my frustrations alone, I still feel the guilt and helplessness and it's impeding on my being there for him, which is what I really want to do. \n\nSorry that it came out so long and massive apologies if a lot of it sounded like one, big whine. I just thought it relevant to show why and how I've been feeling helpless alongside some other contexts. I'm also not a big poster so sorry if some things are not right!\n\nTL;DR My long-time boyfriend's grandmother passed away very recently and I've felt useless in being there for him as I'm not sure how to. Meanwhile, his friends and family have been a tremendous help and it makes me feel even more guilt. He's starting to catch on that something's wrong with me and now, I'm not sure if I should voice something to avoid further burden on him so that we can quickly go back to what's truly important or if this is a me problem and I should just fake it better until I resolve it myself. Is this all just a self-centred train of thought? And how can I just get back to supporting him without any worry because that's all that I really want to do. ",

I don’t really post, but I need to vent and maybe get some advice because I feel completely lost right now.\n\nI (23F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for almost two years. We’ve talked about moving in together soon, and while I’m excited, I’m also nervous. I have anxiety, and it really affects how I process emotions and interact with the world. I overthink *everything*. I also tend to cry a lot when I’m overwhelmed, which makes it hard to communicate clearly and it makes me feel ashamed.\n\nOver the long weekend, I went to visit my boyfriend. He lives one town over. He was playing video games, and I didn’t want to just stare at my iPad after working 40 hours that week, so I went to the living room to watch a new reality show instead. About 30 minutes later, he came out and (in what felt like an aggressive tone) said:  \n“Can you stop having an attitude?”\n\nThat completely threw me off. I didn’t even realize anything was wrong. When I tried to ask what he meant, I got overwhelmed and started crying as I genuinely didn’t know what I had done. He apologized, but I still felt hurt and confused.\n\nThen, as all this was going on, his parents walked in (they had just come in from out of town), and I had to immediately act like nothing was wrong. Internally, I was falling apart. I ended up crying nonstop sunday and monday.\n\nI eventually left early and went back to my apartment. When I got home, I called him and tried to explain what I was feeling. I said something like: “Hey, I’ve been sitting with a lot from this weekend. I know you’re stressed with work stuff, and I really do get that. I just ended up feeling really shut out, and when things got tense, I didn’t feel emotionally okay staying. I also know I shut down around your parents  I just felt exhausted and didn’t know how to talk about it.\"\n\nHis immediate response was: “I think you need to go back to therapy.”\n\nThat hurt. I know he’s stressed, but I felt dismissed. It made me question everything. Since then, we’ve been distant. I love him a lot, but now I’m wondering… is it over? Did I mess this all up?\n\nTLDR: I (23F) visited my boyfriend (26M) over the weekend. He got upset and told me to “stop having an attitude” when I was just watching TV alone. I got overwhelmed, started crying, and felt really dismissed. His parents walked in mid-breakdown, and I had to pretend I was fine. I left early and tried to calmly explain my feelings later, but he just told me I “need to go back to therapy.” Now we’re distant, and I feel confused, ashamed, and wondering if this relationship is right or if I messed it all up.

We live together, have animals together, and have discussed buying a house. She pushes more and more for a ring. The issue is, every time these \"forever\" events get discussed, my mind goes to all the things she does that drive me insane or make me insecure about the relationship.\n\nFor instance, I am very extroverted. I need to be social and hang out with friends or I get very withdrawn and short with people. However, she does not want to go out and do those things regularly. She needs a week to get enough social energy for a few hours out. The issue comes when I make commitments to things that do not involve her that take me out of the house (social organizations, etc.) then all I hear is how much she misses me and wishes I was home. I cannot be home as much as she wants me to be and support my mental health but if I am not home, I hear about how she and the dogs miss me and she will be glad when I am done with this activity so I am home again.\n\nI NEED this social stimulation and I understand that she NEEDS to not feel pressured to be social. She has suggested on occasion joining me at some of my events but she wants to get there at the start time and leave either before or as soon as things wrap up because her battery is spent. That cuts into the social aspect for me because its the socialization before and after that really make the events enjoyable.\n\nI cannot imagine starting over again without her, but I also cannot picture a future where I am stuck at home for fear of being nagged about going out again.\n\n\\---\n\n\n\n\\*\\*TL;DR;\\*\\* : My GF is an introvert and I am an extrovert.

      "content": "I'm in a great relationship except I think my BF is looking for validation from other women. Should I try to work through it with him?\n\nI've been in a great relationship for 3 months--really really good. But I've caught my BF chatting with other women. The first time, with a high school friend who he swears is just an old friend and needed relationship advice. He showed me a couple of innocuous texts. Then I noticed he had sent her a picture of himself. Which upset me, so I asked to read the rest of the messages. He said no and got super defensive and immediately deleted the app and messages. He said he had shared things about his mental health that he didn't want me to read, and that's all. He knows I have severe trust issues because my last BF was a serial cheater, so after lots of back and forth, he said he'd ask her to send him screenshots of their conversation. Which was more than 2 weeks ago.\n\nHe's been guarding his phone ever since, which makes me even more suspicious. I asked to look at it, since he told me early on that I could, but now he has changed his mind. He says it is a boundary issue and not that he has anything to hide. However, yesterday, after I asked him again about the screenshots and he said he was still working on it (again), he relented and let me look at some of his pictures. When I opened his photos I saw screenshots of of texts he had with his ex-gf--he immediately grabbed the phone and deleted them even though they were fairly innocuous. But what freaked me out was when I opened his Reddit app and saw that he had begun chatting with a woman. Nothing romantic had been exchanged. He said he was lonely and looking for friends. I asked to read more and he immediately deleted his account.\n\nHe continues to swear that there isn't anything to see or hide, and he even tried to recover the Reddit account. So maybe he just needs to feel some validation? I really don't think he has done anything in person, but I know he isn't being completely honest with me either. He swears I am the only woman and regrets responding to the woman's introduction on Reddit. He acknowledges that he caused this and wants to fix it, if I'll give him another chance.\n\nTL;DR? I'm in a great relationship except I think my BF is looking for validation from other women. Should I try to work through it with him?",

However, I have serious reservations which is putting me off the idea. \n\nHer Dad is obbessed with conspiracy theories, Anti Medicine, screams, shouts and swears when confronted. He never calls her unless she calls him; he never visits her, only her visiting him even though he lives doors away. He has threatened every member of family. He does not take responsibility for anything that has happened in his life and goes crazy if challenged on any of his views. Blaming his aggression as out of his control, followed by a sob story and crying.\n\nHer Mum treats her like a child, she is very immature and loves family drama and gossip. \n\nHer mum and dad are not together but still obsessively stay in touch. They point score and can often be insufferable, the roles are reversed. Dad living with sister due to dad not being able manage his finances as wastes all money on Cigerettes and Cannabis. Mum is every emotional and demands children's attention. \n\nMy GF is submissive to them both, can never challenge their views, so let's dad fall deeper in to his views and his behaviour is widely accepted within the family. Same cycle of dad being abusive, apologies, crys they all hug him.\n\nI cannot bring a child in to this environment.

I knew it was just a joke, but it made me incomfortable anyways. \n\nI decided to bring this up to my girlfriend by saying the jokes they were saying hurt and made me uncomfortable. She went on to say that she thought it was obvious that it was just a joke, and she didn't understand why it was such a big deal.

      "content": "I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,”(28F), a close friend since we were 11 with her BF (28M), and “T,”(28F), who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home, but now live in different places.\n\nT lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely in marketing. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.\n\nThere were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.\n\nT also kept asking for things, asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit, so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.\n\nThe night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning to a Western country after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too, but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”\n\nAfter she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more (and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much, and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S, who’s always been more well-off and polished, was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume to try, and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?\n\nThere was another moment that stuck out — when I said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because I’m not in touch with them anymore (edit). Both of them gave pretty strong reactions to that — it felt judgmental.\n\nTo be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.\n\n# I don’t know how to process this. I feel distant from both friends now, and I’m not sure if I should try to repair things or give them space and move on. How do I approach this — should I reach out and talk to them, or let the distance settle? How do you know when it’s time to let go of friendships that feel different now?\n\n# TL;DR:\n\nTwo old friends (28F) visited me (28F). One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host, had a breakdown after they left, and now I’m wondering how to fix things — or if I should just move on. How do I handle this?",

We grew up together and had a relationship for three years before I broke up with him because he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me, not that he ever treated me bad but he was just immature I think and also wasn’t very honest about how he felt or about things in general. Flash forward 5 years later and we have now been talking for 8 months. To my surprise I actually really like him and think he’s incredibly funny. He treats me so well that the first time I ever saw him he gifted me a really expensive thing telling me how he remembered I wanted it. He does really nice things for me, I have never needed to lift a finger around him, he plans trips, he tells me how much I mean to him, takes me shopping, never complains, etc. I also have yet to catch him in a lie but I have trauma from catching him in the past in lies so I don’t even look at his phone or anything anymore nor do I want to. Anyways even with this new leaf he’s turned I don’t know how I feel. \nHe wants to ask me to be his girlfriend and some days or even weeks I’ll feel so good about that but then other times I get anxious thinking about it. When I see him sometimes I feel intense anxiety but I’m not sure if it’s about him or relationships or life. For background I struggle with commiting to anyone and I think this is from a lack of a loving home in my childhood. I experienced a bit of trauma growing up so I don’t love like a normal person would. I don’t really like affection. Not that I can’t show it but I just struggle with it. I’m also not sure if I’m attracted to him physically tho I am definitely attracted to him somewhat, I am more attracted to his personality. \n\nI also hate the dating field as I’ve been with multiple other people both long term and short but have never actually dated anyone other than him. \nWe also have different career paths and could end up in completely different states tho I know this isn’t the worst thing it still worries me.\nHe is so great and I love him a ton but I don’t know why my brain is struggling. He’d drop anything for me and I wanna do the same but I’m panicking. He’s my best friend and it’s been like that for years. I just don’t know what to do.\n\nTL;DR;: great guy with a complicated past, anxiety about the situation, should I stay and work it out or go",

      "content": "I had a friend group last year. This year I wasn't in their class. I had trouble including myself in convos at lunch but tried making efforts. Once I asked to come to a party and they invented an excuse so i didnt come because they didn't want the friend I was bringing. I let that pass and then they were planning a hang out to the skating rink. I couldnt come but nobody asked me. I told them why I couldnt but they didn't care and I didn't think much of it it wasn't a big deal.\nBut then some days later I learned that one girl was saying that if I came she wouldnt come. I confronted her, and asked my closest friends about it. She told me she was here if I wanted to talk, but didn't it was late at night so she stopped responding. But she never responded to my messages after that. It hurted me but I didn't say anything. \n\nFast forward last month I learned that I wasn't invited to a big hang out because I distanced myself too much and the mean girl said that if I was coming she wouldn't come again even though i thought she would stop after talking to her about it. I talked to my closest friend, she told me to get over it (wasn't mean saying it) but I tried to communicate to understand but she would disregard a lot a my messages. About the thing the girl said she said that she couldnt ask me to hang out because some people didnt want me there, but admitted that i was progressively excluded from hang outs. Also, i asked why she wasnt telling me what was happening, she told me that i already knew everything and that i knew more than her about the story. Didn't have the chance to talk more about the subject as she wanted to stop talking about it. I thought that maybe I didn't communicate enough beforehand but I just found out texts from just a few days after learning all about the first exclusion where I complained about being excluded and that nobody was doing anything about it. My closest friend saw it but never responded. It really makes me want to just stop talking to her as we already don't talk much. But she is also the only one in the group to do efforts for my bd and stated multiple times that she didn't us to drift apart.\n \nMoreover, she complained multiples times last year that she didn't feel included in the group and I always reassured her and at least asked if she was coming to some hang outs\n \nI feel like im becoming crazy as the only mean girl in the group was the one I talked about in the beginning. My friend was a nice person so I can't help but thinking I might do a mistake cutting her of but I can't help but ressent her now\n(Sorry for my bad English)\nTL;DR : mean girl excludes me and my closest friend in the group does nothing about it.",

      "content": "I am (38M) who has dated my gf (42F) for 5 years now (met in 2020). Since we dated, I had to plan everything from dates to trips. I'm just realizing this now that I had to make all the effort. This year, I wanted to do something special for our anniversary and take us to Peru in which I'll be paying for everything. I asked her since I am working overtime and working on settling in a house I just bought, if she can help with looking at accommodations. I sent her an interirary I made with everything we are doing the 2 weeks we are there and if she can just pick hotels she likes. Well, it has been 2 months and I ask almost daily if she even looked at the itinerary because we leave soon and hotels are being booked. I told her I need her help and asked what she was doing the past 2 months and it's the same story: I am spending time with my friends or spending time with her dad and too busy. I could have easily chosen the hotels but I want to know that she cares. And in the past, the places I have chosen she always comments on that she could have chosen better (then why not choose them!). I can't believe I have to beg someone to go to a paid vacation. Peru is somewhere I've wanted to go to since 1995. I'm thinking of cancelling the trip altogether and going by myself. Am I wasting my time with her? I feel we are too old for this bullsh*t.\n\nTo add more insight, I had schedule this trip at a specific time frame that worked best for her and her friends. This time frame pretty inconvenient for me since I go back to work the following day I come back from the trip. I've had to plan dates around her friends schedule since I met her. Everything has been snow balling emotionally the past year in the number of times she has bailed on me for other people. I am at a point where I am constantly thinking about ending things but worried this is trivial or non-issue thing to complain about. I can't see myself dealing with this anymore.\n\ntl;dr: Is it worth continuing a relationship if you aren't the priority? I personally couldn't marry someone doing this to me. Or do I try other forms of communication to salvage it?",

      "content": "My partner and I met and started dating 6 years ago. When we first met they didnt identify as non-binary, and we started our relationship as a lesbian relationship. I am a lesbian and I am not attracted to men. I have tried, many times, it just does not happen for me and I cannot force it. That being said they were the love of my life. We fell very very in love and I have never experienced the acceptance they showed me. The love they showed me was magic and I look back with very strong fondness at that time of my life.\n\nThey started to transition in earnest 3 years ago. They were very hesitant to do so initially. They knew I'm a lesbian and was not attracted to men. And they didnt want to transition for that reason. I encouraged them to do it wholeheartedly, because being trans is something you do for yourself, not for anyone else. I assured them that I wasn't considering leaving them over that,  and that it was men i wasnt attracted to not non-binary people. I told them that they had to do it for themselves. That it was crucial, even. And they did, they've been on T for quite a while and are much more masculine and in general pass as a man. They're non-binary, but yeah even so we get read as a straight couple and theyre often referred to as my boyfriend (a term they like). Over time though... its just not the same anymore. I struggle with intimacy with them, I am still deeply attracted to who they are. But their body has changed and their demeanor has changed and it's just no longer within what I'm attracted to. Its starting to hurt me to force myself through it. I want them to be happy but I am unsatisfied in several ways and have had a lot of feelings that I'm not voicing because I do not want to hurt them in any way.\n\nThey are also disabled and reliant on me for a lot of things. I rely on them for a lot too, as I am not always in the best mental state. Neither of us has a relationship with our families. We both experienced a lot of abuse growing up so we're mostly by ourselves. I can work and am working but they aren't as they have been going to therapy. They wouldn't have anywhere to go if our relationship ended. They don't have support to fall back on. And their mental health fluctuates and at somewhat routine times they are suicidal. I'm so scared of what would happen if I did decide to leave.\n\nI don't really know what I'm looking for. Someone who has been in this situation I guess? I feel so much guilt and fear. I'm semi-sick today because of how anxious this whole thing is making me. I'm so scared of being alone too. They do provide emotional support to me, which has been very helpful for me at times. I just don't know what to do. I feel like no matter how I look at the situation I'm in the wrong. That I'd be throwing away the life weve built together and that its my fault.\n\nTL;DR my partner transitioned and I'm losing attraction to them but they are disabled and we are very dependent and I have no idea what to do.",

      "content": "Hi friends )\n\nI apologize for my rough English, it is not my first language.\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I are both international students from Slovakia. We get along pretty great and have lots in common, but one main difference is that I feel at home here, while she still feels like her home is back there. I believe that over the years I have grown accustomed to this culture, its language, its food, and its sports (go Cubs!) but not she.\n\nThat would be fine but there's more. Due to her feeling that way, she travels home constantly. She spends one, two, or even three months with her family back home. While I do miss my parents, my brother and I understand they made a huge effort sending us to study abroad, so we don't really feel the need to go back. We owe it to them to make a life here. Parents feel the same way.\n\nI told her before that I can't handle long distance, she said she understood. But now it's been almost a year of us being together but she going home for months, sometimes I feel like we are not together anymore. Makes it seem she didn't care about respecting my limits. Makes me confused. But on the other hand, I don't want to say to her to not go home, that would be rude and controlling, she is a great girl and I wouldn't want to make her sad.\n\nI just fear things will not be the same when she gets back. That we will have grown apart too much, due to pretty much being out of each other's lives for 1/4 of a year. She thinks we should try a different approach this time, so we don't grow apart, like videochatting more often, but I don't think that will change much. She's either here or she's not. And when she's not, I feel like the only one that is sad.\n\nTLDR: Girlfriend often goes home for months. I have told her I can’t do long distance but she still leaves. I feel like we’re drifting apart. I am frustrated that this seems so much easier for her, makes me think she is not as interested in our relationship as I.",

      "content": "Throwaway bc I don’t want family to find this. \n\nThere’s a lot of necessary backstory so bear with me. TLDR at the bottom. \n\nI (34F) and my husband (35m) have two daughters (1.5, 3mo). We are currently living in my childhood home with my dad (78m) and my sister (32F). We decided to move in when we were expecting my first daughter which was soon after my mom passed away. It is a huge help for us financially to be here as I am a SAHM now and our previous apartment would have been very tough to afford on one income and it also was not going to be a good environment for babies. We do not formally pay rent but we cover almost all food costs for everyone, I cook meals, and my husband and I have taken over some of the tasks around the house that are getting too difficult for my dad to do. Everyone in the house is happy with this arrangement. A big factor in us moving in was also the fact that my mom had passed and we wanted more family to be around my dad. He has no friends (by choice) and even with my sister around (she works a lot and is not often home) we all didn’t feel comfortable with how much alone time he would have. My mom was his life and we didn’t know what he would do with his time moving forward and he also needs more looking after due to his old age. When I brought up the idea of my family moving in to my dad, he said he had been planning on extending the invitation for us to come live there so it was a mutual decision. \n\nA couple months after my mom passed away, my older half brother (53 M - same dad) with whom I had a previously positive but distant relationship with, started making comments to my sister about how my husband and I were freeloaders by moving into the house and taking up so much space. My brother has never lived in this house and I was obviously hurt when my sister told me about these comments because I felt it wasn’t true about our situation but also it isn’t his business. At this point we hadn’t moved in yet but the plans were pretty much set. My brother never said anything to me about it but my sister showed me texts he sent her that were really negative and strongly worded. I mentioned this to my dad and his response was that it wasn’t my brother’s business and that he wanted my family to come move in. I tried to let the comments go and we moved on. \n\nFast forward a year and a half later to now. Over the last year and a half, my brother has made some other comments to me disguised as jokes that I haven’t appreciated. It’s obvious to me that he looks down on me and doesn’t like me very much, which I hadn’t ever felt before the whole housing situation. Pretty suddenly a few months ago, he reached out saying that he felt tension and didn’t know why and wanted to talk about it in person, just the two of us. I met up with him and that conversation was basically a two hour monologue of him saying how unwanted he felt by the family because of things my mom did and said before I was born. Of course I don’t know what actually happened but when I told my dad this, he said none of those things were true. Keep in mind all of this is very upsetting to hear considering my mom has recently passed away and my brother’s mom is still alive. In the same conversation he said that he wanted us to be closer and basically insinuated that the reason we haven’t been closer in the past was my mom keeping us apart (not true based on what I saw growing up). \n\nWe recently met again to have another conversation at his request and I basically said I didn’t know what would be possible for us in terms of a closer relationship because of what he said about me and my husband concerning us moving in. He very quickly said he was just making sure my dad was happy with the arrangement and that he said nothing negative and blamed my sister for spinning it into a negative story. He said he felt used by my sister and it was clearly her fault for putting thoughts in my head. After the conversation I talked to my sister who showed me the texts again and it’s clear my brother is lying. He had been saying again and again how honesty was important and we were all going to have to be truthful to have a good relationship moving forward so the lies hurt even more because of that. I had been wondering why he wasn’t reaching out to my sister about having a closer relationship and without me asking, he said it’s because I have kids and he wants to be a present uncle. I get that but it also made me feel like the means to an end. \n\nI have decided to explicitly say I can’t have a close relationship with him for the above reasons, as well as various smaller boundaries that have been crossed. I have a text drafted and I’m going to include screenshots of his texts as proof that he lied to me. Based on what he has expressed, I need to be explicit about this and can’t just distance myself because he said he will keep pushing to be involved. \n\nNow the issue is when I should do it. His son (who I don’t have a relationship with and he blames me and my late mom for that) is graduating from college and we’ve all been invited to the ceremony and a party in a month. Up until now I had been planning on going because I knew it was important to my brother. I think my nephew could probably care less if I were there or not. The main reason I don’t know about just not going is that my dad’s ex (brothers mom) will be there and my dad has absolutely no desire to see her or interact with her. Based on what I know about her I don’t blame him. It’s important that he goes to this event snd I don’t want to leave him high and dry with her there and I don’t know if just my sister will be enough of a buffer. My dad wants to stay out of this drama between my brother and I and won’t really comment on it and I know if I ask him what he thinks I should do about going to graduation, he will not give a real answer and just will want to avoid having to deal with it. \n\nTLDR; I have decided to tell a family member we can’t have a close relationship but he is hosting an important family function. Do I tell him and not go or wait until after the function to say something? I don’t want to be two-faced but also don’t want to cause more family drama and tension. \n\n",

We argue a lot but we resolve it afterwards. But lately, it's been really hard since it's about boys. He's been pretty clear that I shouldn't be too close because he said that I dont have any spacial awareness and I can be too physically close to them. Me and him are classmates so he sees what I'm doing with the others.\n\nHere is an example scenario: We're having a group activity and I'm the leader so I gotta talk to everyone fast because we only have 5 minutes. My bf was upset and said when I talk to my groupmates that are boys I'm so close to them like I have no personal space at all. I explained that I am that way since the beginning and I was just talking to them in a rush but that's not working. \n\nMy bf said when I have a problem he'll change immediately without a doubt. That made me feel guilty so I said I'll change but he said it can't happen again otherwise it's gameover. We had a big argument about this and he said hurtful words. \n\nFor me, it's really hard because I really couldn't control how I act or talk especially when I'm in a rush. I really love him and want to work things out with him but I feel scared because what if I accidentally forgot. I requested for him to have more patience but he said changing is pointless if I forget. \n\n\nSo, should I do what he said or is he making things complicated?\n\nTL;DR\nI don't have spacial awareness and my boyfriend has a huge problem with that.

      "content": "TL,DR: I don't think my boyfriend is showing me enough attention and isn't picking up any hints, and I always have to tell him everything in order for him to actually do something for me. How do I bring it up without whining/complaining too much, since we had a pretty similar conversation about the same topic not too long ago?\n\n\n\n\nI have a loving boyfriend. We've been friends for a few years before getting together, and he was so much better than my other friends at the time because we could bond over shared bad/traumatic experiences, but also general taste, opinions, thoughts and so on. \nWe got together 7 months ago, and while we had a few problems here and there, we worked through them as we promised to communicate calmly. However, I may he holding a grudge still and I'm here for opinions and advice.\n\nFor our 6 month anniversary (which I find quite special cus you know,, half a year and all), I made him a nice present and bought him a book - nothing fancy but still personal and I did put in effort. He bought me nothing. He didn't get me anything for our 5 month anniversary either, but I was fine with both as I enjoyed his company and I don't really need material things or gifts from him to feel loved, and besides, he already got me nice gifts for our first month together. But then again, is it that difficult to get/make a small thing? Or make/buy a small, spontaneous gift without me always having to ask? He's awkward and somewhat insecure, afraid of making mistakes or \"driving me away\" (despite me repeatedly telling him that I genuinely couldn't care less about what gift he gets me/makes me as long it's not something I openly hate. I love him to death). I told him how I felt hurt about some stuff and needed him to pick up hints and notice behaviours or patterns that I do when I'm, for example, upset (which are very obvious and we've discussed them thoroughly a few times, even before we got together). He apologised and said he'd try and notice more and be there for me in the future, so we soothed that out - or so I thought, I guess.\n\nI've had a urinary infection not too long ago and I've only recently recovered from it, but I got sick a few days ago (a somewhat serious cold but nothing dangerous) which is making me exhausted and irritable. I've been having check-ups and talks with the doctors at least twice a week these past few weeks because of both the urinary infection and now the cold, and not once has he offered on his own to even keep me company. Which I find hurtful.\n\nI understand that he's busy with his school and that maybe he's not in the mood to get out of the house or something, but it still hurts that he doesn't even offer help or to visit me. A few times he just outright forgot or ignored that I'm sick, until I reminded him. He hasn't gotten me anything to eat/drink when I invited him to come over (and only because it was also convenient for him, and he used to get me stuff, especially sweets and food like that before). \nBut whatever, that's fine. But he also seems.. uncaring, or disinterested. Is it really that hard to just reply to my message telling him I'm going to the hospital because I feel like shit and my health isn't improving with more than \"owww, rest up\"? Is saying something like \"I'm busy/tired/whatever today but if I could, I'd keep you company\" really that difficult, even if it's a lie? \nIt's literally the same aforementioned talk about attention and spontaneous acts of kindness (whether physical, verbal, in terms of gifts) that we had. And I'm tired of always asking things of people, especially of him. When he's sick, I make sure to buy him his favourite snacks, to cuddle with him, to offer to take care of him and try to do it should the circumstances allow. But he just doesn't return the favour despite me telling him, more than once, that I'd appreciate such things, even if just an attempt or offer. I don't get why, and if I'm just an asshole or seeking attention. I don't know how to tell him all of this without sounding like I'm whining/complaining too much. How do I tell him, what do I do? How do I communicate properly with him and let him know?\nAny help/advice is appreciated, sorry for the long ass post.\n",

      "content": "i (19F) and my boyfriend (18M) have been together for almost two years now. ever since we started dating his parents and his older sister has made it painfully clear that they do not like me. \n\nbackground: me and my current boyfriend started dating his junior year and my senior year of high school. previous to that we were good friends. i had been dating one of his friends my sophomore year until beginning of senior year until i broke it off because the things we wanted in life were completely different and i didn’t see it working out in the future. i began dating my current boyfriend (ill call him will) in april of my senior year. even before we started dating, his parents and my ex’s parents were good friends and when they realized i was with will, they began to dislike me. at first, it was just his mom. she would tell him things saying that i was not a good person for dating his friend and then him (which i know could come off as wrong but there was no unfaithfulness while dating my ex), and saying that she doesn’t want him dating me. he stood up to her in the beginning until she started taking some drastic measures and at one point even came to me and begged me to stop being with her son. we broke up a couple times due to him not wanting to upset his parents but always got back together because we still loved each other. there was one time where they found out we were sexually active and his parents threatened to tell my parents everything that i had done and what has been going on. there was also another time where i had went to his house to just pick him up to grab some food, and his sister came up to me and basically told me i was immature and she had “gone through something similar and knew that we wouldn’t work out” as well as yelling and crying telling me to leave will. i left and let him deal with his sister but during that time it mentally impacted me heavily so i just decided to distance myself to not see his family at all. \n\nnow to real time: \n**TL;DR** his sister currently also has a boyfriend who is the same race as me so i know it’s not a race thing, and they treat him so well. they invite him to dinners, take him on family trips, and whatnot. i’m currently a upcoming sophomore in college and he is about to graduate. we did long distance for a year and made it through. my boyfriend and i’s relationship is great, we have no problems and plan on staying together and potentially moving in together in college (if his parents allow). it just bothers me because even though he’s about to leave for college, his parents still try to control how much time he spends with me or even how late he stays out (sometimes telling him to come home at like 10pm when he has nothing else to do the next day). his mom in my eyes has been manipulating him as she’ll make subtle “jokes” to try to get him to go home and at one point before we started dating, would cry to him about being depressed because he was going against what she told him to do. i’ve been dealing with it up until now, but in my eyes, he’s about to head off to college and his mom is still trying to control how much time he spends with me. i’m also planning on transferring to the same college he is going to (not solely for him but for my major) and it’s just frustrating. he doesn’t want to always do what his mom says but he will sometimes cave when it comes to his mom controlling when he’s out with me. i don’t want his family to continue disliking me but i also don’t know how to especially get his mom to change her opinion about me, so im not sure what to do at this point. are there any tips i can do?",

      "title": "My (19M) boyfriend has been giving me (19F) extreme mixed signals.",
      "content": "I (19F) have been with my boyfriend (19M) for 2 years. Throughout our relationship, my boyfriend has always been relatively good with consistent love. We would have deep talks at night, wish each other a good morning, see each other at school, and make sacrifices to see each other, even just for a minute. It's also important to note that my boyfriend has been diagnosed with ASPD, so I've always been mindful that expressing certain feelings may be hard (we have had several long talks about it), and it's never seemed to be an issue in our relationship.\n\nHowever, over the past couple of months, my boyfriend has suddenly been giving me extreme mixed signals. It's a long story - but our school, alongside other schools (we are a small town, so we conjoined with others) went to Greece. His distance started there, where he seemingly avoided me, wouldn't smile or express any emotions with me, and wouldn't even make eye contact. I tried my best to give him space while remaining loving, but even after the trip, the distance didn't subside. I eventually confronted him over it, and he ended up sobbing and apologizing. He promised to change. However, since then, he has still been very off. Whenever we are in public (at school, at functions, really anywhere with other people) he seems emotionless when I'm around. He talks quietly, avoids PDA (we also talked about this, in which he told me he definitely enjoys PDA), and often doesn't smile or make eye contact. I often feel like a lost puppy and an after-thought, as he smiles and laughs freely with his other friends. However, in private (calling at night or hanging out), he behaves as I have always known him. He even talks about how much he cares about me, and how excited he is for 'our future' (although sometimes he is distant when the future comes up). Ive also noticed other behaviors which I find confusing, like being distant during our good mornings, ignoring my texts, prioritizing hobbies (he does jujitsu for the majority of the week and will often prefer to partake in that or other sports than seeing me), which of course is fine, but believe me, ITS WEIRD! This emotional whiplash has gotten me so confused, so I brought it up to him a couple days ago, but nothing seemed to come of it.\n\nSome of you must be thinking; \"Just break up!\". I CANNOT DO THAT. Some reasons include; I love this boy so much and definitely am not at the point of leaving, (I also have diagnosed depression and anxiety and the loneliness would not do me well), we live in a small town, so he is in every one of my classes. We are also NEIGHBOURS. I do not have any friends to fall back upon (yes, i have friends, but they're not exactly good people to me, and I can't 'find a better crowd'. Its a very small school... so they kind of are the crowd).\n\nI love him so much, and I just want to understand what's been going on lately. I completely understand that the first step would be to communicate, but I've already done so, and this week would not be a good week to try again. I keep spoiling him with gifts, like flowers, hand written notes, jewelry, hoping it may help (I know its not, haha). Ive been as supportive as I can with all of his extracurriculars. I just don't know whats been going on, or how to fix it. Help.\n\nTLDR: My boyfriend has been distant for a few months. In public, he avoids me and doesn't express PDA. In private, he can be very loving, kind, and the relationship is normal. He doesn't prioritize me. He has ASPD and I have depression. Breaking up is not an option. Do you have any insight for me?",

That’s when I also started working in my field. It’s a healthcare related career. After our lease ended and he graduated, he had a job lined up in Texas. I decided to live with my parents and he decided to move and take the job in Texas. I understand that he had to do what is best for him. We wanted to maintain our relationship. I continued working in California and living with my parents, though it started to become difficult for us to do long distance. I decided to move to Texas to be with him. I found a new job out there and started grad school too. My program was a year and a half and it is coming to an end. I initially thought moving to Texas may make him consider if he wanted to be with me long term or not. Before moving, I made it very clear of what I want for my future in a relationship and my reasons for moving out there. He knew I want to be engaged sooner rather than later, especially moving for our relationship. He agreed and we seemed to be on the same page. \nFast forward to today, we are not engaged/ at the point in our relationship that I had hoped/ want us to be. I’m about to graduate, but I want to pursue my career in California rather than Texas. For my field, California has better opportunities and I would need a license in each state I practice in. Getting a license in CA would be a long/difficult process if I stay in TX. My boyfriend wants to stay in TX for at least another year for his job’s vesting period before looking for a new job. He is open to moving back to CA after that. He had told me he will propose within the next year and that I should trust him. I was sad and upset that he still never proposed to me after all this time. A part of me doesn’t know for sure if he will actually purpose in the timeframe he mentioned. I’m contemplating moving back to California to focus on myself and give him more to think about what he wants. Or should I stay in TX and get the license for my career here in hopes that he will propose soon and in hopes that we will eventually move back to California?\n\n\nTLDR/ tl;dr : My boyfriend hasn’t proposed to me in the timeframe I had imagined after moving to a new state for the relationship.

We are very close and I consider her one of my best friends. However, one of her biggest flaws is that she always needs the attention to be on her in a group setting. She’s great one-on-one, we have fun together and have supported each other through our roughest times. But when she gets around large groups, I cannot stand her. She’ll very obviously flirt with men and then be shocked when they start to like her. She blatantly flirted with my ex in front of me (not because she likes him but because his attention was on me and she would do anything for it to be on herself) but she’ll do these things in a strategically subtle way where if someone points it out they’ll look the crazy one. \n\nThe worst thing for me about this is birthdays. We went to dinner for my birthday last year and she had recently broken up with her boyfriend. She told me the story earlier that day, and she didn’t seem sad at all about it, at least outwardly.  At dinner, she decided to spill the news about the breakup to the rest of the group, and spent basically the whole dinner talking in detail about the story. I left feeling really unappreciated but didn’t say anything because I wanted to be there for her. Last week was another one of my friends’ birthday and we went to dinner. She had been apartment hunting for a while and recently found a suitable apartment to move into. Again, she told me this earlier in the day and she showed me the virtual tour and talked in detail about the location, looked at it on Google earth, etc. But then at dinner, she decided to drop the news that she found a new apartment to the group and everyone asked to see it and she ended up giving everyone the virtual tour again on her phone, until we got our food which was about 45 mins. Meanwhile it seemed like no one was paying any attention to the birthday girl. I tried diverting the topic to ask the birthday girl something and my friend always found a way to bring the conversation back herself. The frustrating part is that I feel like I’m the only one who sees it happening - everyone else indulges in her behavior. \n\nWell, my birthday is coming up next week and we are all going to dinner. She will just have gotten back from a big trip to a national park. I have been feeling kind of down and unappreciated lately and I am just afraid that my entire birthday dinner is going to revolve solely around her trip, and everyone will want to hear all about her trip and it won’t even feel like a birthday dinner. I want to know how I can handle this - is there a way that I can not indulge in her story to make her tell it faster or for it to not be the main topic of conversation? Any tips on how to handle this?\n\nTLDR: My friend has a habit of always redirecting a conversation back to herself and her life, particularly on days centered around other people, like birthdays. How do I prevent this on my upcoming birthday?",

Both work full time and saving to buy a house. \n\n\nTL;DR, Our fights for the last two if not more years have been the same over and over. Fight topics: He thinks I’m mean to him, don’t show him enough affection, don’t see each other enough, I always have something wrong with my health, I say things too blunt, always do what I want, never check in on him ect.. \n\n\nThe main issue is his communion in this relationship he’s the type of person to hold everything in and blow up out of the blue or play the silent game when he’s upset. Me on the other hand I say it like it is regardless of who I’m talking to. I’m in therapy and we talk about the relationship sometimes and I feel like she gives me good advice. (No my boyfriend would never go) Good communication takes two people and I know this is something we must work on. \n\n\nI’ve taken all of my money out of our house account because I can’t buy a house with someone who doesn’t know how to communicate when things are wrong in a relationship without always pointing blame, starting a bigger argument or playing the silent game. I would say on average we fight 1-2 times a month over these same topics. I’m really at a loss. ",

His dad was very emotionally abusive towards me and I couldn't even call to wish him a happy birthday. I was a bit sad yesterday.\n\nBut anyway, I don't know why I was feeling so down yesterday and even crying.\n\nMy fiance I have been with for tqo years said something (nothing mean) and I started crying, I felt very emotional yesterday. He came to me and asked me so many times what is wrong. I said I don't know I just feel a little bit down but it doesnt have something to do with you. He asked again and I said I don't know, he left the room after that and has been quiet/not talking all evening until he went to bed. He still cooked (his day) and asked me to eat and kissed my foreead goodbye innthe morning today. He also didn't even mention my son's birthday yesterday. He knows the date and the importance of it to me.\n\nSo today I did apologize to him for not speaking up about how I was feeling and being distant. I told him why I was sad, I apologized for not voicing it, explained why and told him it wasn’t fair to him. I see it was a pretty shitty move of me. I also got a babysitter for saturday for a concert he had been talking about so we could have some time. He said haha ok, and told me how much he suffers when he sees me unhappy.\n\nWell after that he posted a tiktok video on his whatsapp status talking about when people don’t see your efforts, we were meant to celebrate my son today and I had gotten cake etc and waited for my fiance to sit with us after he had finished his shower after work. He just sat, ate his cake, starring into the table, and then went to the bedroom without a word and slept until way after my son went to bed around 9 PM. I went out bowling with my son alone after my fiance slept from 5 PM. \n \nMind you we work the same hours, woke up the same time and I slept two hours later than him last night.\n\nWhat can I do to make it better? I feel even more unhappy now and my stomach is paining from it all. Told him how it hurts but nothing since.\n\nTl;dr: my fiance didn't understans why I was upset yesterday when I pushed him away. I apologized today and now henis pushing me away and I don't know what to do?",

      "content": "I’ve been in a relationship for a while and I honestly don’t know if what I’m experiencing is emotional abuse or if I’m just not strong enough. I’ve left and gone back so many times that I feel ashamed just saying that. But it’s affecting me so deeply that I had to write this out somewhere.\n\nWhen we first got together, he was so loving. He told me I was everything. People around me said I’d hit the jackpot. I believed them. But slowly, things began to shift, and I didn’t even notice how much I was changing to survive being around him.\n\nHere’s what I’ve been going through:\n\t•\tHe started criticizing how I talk, how I sit, how I look at him, how I even blink sometimes. He says I look “attacking” without saying anything. That my tone is disrespectful even when I’m just trying to explain.\n\t•\tHe constantly says I don’t have manners, that I’m not cultured, or that I don’t come from a good enough background. He even once gave me an old-fashioned etiquette book and suggested I “start from the basics” and stop wasting time on my interests.\n\t•\tHe makes me feel like I’m always failing. He doesn’t say it outright, but the way he acts, it’s like he truly believes I’m beneath him. It’s not even manipulative at this point—it feels like he’s just disgusted by who I am.\n\t•\tHe often says I can’t be a part of a “real family” like his. That I wouldn’t last in his home. That I was raised wrong and that’s why I behave the way I do. These aren’t heat-of-the-moment things. He says them like facts. And after a while, I’ve started believing it.\n\t•\tIf I bring up how I feel, he says I’m being too emotional, or that I’m playing the victim. If I say nothing, I’m giving attitude. If I ask a question, I’m challenging him. It’s like no matter what I do, I’m wrong.\n\t•\tHe blocks me whenever we argue. He shuts me out, disappears, and then waits for me to chase him, apologize, and fix it. And I always do. I can’t help myself. It’s like I’m addicted to proving to him that I’m not what he says I am.\n\t•\tHe’s extremely close to his mother, and I’ve always been made to feel like I’m competing with her. If I try to speak up about how I feel about that dynamic, I’m told I’m disrespecting his family. Meanwhile, I’ve felt guilty for even wanting time with my own parents.\n\t•\tHe’s never once apologized for anything, even when he’s been cruel. He once punched a mirror during a fight and said it was “because of me.” When I get upset, he mocks me or just tells me I need to calm down. I feel like my emotions are used against me every time.\n\t•\tThere have been times he’s gotten in my face, raised his voice, said things I still hear in my head days later. Things like how I need to learn my place, or that I shouldn’t speak unless I know how to. Even when I cry, he acts like I’m putting on a show.\n\t•\tHe’ll be loving again, and just when I think things are okay, he’ll find something small to fight about and say it’s over again. It’s like he breaks up with me every time I forget to keep my head down.\n\t•\tI’ve tried to leave more times than I can count. I’ve lasted a few hours, maybe a day. Then I’m right back—texting him, apologizing, trying to calm him down. I hate that I do it. I feel pathetic. I feel like I’m addicted to him.\n\nI’m scared that I’ll be stuck in this cycle forever. That I’ll never be able to leave for good. And I’m so mentally worn out. I’m an only child. I would never do anything to hurt myself, but this has affected me so much that I’ve had some really dark thoughts. I don’t even recognize myself anymore.\n\nPlease be kind. Please don’t judge me. I already feel so much shame. I just need to know—is this abuse? Or am I just not strong enough to handle a difficult relationship?\n\nI feel like I’m disappearing.\n\nTL;DR: My boyfriend is verbally and emotionally abusive. I keep going back to him even though I feel broken and scared, and I don’t know how to leave.\n",

Like choose everything and everyone over me. Well we got back together he promised things would change. They haven’t. Still no job. I haven’t seen him in 2 weeks. He lives 20 mins from me and isn’t busy but says he is. I’m so tired of asking hey when can I see you? Like he says he loves me and he text me all day everyday but I want more than that I want a real relationship with a future not a pen pal. I’m honestly not happy with how things are. A few days ago I had a guy I dated a few times a few years ago message me asking how I was and we’ve been messaging ever since. He honestly is everything I want in a guy and when we dated I ran away bc I wasn’t ready for what he wanted at the time but now I feel like we are on the same page. I feel like an absolutely terrible person for even talking to him while I’m in a relationship. He knows the situation and we’ve only talked. Of course he’s trying to persuade me his way bc he says he still cares about me always has and always will. He was able to recall everything I ever told him and every detail of every date we had. Definitely surprised me he cared that much to remember everything. But I do feel so guilty bc I do love my boyfriend but I know in my heart he’s never going to be able to be who I need him to be. He says he’s trying but never put anything into action. He’s constantly jumping from one thing to another. He changes his mind like he changes underwear and it makes me an absolute wreck. Because I like stability and consistency. I know what I need to do but I’m having such a hard time going through with it bc I do love him and I don’t want to hurt him but his empty promises are slowing tearing away at me. \n\nTL;DR!

      "content": "I’m a 38-year-old man in a 12-month relationship with a woman (33F) who is kind, calm, and easy to be with. There’s no drama. On paper, it looks stable—no fighting, shared values, and a mutual desire to start a family. She came out of a 10-year relationship before this; I’ve had a few short to medium-term ones.\n\nBut emotionally and physically, I feel increasingly disconnected.\n\nThere’s very little passion. We barely kiss, sex is rare, and I hardly feel physical desire toward her anymore. In the beginning, we were more sexually active—but I was always the one initiating. Over time, I’ve lost interest. When we do have sex, it feels quiet, passive, and emotionless. No playfulness, no sounds, no intensity. So far this year, we’ve only had sex 5–6 times.\n\nTo clarify: my libido is fine. I feel sexual desire in general and find other people attractive. So I’m confident this isn’t a physical issue—it’s specific to *this* connection.\n\nThere’s also a lack of emotional depth. Our conversations mostly stay on the surface. She never asks how I’m feeling, and she rarely shares much about herself. There are no emotional check-ins, no real curiosity. I handle all the planning—meals, activities, social events. She goes along with things but almost never initiates. It feels like I’m carrying the energy for both of us.\n\nOne moment that really stuck with me:  \nHalfway into the relationship, my pet (who meant the world to me) passed away. I was devastated. She was physically present, but emotionally absent—no questions, no comfort, just surface-level distraction. She never asked how I was doing or offered to help in any way. And I don’t think it came from cruelty—I think it’s emotional avoidance or fear of vulnerability.  \nThat moment made me realize how alone I actually felt, even in a relationship.\n\nWe had a conversation afterward (which I initiated) where I said clearly that I couldn’t be in a relationship without real communication or emotional openness. I told her it didn’t feel like we were where we should be after that amount of time. She was sad, but also receptive—and even suggested we start having weekly check-ins every Sunday. I agreed, thinking it was a great idea.\n\nFast forward a few months… and we haven’t had a single check-in.  \nIt’s clear: if I don’t initiate, nothing happens.\n\nNow I’m torn.  \nPart of me wants to try—to rebuild intimacy, passion, and connection. Maybe, with focus and mutual effort, something real could still grow.  \nBut another part of me wonders: if I have to work *this* hard just to feel something... maybe it’s just not there. Maybe it never really was.\n\nHas anyone been in a relationship that felt more like habit than love?  \nWere you able to turn it around—or did you realize it was better to let go?\n\nTL;DR:  \nIn a stable, drama-free relationship with someone kind—but there’s no passion, emotional depth, or initiative. I do all the work, and I feel alone in the connection. Wondering if this can be rebuilt, or if I’m just holding onto something that isn’t truly love.",

      "title": "Should I (F17) try to improve things with my boyfriend (M17) or not, context:",
      "content": "ok, so basically my bf and I have been dating for like 5 months, and over the last week I've been thinking if I really want to be in a relationship. We are both 17, but he dropped out of school and is working, and I'm still in school and am very, very busy with extracurriculars and studying in my last year of high school. So we see each other usually once or twice every week or 2, but we mainly communicate through snap videos, just so it's like a facetime, but whenever either of us are free, we can just open it and respond. But lately I've been a really bad girlfriend and not responded for a couple of days at a time, and I kind of blamed it on me being so busy because I have been in a musical that's gone on over the past month or so and which we only closed the other day. \n\nAnyways, to get to the point, idk if it's because of my raging adhd and the fact that I keep seeing the timer for how long he's been on delivered for as a deadline, but I'm the kind of person who physically and mentally shuts down when I'm stressed and I don't want to talk to anyone. \n\nHe's my first boyfriend, and I've had crushes before him, but the way we were talking before he asked me out was in a very friend-like kind of way, and I wouldn't say I had a crush on him when we started dating. We were just talking for so long (like months) that i kind of felt the pressure to date him (not to say i entirely didn't want to, i liked him to a point and had fun talking to him so i assumed that's what the relationship would kind of look like and since he's my first boyfriend i kind of had no clue on how a relationship works.)\n\nWe have a couple of things in common, and he's attractive and funny, and I obviously like him, but he keeps going on about going on trips away or how he's going to drive to see me when I move to uni next year, and i have big goals and ambitions, where I want to go places and pursue different things and hobbies and enjoy experiencing life, but he is more close minded with the fact of moving on to bigger things (I think mostly because he's already got a stable job and everything). He also brought up the idea of sex when I was drunk and he was driving me home, but I didn't really respond because I was uncomfy and one thing that really kind of freaked me out was that he told my friend (when he was drunk so take it with a grain of salt) that he's \"in this for marriage\". Like he's moving too fast for me, and I think it's selfish of me if I can't give him the attention and time he deserves. He's a really lovely person and I do enjoy spending time with him it's just that I don't think our relationship is sustainable in the way he probably thinks it is.\n\nThe catalyst for me beginning to think this way was recently when we were together he was telling me about how much he thinks about me, especially when we are seeing each other that day and how excited he gets, which I said the same for me, because no confrontation means everyone is happy right. But I began to feel really bad about not feeling the same way and I know I don't put as much effort into the relationship as him and he really is trying, but I just feel like I'm being toxic and selfish in not communicating these things but at the same time i literally cannot.\n\nSome other things;\n\n\\- sometimes he gets a bit to touchy or wants physical affection and that's fine and this is entirely my fault for not saying anything, but i hate confrontation more than anything in the entire world, and i can tell he gets a bit off when he hints at a kiss and i don't give one. I am just not a big physical person\n\n\\- whenever I'm alone with him, i still feel a little uncomfy and not entirely comfortable with him as i feel like i should be in an almost 6 month relationship\n\n\\- everyone says we are such a cute couple and that we are perfect together, so if i was to end things with him out of the blue many people would talk (small town ya know)\n\n\\- my best friend's boyfriend is one of his best friends, so that would be a tad awkward \n\n\\- i feel like i should just thug it out and see what happens, but i also think we just aren't as close as we should or could be.\n\n\\- this might've just been all because of stress and not communicating...\n\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\n\\- I've been dating my boyfriend for 5 months, but lately I've been questioning if I actually want to be in this relationship. \n\n\\- We're both 17,  he's out of school and working, and I'm in my final year with a packed schedule. We barely see each other and mostly talk over Snapchat.\n\n\\- I’ve been distant lately, partly due to stress, adhd, and just shutting down under pressure.-\n\n\\- He’s sweet and tries hard, but I feel like he’s more emotionally invested, talking about the future, marriage, and sex, while I still don’t feel fully comfortable with him. I never had strong romantic feelings from the start (we just kind of slid into dating.)\n\n\\- I hate confrontation, so I haven’t told him any of this, but deep down I feel we might not be compatible long-term.",

Found out today that my sister's cancer diagnosis is a lot worse than what we thought. When I was still in the room talking to the doctor, I texted my boyfriend (24M) telling him my sister's 2 years life expectancy. Well, he did reply though telling me that I needed to stay strong, and that's about it.\n\nWhen I came out of the doctor's room, the first thing I really wanted to do is to cry out, talk, and call my boyfriend, and that is when I found out that he had started a game with his friends and couldn't talk to me for the until 2 hours later.\n\nMy boyfriend told me that had I told him to stop playing his games to call and talk to me, he would have. Although I can't help but to feel disappointed as I had expected him to offer me emotional support without me needing to ask. Not only did he not offer, he proceeded to occupy himself with games.\n\nHe has always been a gamer, but he didn't game as much when he first met me and has only gotten back into gaming when the honeymoon period died down. We have been dating for slightly over a year now. \n\nIdk, I am so heartbroken right now by what had just happened. This is the third time I am so disappointed as I had not received any emotional support from him during this entire time when my sister had to undergo surgery which heavily impacted my mental health too. I'm not sure if I'm overly emotional and irrational right now due to the series of events that have happened, but I really feel like giving up on this relationship. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated.\n\nTldr; my boyfriend (24M) was busy playing games when I (23F) needed emotional support as my sister has been diagnosed with cancer. I feel like giving up on this relationship.",

      "title": "My boyfriend is losing his love for me",
      "content": "Hello, I am sorry if I make mistakes as english is not my first language and I am currently holed up in my work office, crying.\n\nYesterday, my bf of two years dropped a bomb on me: he feels like he was not so ready for a committed relationship (he is 25M and barely experienced life like different partners, travel, diff jobs etc) when I'm 28F and I have traveled for 8 years and had quite a few relationships, situationships, you name it.\n\nWe both know that what we have is rare and great but lately, Bf has been slipping into a more depressive state due to work and responsibilities. When I met him, he was doing season work and living at his parents, and I took him traveling, and we moved together into an apartment in another city. This adulting was quite new for him and I knew back then that eventually he would feel like it was a lot or he was missing out on his twenties. However, he always assured me that he loved me more than anything and would follow me anywhere.\n\nSide note: he struggles with depressive episodes and is very lost in life. I am trying to be supportive but sometimes it is a lot and he refuses therapy.\n\nThe last couple weeks, he has been distant with me. He usually takes care incredible care of me and is very onto me, and I am the one more independent. His new job got him new friends, which Im so happy about and smh I felt like our lives were more balanced (we live in my hometown so I have a lot of friends and family around but he did not). I went for a weekend trip with friends that he knows very well but he could not come due to work on saturday. I let him know about my endeavours as usual, and he went out with his work friends. During the evening, I felt weird - his messages were scarce which is not like him at all. I felt insecure for the first time in almost two years, but I buried the feeling and said nothing, because there was no rational reason to freak out.\n\nNow two weeks later, we just had amazing sex that I initiated ( I know I recently got lazy on that part too so trying to make an effort) and he says:\n\n\\-I am feeling trapped, and I am uneasy when thinking that I will never flirt, never get to know anyone else\n\n\\-I feel like roomates lately and our routine is too much to handle, I feel flat\n\n\\-and finally, he says that he has a crush on a work colleague and that he's been distant because he feels shitty towards me.\n\nNB: he is very loyal and respectful, so he did not act on it. Just feeling that crush already drove him crazy.\n\nSo I told him that if our life was too serious, we could kick it and do something else - I KNEW his age when getting with him and his background, and I always told him I was ok doing something else. But he struggles to tell me what he wants, he only talks about what he does not want and I don't want him resenting me because I always decide so I am waiting on him deciding something. (I am happy with my life now though).\n\nI told him that indeed, we had a routine of flatmates. We need to go on more dates, do couple activities, not just hang at the flat or with friends and that I was absolutely willing to start doing that\n\nAnd for the crush, even though it hurt bad, I admitted that I had some crushes too. The thing is, it's easy to crush on the next new thing. Usually its sparkles in your eyes and then something makes you understand they're not compatible with you. My little crushes would always go away in a couple weeks naturally, because what I have with bf is so much bigger, stronger, more beautiful and I love him so much. Being slightly attracted to someone else cannot shake that for me.\n\nHe was surprised by my revelation and took it in for a while, understanding where I was coming from. He offered to change jobs to get distance with her to which I said, if you like your job, don't do.\n\nWe then spent the entire evening crying, consoling each other. He would say things like 'if we separate for a little while, then we will find each other better'. He misses missing me and I understand that. We also talked about how when he goes out, he feels the need to come home to me early and feels frusrtated. And I was actually mad at this one because we are party people and I never put pressure on him in that regard. He says he does not want me to be alone home but I said im fine with me-time (im a geek too so i usually use the time to play). I feel like he puts a lot of unrealistic expectations on himself, he has this idealistic idea of love and what a couple is so for him getting a crush was shattering. I am from a different background so I am more open to listening and understanding that this things happen, you can't control it but what defines you is how you act on it.\n\nI have barely slept and I'm sick, trying to give him some space this day but even through the few messages we sent, I can feel he is distancing himself lots.\n\nWe decided for now to keep going on and reflect on a solution or things to put in place in the upcoming months and reconvene this conversation next weekend. We don't want to rush and yesterday was madly emotional. But I don't know what to do: give him space, accept the break? I feel too anxious and rejected to be initiating much but maybe I should push myself? I am so very lost and every thing he does that is not his usual caring self hurts me deep. He was crying so much yesterday, saying he felt like an asshole and that he loved me still and would see a future with me but that he felt like it was all a lot now (which he never mentioned before). Anyway I will stop rambling, sorry for the extensive post and thank you to anyone who will take the time to read\n\n  \nTL;DR! My boyfriend of two years is losing his love for me, and I do not know what to do",

We have cultural differences. He is british i am Latvian/Russian/Danish ( fun mix ) .\n\nHe have shoulder and knee problems, that do give him some pain through the day, He is though very active 8-10 hous a day. And do his rehab when he can. This just kind of adds to the fire.\n\nWhen something happens, f.eks he needs to do tax return, his cars breaks sounds weird, his bank needs some papers etc. Basicly everything admin is stressing him out. There is other things too, but you get the point.\n\nThe problem is, its always me that gets the snappy side of him. When he is stressed or frustrated, he snaps at me. He is not mean or yells, mostly just gets annoyed with me really fast and snaps, especally with my english, as its far from my native language. But coming from violent home, it does make me scared, cause i do not see it coming nor i am deserving of this. He knows he have this problem, cause other ex's have been saying the same. Like he says, he knows its wong but i am just there and he cant stop him self. And i am also well aware i am very emotional and easy to tears, that dont make this easy.\n\nI do understand life can be hard and i try to be very patien and try not react, but after 3 days of constant snapping, you just cant hold the tears back. I am opposite of that, if i am stressed, you cant feel it on me, cause my problems is nobody elses problem.\n\nHow do i make him want to not be snappy with me. What to say to give him the right tools to learn to handle his stress. Is there anything to do? \n\nSorry for my bad english. :D\n\nTL;DR: Frustrated that i do not know how to make him see that he needs to be more aware of his stress managment.   \n",

I have a kid of 6 years and I was not particularly looking for a relationship when I met him . He was living with his partner (ex) [F31] and they have been togtehr for more than 12 years . And when  me and boyfriend met . In a couple of months we started doing more stuff together . Like he started doing a lot of activities together and we both visited each other and I introduced him to my son after 6 months of being in the relationship . I as well noticed that me and him both are not happy in a polyamorous relationship and it causes a lot of friction between us . I told him end of October (after a lot of self assessment and reflection for few months with my therapist etc) that I want to be monogomous . He said he wil need some time and after couple of months in January he broke up with his long term partner that now his ex that he still lives with .\n\nAnd after the break up they continued doing everything togtehr like dance classes ( they started dance classes because I asked him to take up a dance classes with me he said she has been asking it for a long time so I had to wait until they started it until I started dancing with him when they both were stil togtehr ) And they shared they same bed room . This all got to me and I told him this is all very tough on me . And I told him he cancelling plans with me to show up for her .\n\nAnd because I told him I needed space in February to think about the situation . He broke up with me as I was taking this space to think about the situation .  ( and ever since then I am not allowed to visit him in his home and after a long fight he role me I can visit when she is not there , that’s may be once per week in the day and may be once a year or so when she is travelling )\n\nAnd we got back together immediately after a week . We both are driven in the relationship by the fear of him spending time with her when we take a break or when we stay away and do our things and he is afraid to share things that he does with her or share because he is afraid of her reaction .\n\nThey still live in the same home . I do believe that the dynamic between them has changed and I do believe that they can be good friends . I think they both are codependent on each other .\n\nAnd I am not in a mental place to live with anyone or i also denied that I idea that he brought up about moving in with me .  We both go to couples therapy (on my request ) to get out of this toxic cycle of fighting with each other . And screaming at each other .\n\nThe moment I start to regulate myself alone and take space form him . He does things with her like going out for lunch etc ,.\n\nI do not know how much energy do I have to give him the space to process his breakup with his ex and move out of the home ( that he denies doing ) and he stil goes for dance class with her and then after the dance class they go out for dinner like a routine every week ..\n\nI feel miserable not being able to manage or regulate myself to manage this . I do know that I know better than sitting at my home hoping that he comes back to me and be fair to me in the relatsionhip .\n\nOn the other hand it hurts that he doesn’t open up and discuss why it’s important for him to do all of this . The more I am in this relatsionhip my self worth feels like is going down .\n\nI do love him .i am not sure if anybody can come out of this transition phase stronger together . I am losing hope sometimes . Any advice would be appreciated .\n\nTL;dr\n\nTransitioned from poly to mono with my partner [M37] . And he stil lives with his ex and goes dancing and plans stuff and goes out for lunch etc ,. I feel lost I do not know where I stand . Can these transitions really work ? ",

I was the one who dumped him because I got emotionally drained of our fights, mainly the problem was his jealousy that isolated me from friends and the life I once lived. \n\nDuring the breakup he said that we can move past it, we can fix it and that he feels different about those things now. I just didn’t understand how he feels different about those things because he never sat down and talked to me about it during the relationship, apologized or took accountability. I was very crushed by that and said I wasn’t breaking up because of not having feelings anymore, but because I can’t trust that he will be different. \n\nAfter that he hit me up once again that he wants to talk and “ask me some questions”, and I panicked and said I will talk to him when I’m ready because I’m still vulnerable and he agreed to it. \n\n\nMy guilt grows over time for not giving him a second chance but I really thought that it was over. I admit that I was wrong because it clearly is not over for me, and I failed in my judgement. I’m fucking stupid but I want to do what’s right. If it means we are for each other I will fight for it. \n\nPlease if anyone got back together after the breakup with their partner, please do share your experience.\n\nTLDR: Broke up with my bf of 5 years due to his jealousy and lack of accountability.

She is sweet, loving, and kind and seemingly perfect in all regards except in some conversations. \n\nFor example, when I want to talk to her about something I find really important she doesn’t respond to what I say but rather goes on to talk about a related story or idea. She doesn’t ask questions about what I say, either. Like if I say something like, “Yeah I totally get it my day was kind of bad as well” she won’t really inquire about it or acknowledge it she just keeps on talking about her day. Also, She never rants about beliefs or things she likes, it’s all memories or stories about her childhood. Today is my birthday, and she called me and wished me happy birthday and proceeded to talk about how her birthdays in her 20s have been. It’s confusing, because she had just sent me a long text talking about the present moment and how she is grateful I’m in her life. \n\nDon’t get me wrong, I don’t mind having conversations not be about me (I work with the elderly so that’s my daily work life, lol)! I’m just confused how her actions (she spends so much time making sure i’m happy) and her written words feel so real and focused, but her conversational patterns and what i know she’s trying to express just do not make sense. \n\nWe talked about this once before; I asked her why she does that and emphasized I don’t think it’s bad, I just don’t fully understand it. She says it’s her way of relating to me, but I feel uncomfortable just going back and forth interrupting each other with stories, as my natural conversational rhythm is to ask people questions, silently listen, and wait for my turn to respond to what they’re saying, and them naturally asking questions like “what about you, do you relate?” \n\nMy questions are: Should I try to adjust to her way of having conversations? and if not, how do I approach talking about this with her in a polite, constructive way? Why do you think she does this? \n\nTLDR: My girlfriend dominates conversations talking about her life, particularly past experiences, and does not ask me questions. She expresses herself well through text and other acts but not verbally. I don’t know what to do. ",

He hates calling and due to schedules I only see him once a week. He is someone who could probably be totally fine not having a relationship and if anything would probably prefer the alone time. On top of this he is very much laid back and prior to our break I brought up that I need more for this relationship to work. I want him to plan dates for us every now and then, surprise me with flowers once in awhile, and just put more effort into me. He is a very supportive kind person and I love him but I need change for this to work. A part of me feels like this is just who he is and maybe I do deserve someone who is more like me but I also don’t want to give up on him. He said he is willing to change and work on himself during this break, but I am worried of the possibility that nothing will change. I say this because he told me his exes brought up the same issues. He is truly a great guy and I don’t want to give up on him but I worry we are incompatible.

      "content": "I’ve been in a long-distance relationship with my boyfriend (25M) for 8 months now. I’m 19. There’s a noticeable age gap, and while I initially thought he’d be more emotionally mature because of that, it’s been the opposite.\n\nEvery-time we have a quarrel he told me he uses Snapchat to talk to people “just for fun” and not in a flirty way—he insists it’s not just girls, but still, it bothers me. I don’t mind him having friends, but when he uses his free time to talk to others while I sit there missing him, it makes me feel like I’m not important. I told him this directly, asking him if he really thinks it’s fair that I’m just expected to stay silent and accept it.He told me that even when im talking to others he’s fine with it because that he trusts me and not he doesn’t feel like this is a threat to our relationship and told me not all people are always talking with others just to flirt but on Snapchat? Okay i don’t buy that to be honest but he also doesn’t look like he’s cheating as well.\n\nInstead of addressing how I feel, he always says the conversation is going in “loops” and shuts it down. It’s incredibly frustrating. I’m not being controlling—I just want reassurance and to feel like a priority. But every time I try to express my feelings, he gets defensive, changes the topic, or emotionally shuts down completely. He always tell me he’s busy i know he is but has time to talk to other people what me?\n\nI’m starting to believe he might have an avoidant attachment style. He’s told me in the past that he doesn’t really talk about his feelings, even when he’s going through something. But it’s affecting me. I always have to be the one initiating emotional conversations, and I constantly feel like I’m “too much” for having basic emotional needs.\n\nThe age gap, his emotional unavailability, and the fact that I’m always the one trying to resolve things—it’s becoming too heavy. I feel like I’m talking to a wall, and I’m starting to wonder if this is what I want or deserve in a relationship. He actually sometimes shows that he loves me and I am also moving there for my abroad study plan so I don’t know what to do….\n\n⸻\n\nTL;DR:\nI’m (19F)in a long-distance relationship with my 25M boyfriend who uses Snapchat every-time we quarrel to casually talk to others (including girls), and it makes me feel unimportant. Every time I try to express my feelings, he avoids the conversation and says it’s “going in loops.” I think he has an avoidant attachment style, and I’m emotionally drained from always being the one to bring up serious topics while he shuts down. Not sure how much more I can take.",

She said yes. \n\nI asked, so you sleep every night believing you'll go to hell? She said yes. And I don't know how that made me feel. I mean, I am spiritual. But I believe that God, supports love. And so I know the God I believe in would not punish me for being in love with a fellow woman. \n\nBut at the same time, this leaves me thinking, will she eventually just up and go? Once she decides she's done with sinning? And is all the future we planned going to go out the window? What do yall think? Am I overthinking? I just kinda think that's a Red flag ish. Cause I am now feeling not secure in the relationship.  Idk.

      "content": "I (F19) would like to hear from people if theyve felt the same. I just want to know if these feelings are normal.  \n\nI’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year. I really like him. He’s smart, sweet, funny, and incredibly kind. He’s getting his PhD, he treats me so well, and he really *loves* me. We get along great, we have chemistry, he gets along with my family. In so many ways, he’s everything I should want.\n\nBut here’s the thing: sometimes I love him… and sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I’m so excited to see him, like he’s all I want. Other times, I feel completely indifferent. It feels like a chore to hang out. I’ve felt like this since the beginning, off and on. It comes in waves. And it’s *not* anything he does. It just happens. Maybe it’s hormonal (with girls 28 day cycles lol), maybe it’s just me, but it makes me feel awful.\n\nHe was the first one to say “I love you,” about a month into the relationship. I definitely wouldn’t have said it that early. hes only my second boyfriend so im not sure if thats normal to say it that early. He sometimes talks about a future together, and there are moments when I like that idea. But other times, it makes me feel trapped or uncertain. i dont *not* but i dont exactly see a future *with* him. I mean, its impossible predict the future, so i dont really like to think/talk about it. \n\n I wish I had butterflies, but mostly I just feel… I don’t know. Numb? Neutral? \n\nHe’s not exactly my physical “type” either. He’s super cute i do like the way he looks.  but sometimes I find myself fantasizing about someone else. I feel terrible even admitting that.\n\nIt’s not like I’m ashamed of my boyfriend. I’m not. I just keep thinking: shouldn’t I feel more than this? Shouldn’t I *want* to be with him all the time? I didn’t feel this kind of emotional rollercoaster with my ex, but maybe we just weren’t together long enough. Still, I was always excited to see him.\n\nI just want to feel that real, deep, overwhelming kind of love. The kind you see in movies like. I know that’s dramatic and unrealistic, but I crave that kind of passion. \n\nAnd I’m scared. I’m scared that if I leave J (my boyfriend) for someone who makes me feel that spark, I’ll regret it. What if I get my heart broken? What if I never find someone as good as him again? He’s honestly the full package: smart, stable, kind, emotionally available. I’m terrified of ruining something good because of a feeling I don’t even fully understand.\n\nI would *never* cheat. That’s not even a question. But I notice other guys. I don’t act on anything, and I don’t flirt, but I see people and wonder what it would be like. There’s one guy I recently met who I think is really cool, and I caught myself wishing *he* was my boyfriend. I’d never do anything with him, and honestly I’d just like to be friends, but it still makes me feel guilty.\n\nSometimes I wonder if I’m just afraid of settling. Not that I *think* I’m settling with J , but I worry that someday I’ll look back and think I missed out on the kind of love I actually wanted. And yet, if someone ever felt about *me* the way I’m feeling now about J, it would destroy me. I’d be devastated.\n\nI keep going through these apathetic, detached phases where I just feel nothing. and on bad days i feel straight up annoyed with him for no reason. And then they pass, and I feel more connected again. I really hope this is one of those phases that will pass soon. I just want to be excited again. I want to feel in love.\n\nBut is that *really* necessary? Is excitement even sustainable in a long-term relationship? Or is it more important to have someone who’s kind, loving, and consistent? \n\nJ and I have had hard moments, but we’ve worked through them. I really value that. I like being with someone I can solve problems with instead of just giving up. We come out stronger and more mature as a result.  That means a lot to me. I’m not the kind of person to walk away just because things get hard. But right now, I don’t know what I’m feeling. I just know that I feel torn, guilty, and confused.\n\nIf you’ve ever felt like this in a relationship? like you’re in something good, but you don’t always feel it. what did you do? Did the feelings come back? Did you leave and regret it?  Did anyone leave their partner and find someone who they were truly in love with? \n\nI just need to know if anyone else has been here.\n\nsorry this has been kind of a rant. i just dont know what to do :/ \n\n  \nTL:DR, I like by current boyfriend, but i dont love him. I wish i was more passionate and excited. I just want to know if this is normal in a relationship. Is being totally in love always necessary? Has anyone felt this way towards a partner?  ",

He is Muslim and I am Christian, but we are both nonpracticing. I love him and he loves me and we’ve spoken about a future together. We’ve agreed on raising our children to choose their own religion and he agreed to move back to my home town with me when I decide I’m over living in NY. We wanted to move in together, but decided not to because it would make his parents uncomfortable. I met his mom a few months ago and it was nice but felt like she was vetting me more than trying to get to know me. His dad would not acknowledge our relationship for the longest time and is depressed/not eating due to the relationship. He has met my parents and stayed at my family’s house for the holidays. I am afraid the rest of our lives is going to be a challenge. I am afraid his parents will never love me and will try to influence our relationship and choices at every step. He says they won’t but I don’t think he is being realistic. I am at the crossroads of breaking up with him or staying with him and committing to the idea that life might be hard with him but at least he’s an amazing parter/person. I am afraid of making the wrong choice and missing out on a life with someone else who may be better suited to me and whose family will accept me for who I am.

      "content": "How do I(23f) navigate and process my grief with my partner 25M)\n\nMy father passed suddenly last year. My partner and I were living in Alaska. We moved back to Colorado and now rent a home. Recently my grief has gotten worse. I find myself not wanting to hang out with him. I would rather be doing things on my own. I know this hurts him. I communicated with him that I’m struggling, but I’m worried it’ll push him away. I am easily irritable, crying, and sad. He gets upset and hurt when I tel him I don’t want to hang out(play video games, go on walks…etc).\n\nI went to church today, and I have found a safe space for me. A place where I don’t feel alone. A place where I don’t feel judged for needing time for myself.\n\nI was having a hard time yesterday(brothers graduation without my father present) and he brought up that we should have sex. I said no I don’t want to, then he got upset and said I owe him money for lunch. Something about that interaction pushed me to the edge. I want to lock myself away. I’ll be talking to him about something serious and he’ll just grab my boobs and try to touch me. I’m obviously not okay, and don’t know why he does this.\n\n——-\n\nThere are also other issues. Since my father died I have been overly concerned for my partners health(300lbs). He asks for help with diet, exercise…etc but complains when he has to do it. He has a fungal infection on his feet yet won’t go to the doctor. He let his ingrown toenail get infected and even though I was telling him he needs to go to the doctor he wouldn’t. He also struggles to brush his teeth regularly. I’m very concerned about his physical health and it scares me that I could also lose him due to this.\n\nTL;DR: I don’t know how I’m supposed to process my grief with a partner who does not seem mature in all aspects of life, but I also do care deeply and he has been there for me through this process, so how have you navigated grief while having a partner? Also issues related to his hygiene.",

      "content": "TL;DR : Fiance consistently rude and condescending since beginning of 5 year relationship when I am consistently nice. \n\nSo, my sister (27F) and her fiance (32M) live at my mom’s house with us. They have been together for 5 years. And lived together with us for 3. Ever since the beginning my sister has made it apparently clear that he always says he hates me and my mom which makes no sense for a variety of reasons, but especially because my mother provides for him and he is just rude in return. And he thinks it’s funny. \nAnyways tonight I was trying to let him know a pan was hot and to not touch it and he wouldn’t even acknowledge me then said sarcastically “oh yea the first thing I’ll do is touch the pans”. I was a bit upset by that because it felt unnecessarily rude. My mom then OFFERED (for free) for them to have our couch when they move, and he rolled his eyes instead of responding. Mind you they had just gotten home after a fun day so I don’t think anyone can justify this attitude. Even further for context, he is always rude. He makes rude jokes about me or at me about things that I do or say due to my diagnosed autism. And he constantly makes rude statements about my widowed mother who works insanely hard to keep this roof over our heads. He is extremely condescending and racist and misogynistic. My sister always used to stand up for me but she just excuses it when he does it. She even agrees with him now which hurts. But because I’m nice I still have tried tirelessly since they moved in to make small talk with him or engage with him about his interests yet he ignores me or finds a way to make a condescending joke about me. I’m nothing but nice and kind to him. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. Also should add before he ever moved in (first 2 years of their relationship) he literally didn’t say a word to me and I mean for EXTENDED periods of time like 6 hour family party’s would blatantly ignore me and not acknowledge my presence. But then other times he’s randomly nice to me or asks me a thoughtful question. It’s so confusing. But he still seems to do it in a idc I’m just asking cause I have to way. I know he hates me but I just don’t know why? ",

      "content": "hi everyone! Im desperate for answers. I really need help, like so bad. Questions are listed at the bottom. im going to dive in and give a detailed backstory, so this may be kinda long. I am 20 and my younger sister is 17. I am a college student. My parents are together and come from two different racial backgrounds (mom is white and dad is black). \n\nMy parents laid extremely high expectations for both me and my sister from the time we were in kindergarten. But, I noticed as I dove into a competitive sport at 8yrs old, the treatment between the two of us began drastically changing. My dad was very involved in this sport; I needed to practice everyday, that’s reasonable! As I got older, this sport grew into a monster, I was playing at the highest level and almost committed to the University of Georgia to play. So through highschool I struggled with super tough coaches (1 of which got fired from 3 highschools for mental abuse) so it was just a very heavy weight to carry at my age. There was no offseason so I was gone all summer for 3/4 summers straight, and every day after school was dedicated to practicing. I didnt mind this, but my mom is heavily dedicated to school. She would hammer down on me if i didnt have straight a’s in my all AP (advanced placement) classes. I had tutoring twice a week and ACT prep once a week. This was my life from ages 12-18. I quit my sport in april2023 and my dad was devasted, he immediately made me search for a job for that summer as soon as I got out of school, so i got a job working 5days a week at the ymca childrens center. In the moment I didnt mind any of this until I left for college. \n\nOnce I left for college in 2023, I decided I was going to major in computer engineering. My relationship with my parents was extremely rocky due to me wanting to explore and have some freedom without them. I ended up doing okay my first semester, but in February of 2024 i hit the darkest place ive been in my entire life and failed all of my classes, leading to my suspension from the university. I was in over my head in all of my classes. My parents were awful to me through the entire freshman year of college, never asking about my mental health. Only cared about my grades and told me to do some “soul searching”. I was forced to tell them in May2024 that I failed out and they were disappointed but acted sympathetic. Now that its been a year, im back in school at a community college seeking my associates degree and then I plan on returning to the engineering school at the same university this December. \n\nSince quitting sport (which was my dads thing), and failing school (which was my moms thing) i feel like both parents hold a significant amount of resentment towards me. When I was 16, i got my moms hand me down 2011 maxima, which I was EXTREMELY grateful for, took great care of and love it. I still drive this same car with huge damages to it from someone hitting me. I pay for my rent, gas money, and groceries, which I do feel like is a fair for a 20 year old to be paying. Ive had job after job since for the past 2 years.\nBut….\nMy sister, who is 17, got a brand new 2021 nissan altima last year. She has no pressure to be in any AP classes, she doesnt have a job, she doesnt play sports. She has no pressures in life, which has set her up for a great success in my opinion; she can seek out opportunities for herself without feeling forced by someone and like its a chore, she has picked up small hobbies in her free time. She goes to school, which shes late for all the time, comes home takes a shower and takes a nap. She stays in her room all the time, whereas I am always socializing with my parents. \nThis started from a young age. When I entered middle school, I wanted to wear makeup and my mom got me clear mascara and chapstick; when my sister entered 4th grade she had an entire youtube channel dedicated to makeup, she had an entire vanity of expensive makeup. She has a brand new furniture set in her room and I have old furniture that my granny gave us. These are just simple examples but i could go on forever with this. \n\nI love my younger sister to death, and I dont blame her. Sometimes she acts like a brat and looks down on me because I dont have some of the nice things like she has, or she’ll throw an insult at my car or my room saying its dirty but i dont mind because she doesnt know any better. I try not to resent her, its really hard. I do love her shes amazing and shes like my best friend but i have moments where I just have to be alone from my family. \n\nThe most significant time period of my life with my parents is when I decided I was not going to play my sport in college (march2023-aug2023 when i left for college). My dad became physically abusive on one occasion because I didnt have time to do the dishes in between me arriving home from school and having to leave for practice. I went to practice with a busted lip, bleeding nose, and huge bruise on my forehead. My younger sister saw, my mom wasnt home. My mom was physically abusive on multiple occasions and quite frequently prior to this incident, but i could hold her off. Obviously it was different than when my dad did it. Theyve never laid a hand on my sister other than a whoopin here or there when we were younger. \n\nI just moved home from college yesterday, so we decided to go out to eat for dinner. I was cheery and in a great mood, dressed for the occasion appropriately, making conversation the whole way, laughing and trying to be pleasant. My sister, sat with her airpods in, my mom had to buy her a new outfit since she didnt dress right, and she had a horrible attitude the entire time bc she (didnt want to spend her sunday doing this). She didnt even order food at the restaurant. When we sat down for dinner, my parents and I had a huge argument. I was discussing babysitting the family I have babysat for a little over a year now. When i left for college, I gave the family my sisters phone number in case they needed a babysitter. She babysat for them a handful of times. I have been scheduled to nanny for them 4 days a week this summer, and i offered her 1 day so she can make a little bit of money since shes not getting a job. At the dinner table she had an attitude about wanting to babysit 2 days instead of 1. I clapped back at her, since shes been bringing the energy down all day I was just sick and tired of it and i said maybe you should get a job if you want more money. Who has a brand new car and doesnt have a job. My parents got furious that I said that, their only explanation was that it was their decision to “parent how they want to parent”. They were infuriated with me, instead of with the child that has been ruining the entire day with her selfish attitude! \n\nI know that parenting style differs from older sibling to younger sibling, we are two different people so I completely understand that! I just dont feel like its normal for me to feel this way, and I don’t feel like this is traditional or normal. My whole family has tons of built up resentment towards each other, with my grandparents, aunts uncles cousins etc.\n\nNow that you guys know my whole life story!!! 😂\n\nQuestions : \n- I am absolutely terrified to pass this treatment down to my children. How can I prevent this? \n- I want to live a happy, successful life. Should I seek therapy to help deal with all of the emotions and baggage this brings? \n- I do love my parents even though its been really hard. It would be hard, financially, to cut them out. How can I deal with this moving forward? \n- am i incorrect for feeling some resentment towards my sister?\n\n\ni just really need some kind words and motivation because I am crying writing this. I just dont understand how you could treat a real person like this for so long. I am not trying to play the victim. Sometimes i think its me, is it me? I dont understand why everything is targeted towards me. I tried to explain this in a non-bias way so that you guys could form your own opinions about it. Thank you guys for reading and I already appreciate you for taking the time to read all of this. 🩷 \n\ntl;dr Ive been dealing with the drastic differences of my parents parental style between my sister and I for 10 years. \n",

      "title": "Struggling to trust my (33F) partner (35M)",
      "content": "hello all, sorry for the throw away, I don't want my partner to see this.\n\nMy partner (35M) and myself (33F) have been in a relationship for 5.5 years. During that time, I have had many conversations about the fact he doesn't 'hear' me. eg we'll be watching TV and I will say his name, or something, and he will not even flinch. I have waited minutes at a time. When I ask again he briskly will answer me, or just say \"yeah yeah\". It makes me feel like a nag. I think in his mind he has already responded to me, so when I ask a second time, he is annoyed that I am bothering him.  \n  \nWhen I have had this conversation with him, he says that when he is watching TV, \"nothing and no one else exists\" and so he cant \"see me\" in the black void around the screen. I asked him if our dog is there in his visions, and he says \"yes\", but I am not there too -- hence why he doesn't register that I have said anything.\n\nFor years now, this has made me feel like I am talking to myself, or a blank wall, and doesn't feel very nice at all.\n\nover the past 3 years, we have lived together alone. he has an issue saving money, where the other year I was covering all bills. when he would say he'd like to contribute, I knew he didn't have loads of money, so I would ask him to instead put $50 towards our joint savings.\n\n9 months go by and I checked the savings account...nothing had been transferred, even when he told me he would. That made me feel awful and like I couldn't trust him to be honest with me.\n\nThen we went overseas saying \"don't worry baby, I've got you, money stuff is all sorted\", only to run out part way through (he didn't tell me earlier which would have allowed me to take money out of my savings app which takes 5 business days to clear into my account) and have to borrow money from his mum. Again, this felt like I couldn't trust him completely to follow through.\n\nThis year has been a lot. I have really wide feet and struggle to find dressy shoes I like. Finally, I found some and spent $300. The heel broke after a few weeks, and I got a refund. I could keep the shoes as they didn't have a replacement for me. As they were my only heels that I could wear, I of course kept them, and asked my partner to glue the chipped heel back on. He is a shoemaker and we have every kind of machine, glue, vice, and tool a footwear make could need in his workshop.\n\nHe knew how much I struggled with shoes, so he of course said \"I can fix those! it's easy, I will just buy a special glue.\" That was back in early February. it is now the end of May and the shoes have not been fixed, despite me very softly asking once a month to see when they might be ready. I am traveling to Europe in 9 days for my goddaughter's baptism, and these are the shoes I am planning to wear. I had asked him ages ago if he could fix it so that I could test them out to make sure they wouldn't break again straight away, He said \"of course\". Now, he still hasn't touched them or even remembered to do them. He said he would do it last Thursday but ended up resting and watching TV instead.\n\nI brought this up with him yesterday. That I feel hurt when he doesn't do the things he says he will (like wash the dog...it has been three months now). I know he is dyslexic -- I have ADHD and undiagnosed autism. I am the eldest daughter and grew up in an abusive home. I so badly thought that I could finally let my guard down and trust this man but it seems I can't and it is really breaking me from the inside.\n\nI am extremely empathetic towards his experience as a neurodivergent person. I offer to book his doctor appointments for him because I know he gets overwhelmed. I organise everything to do with our rental home. We recently moved house after getting an intention to sell notice. He was overwhelmed and I didn't want him to be, so I took on all the house hunting and he liked one! so I pushed through and got us the house he wanted (he needed a big workshop). I handled all realestate stuff, all safety inspections, telling the real estate all the things that are wrong with the house, while also trying to manage my small business that I am always stressed about, on top of trying to make money to actually pay rent.\n\nHe started a new job where he works 4 days a week as a design and technology assistant in a high school. I am glad he loves his job! I am really really happy. I had spent hours after my 12 hour work days to come and help him apply for jobs - long drawn out applications that I did happily because he was stressed and uncomfortable. I do all of these at the drop of a hat - because I know it took SO much energy to ask for the help... Sadly I don't feel like he applies that same mentality to me. He told me yesterday he 'doesn't mean to not care', it's just that I am not on his mental list, which felt like a punch in the gut.\n\nToday I woke up ugly crying while I tried to clean the kitchen because my body was reacting to the realisation that I don't feel I can trust him. It is hard to realise when you love the other person so much. He came out to ask what was wrong and I had to tell him, and that was heartbreaking. He is now very silent and went back to bed. I don't know how to navigate this without hurting his feelings.\n\nHe is very sensitive and I can be blunt, so for the past 6 months I have been sending my response texts to him through chat gpt first so I can ensure that I am not being rude or hurting his feelings.\n\nI am running out of energy and I don't know what to do or how to help. I have been struggling a lot since we moved into the new house. I organised everything, the removalists, the paperwork, all of it. We have now been here for 6 weeks and we're still drowning in boxes, some of which have sat in the exact same place as before. I have been piecing away at it, and he does too occasionally, but the bulk of it is just sitting there and even when I say \"can we unpack xxx together this weekend\", it is met with a \"maybe...\"\n\nI had a breakdown yesterday because everything is so gross and nasty in the house right now, and he said \"don't worry, we have 4 weeks to sort it out\" (as in, before I come back from Europe), and its making my feel crazy because it shouldnt be too much to ask that the bathroom gets a decent clean up after he shaves everywhere. I am so stressed and anxious and need to relax, but he doesn't see why it would be nice for us to have a clean space now, and not just later.\n\nI am going crazy. He blames it on his dyslexia, but I think a lot of it is because he actually doesn't care to make me a priority. I am really struggling and don't know what to do anymore. Can anybody help with some advice?\n\nthank you\n\n  \nTLDR: my partner sdoesn't do the things he says he will, and doesn't notice me. Blames it on dyslexia but I feel a lack of care which has resulted in mistrust.",

At first I was catching feelings for her but had to nip that in the butt to prevent the inevitable heartbreak. \n\nWe text everyday and often run errands together. We click together so well and our conversations seem effortless, It's like I've known her for years. She stays at my place every Saturday for drinks. Last night we had the best sex we ever had and afterwards, she said she loves me. Needless to say I was taken aback because this was what I was trying to prevent and she said it first. I froze up and just smiled back. \n\nI feel bad because I really like her and I want to love her but it hasn't got to that point. We're still getting to know eachother. Im pretty sure I will fall really hard for her with time if I don't learn to control my emotions and act accordingly.\n\nI just got out of a 9 year relationship with someone that is and always has been borderline obsessed me. Now that we're not together she is getting out of hand. Always asking me to come over and  trying feel me up to the point where I feel really uncomfortable and have to leave.\n\nI'm really vulnerable rn and I don't know how to proceed with this new girl. I don't want to break it off with her, ever tbh. She has to go back home in a month and the thought of her leaving really upsets me.\n\nRight now I have two girls who claim to love me but I don't see a future with either of them. I'm not attracted to my ex and my FWB is quite frankly out of my league. Not even sure what she doing with me.\n\nShould I break it off now or just enjoy the short time we have together? \nShould I tell my ex about this person to make her understand that it's really over?\n\nTL;DR: my fwb said she loves me\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "I’m (25f) FWB with this guy (27m) for a little over a month. I’ve known him for about a year and a half. He’s my friend’s brother who I met through her. I was instantly attracted to him the night we met and I know he was into me. But about two years ago his fiancé admitted she was cheating on him and left him for the other guy. So he’s really nervous about getting into a relationship.\n\nHe and I finally hooked up like I said like a month ago and we’ve hooked up five times since. It’s great. The sex is great. I have absolutely no complaints about that at all.\n\nBut I feel like I really just want more with him. And sometimes I think he wants us to be more too. He’ll send me random texts sometimes about how he thinks I’m beautiful. He’s really attentive, he makes me laugh. He’s really thoughtful. For instance he called me on Friday and asked if he could take me to the art museum because he saw an artist I like has an exhibition there. Now, he’s not into art. And I think I may have mentioned this artist once to him in passing. But he remembered and is going to take me to see the exhibition on Tuesday. Like, I know afterwards we’ll probably go back to his place and hook up but I don’t get the feeling that’s why he’s doing it. \n\nI enjoy the sex with him. But I feel also that I have so much more to offer to him. I think we could make each other really happy. I just want him to give it a chance. I know he got hurt. But that was someone else that did it. I want to tell him all of this. I want him to know how great I think he is. \n\nI want to tell him Tuesday. If he feels differently I know it may change things and maybe he’ll say we can’t be FWB anymore. But maybe he’ll say he feels the same?  Should I just tell him? I’ve never really been in a situation like this before and I’m hoping someone else out there who has will have some advice for me.\n\nTL;DR: I want to tell my FWB that I want us to be more.

      "content": "TLDR: GF (27F) and I (25M) agreed it was best for us to break up, and now I feel it was a huge mistake. I hurt her feelings really badly and it completely changed the dynamic of our relationship. I want her back so badly.\n\nSo my ex-gf and I got into a relationship last year April pretty much straight after Valentine’s Day - cliche I know. As you’d expect the honeymoon stage was great, loads of sex, plenty of late night laughs, I’m sure you guys know how it goes.\n\nA couple months down the line we plan our first holiday together to go island hopping in Greece. We were both aware that not only did we have different personalities, we also just saw life differently and handled it in different ways e.g. one was more organised, the other was more go with the flow etc.\n\nThis first holiday of ours turned out to be a nightmare for the most part, we couldn’t seem to agree on anything, arguing all the time due to a lack of organisation etc. Somehow towards the end of the one week we manage to make peace and it’s all good from there. When we come back home to London, things became so much better - I think we realised that that was our first big hurdle that we managed to get through. I remember taking her hand and saying “this is not what’s going to make or break us”. She trusted me, we flipped the script and made it work.\n\nFast forward a couple months to October and this is where everything goes downhill. We were both at my place and for the whatever reason we start talking about America - somewhere that’s always been a dream of mine to live in. We were high off weed and she asks me: “If you had a really good job opportunity to live there, would you leave me and go?” - without any hesitation I say yes. Now why did I do that you ask? Because it felt like the honest thing to say at the time.\n\nBetween the months of October and April, things just aren’t easy as you’d expect them not to be. The relationship seems to slowly be fizzling out and we’re both trying our best but nothing seems to be working. Towards the end of April she calls it - “I think we should break up.” and I don’t even try and negotiate, I simply agree and think that it’s for the best considering we don’t seem compatible for the future because of things such as where to settle down, when to raise a family etc.\n\nFast forward a month and obviously we’re still broken up. Do I regret? Oh boy do I regret it. Why did I just accept the end of the relationship? I wouldn’t say we gave up on it because we were working on it for months.\n\nHowever, now it seems my eyes have finally opened up. I feel like I’ve given up on something that I knew I had, which made me happy, for something that isn’t even set in stone and may never even happen. I called her a couple days ago and said I want her back. I said I had time to reflect and how I know what she needs from me in the relationship and that I’m willing to give it to her alongside finding some sort of compromise as that’s what relationships are all about - she said it was a lot to take in and she’ll need a couple days to think about what I said.\n\nI don’t know what to do - I just know I don’t want to live in regret and see her as the one who got away.\n\nWe both still have love for each other and I’m definitely still in love with her. How do I win her back? I feel like this is my final shot.",

      "title": "Blindsided by my (29F) boyfriend's (29M) critique of my cleanliness. Need help/advice",
      "content": "Hi there! My (29F) boyfriend (29M) have been together for about 2 years. We moved in together 6 months ago (into the house that my boyfriend owns) and I thought things were going relatively well. We don't tend to have any real communication snags, which now makes perfect sense. Apparently my boyfriend has been bottling up his frustration/resentment about the cleanliness of the house and decided to unleash all of it on me today.\n\nAdditional background: my boyfriend I'm being honest, is a bit of a slob. I knew this about him when I met him and it didn't bother me because many, many people close to me in my family and otherwise are also slobs. Running around like a little gremlin and cleaning the occasional tornados people leave behind is truly just part of being in a functional household to me. Nothing ever gets too messy, and if it does, you all pitch in and clean it together. I would consider myself a relatively organized/routine person, but very laid back. As you can imagine, I had multiple conversations with my boyfriend about our cleaning styles and our expectations for living together so we wouldn't have the very issue we're having now.\n\nThe house is MUCH cleaner than it was when my boyfriend was living here by himself but, according to him, I'm not doing enough. He spent over an hour telling me about all of the little things I'm not doing correctly (i.e. sometimes I'll forget to move an empty soda can into the recycling bin before I go to sleep for the night, or I'll do all the dishes and forget to clean the pot that's on the stove) and how it frustrates him and stresses him.\n\nI told him I can be more mindful, but the truth is that all of these things he was so upset with me about were minor mistakes/slip ups that people just make from time to time. (I clean every day, and any room we use on a regular basis is maintained on a schedule that I keep). His accusations also seemed kind of hypocritical because he does almost no cleaning. Like borderline zero. I told him he can pitch in and help, to which he said he does and that's why he's so frustrated and exhausted. (Reddit, I'm not crazy. I know there can be a misperception of what you're doing vs. what someone else is doing to keep things clean, but I am 100% confident that I am doing 90% of the cleaning -- which I don't mind! I agreed to do a lot of cleaning because I enjoy it more!)\n\nThe other issue is that there are projects that my boyfriend will start up and not finish and I guess he's been expecting me to clean those as well? (He did not communicate this to me until now, and I guess maybe it's on me for not asking, but I try to respect his space by not messing with the projects he has going).\n\nAnyway, I'm on Reddit because my boyfriend is genuinely fuming about this. I think this is honestly the most angry I've ever seen him. But I don't understand what to do. I don't want to be walking around on eggshells, worrying about every little thing, when that's not how he treats the house at all. Yeah, sure, it gets a little messy over the course of the day (can you take a guess why), but then it just...gets cleaned. I know he has ADHD, and that also makes organization and cleanliness tough, but this situation just seems really unfair to me. I really do keep the place tidy and clean up after myself, but things are constantly accumulating throughout the day.\n\nIs there anything that I've written that points to an issue/attitude/communication problem I have that needs to be adjusted? How can I create a working system where we both live and clean comfortably in a way that leaves both of us feeling happy? It's almost like my boyfriend has decided he wants everything perfectly organized but isn't willing to put in the work to make it that way. I love our house, and I love being here with him, and I'm just heartbroken to learn he's been so secretly unhappy all these months.\n\nTLDR: My (29F) boyfriend (29M) is totally ticked about our home's cleanliness and I don't know what to do. I say 'blindsided' in my title because he has not mentioned anything like this until now. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone! So, I (F21) have been dating my boyfriend (M21) for about six months now. We're having a good relationship overall, but there's something that really bothers me.\n\nI’ve asked and encouraged him to do activities that I’m really interested in so we can spend more time together and I can share my hobbies with him. These activities include things like running, biking, walking, and artsy stuff. He’s more of a gym guy and plays chess—things I was somewhat into when we started dating (I was working out a bit and just starting my chess journey, lol).\n\nWhen we began dating, it felt natural for me to get into his hobbies and participate in them to spend time with him. But when I tried to get him into mine, he always seemed to have an excuse. In the past six months, he’s gone running with me only once—even though I trained with him about three times a week.\n\nA month ago, I was practically begging him to go outside for a walk with me on the weekend so we could get some fresh air. He said he was too busy and didn’t feel like it. Later that same week, he texted me to say he was going on a walk—with his brother (M22). Honestly, I felt hurt and a bit betrayed. I let it slide, but nothing changed. He kept going on walks with his brother, but not with me, even when we were spending weekends together. Eventually, I told him I was frustrated. I explained that I was making an effort to be involved in his interests, but it didn’t feel mutual. I think he understood.\n\nThen, this weekend, I finally convinced him to come running with me—but he got sick, so we didn’t go. I went home, and later he told me he ended up going on a run with his brother anyway—and that he had a better running time than I’ve had lately.\n\nI know it’s not a competition, but I couldn’t help feeling a bit butthurt. Running is something I really enjoy, and now he’s not only doing it without me, but he's also outperforming me at it. It’s silly, but sometimes it's nice to feel like you’re better at something than your partner, and vice versa. Now I’m left wondering—what do I even have that’s mine in this relationship?\n\nBut more than that, it’s the fact that he keeps choosing to do these things with his brother, but not with me. I feel jealous and mad, and I know it might seem irrational, but… is it? Is this kind of behavior normal? And is it normal to feel jealous about this sort of thing?\n\nAnyway, thanks for reading, haha!\n\nTL;DR : I've been dating my boyfriend, Jay, for six months, and while our relationship is generally good, I'm frustrated that he won't engage in my hobbies (like running or walking) even though I've made an effort to join in his (like gym workouts and chess). He often makes excuses to avoid doing things I enjoy, yet does those same activities—like walking or running—with his brother instead. This makes me feel hurt, jealous, and unappreciated. I’ve brought it up, and he seemed to understand, but nothing has changed. I'm struggling with whether my feelings are valid and if this behavior is normal in a relationship.  \n",

His mum also made a hurtful comment. I want to go back to feeling confident and independent\n\nmy bf and i have known eachother/going on dates since 29 september 2024. we became official in january 2025. we met on hinge. he’s always been so obsessed and in love with me sometimes saying i can’t believe your my gf sometimes. at the start till about a few weeks ago i was so secure and in love with him but not as affectionate as he was i still loved my alone time he wanted to see me more than i did in my head etc. now i feel so insecure all of a sudden i feel like im not good enough and ive been so anxious and i always want him around and want to cuddle and im scared hes wanting to leave me. today he said he felt a bit like we were walking in eggshells around me cos i get sensitive and keep asking whether he loves me. wha am i doing how do i go back to not needing him this much and being independent and not being afraid he doesn’t love me or will cheat etc \n\na few things that have affected this is i went through his phone and saw that he was messaging a lot of blonde aesthetic girls (beach carefree bikini type feed) before me. (big mistake by me). his ex came up on my depop when i was searching for a dress and she’s got an amazing body that’s better than mine and i keep thinking how he’s slept with her and probably comparing my body to hers. he also said to me i like that you’re not super skinny. but im a size 6 au and people have always called me skinny and he kept saying not but being skinny is not good you’re a healthy weight which is what i love. and then i was comparing my body to his ex in my head because she is model thin. \n\nfurther to this, a few weeks ago his mum got drunk and questioned whether i fit in well to the family culturally and made comments to exclude meat a family trip. my boyfriend fully took my side in this, set his mum straight/said he won’t tolerate comments like that and she apologised to me (sincerely). but that also made me feel so shit about myself like i’m not good enough. \n\nhow to shift the dynamic back to when i wasn’t insecure, clingy, requiring his affection and constant reassurance etc? this whole week ive kept asking him whether he loves me and if im even his type. he knows i went through his phone and saw the blonde girls and he said he keeps saying im his type and he loves me and he shows this in other ways also. i hate myself right now for being like this so please be nice.

      "title": "Does this relationship still have a future, or am I holding myself back?",
      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m in a situation that’s been weighing heavily on me lately, and I’d really appreciate some outside perspective. I’m 20 years old and have been in a relationship for a year now. It’s my girlfriend’s second relationship, and it’s my first. We’re the same age. There are definitely great aspects to our relationship, and I do see potential — but there are also serious issues that leave me stuck between my future and this relationship.\n\nWhen we first got together, I used to hit the gym 4–5 times a week, especially during weekend nights with friends — it was an important part of my lifestyle. Since we became a couple, we’ve been spending almost every weekend together from Friday evening to Sunday night, and also a few evenings during the week. While I do enjoy our time together, we mostly just hang out, watch Netflix, go for walks — not really anything productive. The problem is, I also study, have to work, and I have a business project with a friend, and I want to keep up with the gym and start Muay Thai — I have goals I want to pursue while I’m young and have time.\n\nWhen I try to talk to her about needing more time for myself and my goals, she takes it personally. She interprets it as me not loving her enough, not making her a priority, or wanting to see her less. She says she also has to study and work but still makes time for me, so I should be able to do the same. She has very high expectations of emotional presence — like wanting her partner to only have eyes for her and treat other women very distantly.\n\nI want to emphasize that I’ve tried to communicate this with her — multiple times. I’ve explained that I need time for myself, not just for work or productivity, but because I function better when I have space to recharge and focus on what matters to me. Alone time is important for my well-being, but every time I try to express this, it ends in her feeling hurt or rejected. She takes it as a sign that I don’t care about her enough, rather than understanding that this is something I genuinely need. So while some people might say “just talk it through and find a compromise,” I feel like I’ve already done that — and it hasn’t worked. She sees my needs as a threat rather than something we could balance together.\n\nThere’s also a deep trust issue. Her last boyfriend betrayed her trust (flirting with other girls, keeping nudes, etc.), and I’ve made mistakes too. Most recently, she found that I had viewed some stupid thirst trap content on TikTok — nothing I saved or interacted with, just watched. But it triggered a big fight, and I fully understand why. I apologized, deleted TikTok, and acknowledged it as a moment of weakness and lack of dicipline I'm working on. But it really hurt her and worsened the trust issues that were already there.\n\nShe also gets upset over things that seem harmless to me. For example, one time I bought flowers for my mother’s birthday, and before heading into the gym, I asked a female staff member at the gym front desk (she was the only person there) if she could hold them for me during my workout, since they’d get damaged in my locker. My girlfriend was with me at the time, and afterwards, she was really upset — saying I was too nice to the staff member and that a “real man” shouldn’t speak so kindly to other women. From my perspective, it was just a practical and polite interaction — nothing more.\n\nI’m not even saying I need to be friends with other girls — that’s not what I’m after. I don’t feel the need for female friends. But at the very least, just being able to communicate normally, socialize, and maybe build connections if there is any value or so like a normal person — simply because it’s always valuable to know people and improve your social skills — is already a huge issue for her. In her eyes, like I mentioned, a man shouldn’t even be kind to another woman. To her, things like simply talking to other women or being friendly already feel like a form of cheating — because in her eyes, a truly loyal man only has eyes for her, ignores other girls completely, and would never initiate any kind of interaction with them, as that would already cross a boundary of trust.\n\nShe often questions whether I’m really out with my friends and asks me to send proof. It’s exhausting. And while I’ve made my mistakes and try to take accountability, the trust issues have been there from the start and seem to be growing, not healing.\n\nRight now, I feel stuck between two paths. Part of me wants to hold on and try to fix things. But the other part wonders if I’m already giving up too much of myself just to maintain this relationship — and whether that’s something I’ll regret later. I’m trying to figure out what’s truly right for me long-term.\n\nTL;DR:\nI’m 20 and in a one-year relationship with someone I care about, but I’m stuck between growing as a person and keeping the relationship going. I’ve already communicated that I need time and space to focus on studying, the gym, and building a self-employment project — but my girlfriend takes that as rejection. Trust issues, emotional pressure, and control are wearing me down. I’m unsure whether to keep pushing or choose myself.\n",

      "title": "I (27F) self-sabotaged my relationship with my boyfriend (30M) due to depression and imposter syndrome. Is it too late to fix it?",
      "content": "\nHello everyone, I’m asking for kindness and non-judgmental advice and opinions as I’m going through a very difficult time in my life. I feel burnt out with life and I (27F) have self-sabotaged my first-ever loving relationship with my boyfriend (30M). For backstory, we met and dated during the pandemic. I was a non-traditional community college student about to transfer and he was a military sergeant who was thinking of pursuing college for the first time in order to become an officer. We fell in love and with some encouragement he applied to community college and I transferred. We lived 10 min from each other for a year and then 30 min from each other for 2 years. Although there are many precious memories, our arguments have reached a limit to him and I’m afraid there’s no turning back as much as I’m trying to fix it.\n\nI think it all started when it was his turn to transfer and he was applying to a local university. I saw the potential in him and encouraged him to apply to the local private university that is known as one of the best in the country. He was hesitant yet he applied 2 weeks prior to the deadline. When he got accepted to the private university, I cried tears of joy. I was so very proud of him! However, I didn’t expect him to be loaded in work. Now he had military officer training (rotc), 20 units per quarter in order to graduate within 2 years, and tons of reading and essays. Meanwhile, I was finishing my last year of public university with school-related stress and severe imposter syndrome because I had tried for 3 years to obtain a major-related internship and failed.\n\nAfter I graduated in May 2024, my imposter syndrome got worse because I obtained a seasonal position I didn’t really want. Then, I was coming to a realization that my boyfriend’s college career was working out so well for him. This is when I first started feeling a bit jealous of my boyfriend. In the past year, he got accepted as an officer which means that will be his title/ranking in the military once he’s active after his graduation. This meant a year away from home to train and I was ok with that. I started planning out goals to achieve during our year away from each other so when I move in with him, I can be financially and mentally independent. But nothing in my life has worked out how I wanted it to.\n\n• I moved back in with my parents which meant we were 2 hrs away from each other.\n\n• I only worked for 2 months as a seasonal employee. My job search has led to a few interviews. I’ve been forced to accept job rejections and ghosting. I have tailored my resume multiple times with chatgpt and wrote cover letters for the positions I was really interested in. \n\n• A month ago, my 15 yo childhood dog started suffering epilepsy and had to be put down. Seeing my dog have a 10 min seizure was extremely traumatic. \n\n• 2 months ago, my homeless uncle, aunt, and aunt’s husband moved into our home. A family of 4 is now 7 in a 3 bed/2 bath home. We’re all adults and I gave up my room so my aunt and her husband could sleep in it. To say I’m overwhelmed is an understatement. I have no privacy and my aunt is a highly opinionated woman and having to hear her voice everyday annoys me because I disagree with lots of things she says yet I have to remain composed and apathetic because I don’t want to make her feel disrespected.\n\nI’ve only hung out with my boyfriend for 2-3 weekends this year and the last 2 weekends were messy and unhealthy that I don’t really remember most of the arguments. The first weekend I recall feeling sad because he was not giving me enough attention but that was the norm because he was always busy with school. What triggered me was seeing a matching bracelet I gave him. I had mine on but his was on a shelf and that killed me emotionally. I didn’t say anything and went into his apartment bathroom to cry on the floor. After an hour of crying, I kept thinking to myself “Why isn’t he coming for me? Why am I torturing myself?”. I had enough and went into the small living room and cried. I was still ignored for hours. After about 3 hours of just crying on the floor, I started hitting myself and saying things like “you don’t love me”. I ripped the matching bracelet off of me. He obviously reacted but didn’t hug me. He told me to relax and we talked while I cried and then I told him to hug me. He told me to play a game on my iPad and then we went to bed cuddling and had sex. The next day it was as if nothing had happened.\n\nThe second weekend we hung out, I didn’t feel like cooking with him which is usually what we do. I felt tired of my life and was only thinking of jobs and career future. I do remember opening up about being so worried that my plans weren’t working out and how traumatic this job search has been. I felt like not owning a car and having all my savings decrease overtime made me feel like a worthless girlfriend. What do I have to offer when we move in together? The next day, I don’t remember what he said but I started packing up my stuff crying. I told him I wasn’t feeling good and that it would be best if I leave. We then sat down and he started getting a bit upset that in the past 2 years I always run away during an argument or over something he says. He had told me he was walking on egg shells and I told him the same. I was running away but letting him know for the first time ever which was kind of hard to do. Looking back, it’s a bit of growth to even be a bit open in communication instead of being silently dramatic when running away. I didn’t leave and the next day we went on a beautiful hike and had lunch. This was 5 weeks ago. \n\nComing back home, I realized that I’m not ok. I felt on the verge of burnout. My self-esteem was at its lowest and I couldn’t recognize myself anymore. Nothing brings me joy. I decided to seek therapy because I was done feeling overwhelmed with life. I was jealous of my boyfriend’s life and tired of not being able to regulate my emotions. I knew this was depression. Eventually, I broke down at home because I was rejected from the 2 positions I had interviewed at. I wasted an entire month just interviewing with those companies and carrying false hope. Breaking down for me is ugly. So much self-loathing sentiments and the urge to simply die but being unable to. A huge wave of negative thoughts I’ve been telling myself about everything including my relationship overtook me and I blew it later that night (Mother’s Day weekend). He FaceTimes me and in the recent months, our conversations have been about his upcoming graduation. With attitude, I let him know that it’s best if he gives away my graduation ticket to someone else in his family because they will enjoy and celebrate him more than I ever will. He asked “What did you say?” And I said “You know what I said”. He sternly smiled and said ok. We hung up and I went to sleep with deep shame. I had my first therapy session the next day and the connection wasn’t there which was frustrating. I realized I regretted hurting my boyfriend and that what I truly needed was a psychiatrist. I meet her this Wednesday. Anyways, my boyfriend still texted me and I kindly said I wasn’t feeling well and that I would text him another day. He told me that was ok and to feel better. It took me 4 days to calm down and during those 4 days I finally opened up to my mom about what was going on with me. I cried because I had negative 10 dollars in my bank account all because my ego didn’t allow me to work a regular retail/fast food job. I felt a bit better once I made my psych appointment because I wanted to change for the better. I’m tired of hurting the people that love me the most. After 4 days, I texted him what was up and he ignored me. After a few messages he tells me he had the roughest weekend ever, that I wouldn’t understand and wants to be alone and just focus on finishing strong in order to graduate. I said I was here now and to talk to me and he refused. I called him 8 times until he picked up with attitude. I told him this is clearly a relationship issue and it’s an urgent matter that needs to be fixed. He basically said he doesn’t want to be with me anymore. I cause a lot of stress and pain for him and the resentment had been building up overtime which led him not trusting me anymore. I knew all of our problems that I instigated were part of his decision but clearly the graduation ticket comment was the breaking point. I cried so much and had another mental breakdown. I opened up to my mom about all the times I’ve been so mean and spiteful to him and how he didn’t deserve any of it. \n\nAfter a few days he accepted a phone call where I apologized and let him know I was already trying to seek help and I wanted him to give us another chance. He said no as it didn’t matter anymore since he’s leaving for a year. I cried again for almost a week and I felt I was going crazy. The psych ward couldn’t have me as I didn’t have plans to you know what. I was referred to a crisis counselor that didn’t help at all.\n\nI then chose to drive to him since I hadn’t seen him in 5 weeks. I left a care package of food and snacks that I paid with a credit card. He kindly accepted it and took me for a walk to talk. We catched up as if nothing had ever happened. Then we started talking about the care package. He said he felt so bad that I wasn’t coping well and had driven 2 hrs to see him. He wanted to give me money and I refused. He told me “you know you’re struggling”. That hurt me to the max and I apologized again about the graduation comments and anything I ever said or did. He said the resentment was there but that all was forgiven. He said he couldn’t take me back if I didn’t love myself. He said “How can you love someone else if you don’t love yourself?”. He had watery eyes throughout our conversation but I just ugly cried. I told him I was already making a huge step to fixing myself and he said no. He said he asked many times for me to change and he never saw it. He doesn’t believe I will change and my heart shattered. I had self-sabotaged my relationship. We hugged one last time and he didn’t want to kiss me so I don’t get false hope of reconciliation. \n\nI don’t know how I drove back home but I haven’t eaten in 2 days and my family doesn’t understand me at all. They just want me to accept and feel better. I have to hear them talk about how disrespectful I am that I’m not eating or doing anything. I’m officially burnt out and want my own space to mourn. I keep beating myself up even though he told me not to. He told me he cares a lot about me and still loves me and I lowkey feel betrayed because he has never left before when I’m out of my mind. His graduation week includes officer training graduation, his birthday, and our 4 year anniversary as well. All hopes and dreams are lost because of me and I truly regret hurting him. Why couldn’t I support him when he loved me? Does anyone have stories about reconciliation? Any advice? Thank you for reading. I’m lost and I’m very sorry this is all about me. I hope to be better.   \n\n\nTL;DR: I’ve been deeply depressed and overwhelmed with life. I pushed away the person I love the most and now he says he can’t be with me anymore. He still cares, but says I need to focus and love myself first. I’ll be seeing a psychiatrist soon but he says he doesn’t want to pursue the relationship anymore. Is there any hope for reconciliation? How do I move forward when I feel like I destroyed everything?\n\n",

I love my girlfriend of 4 years, and while we have our ups and downs, I plan to be with her long term. I am very close with my family though, and it feels like a lot of the interactions between the two are strained and awkward, tbh often at the hand of my gf. I don’t blame her, my family can be difficult to read and especially for someone who is likely on the spectrum, (very high functioning), who is socially awkward, my family would be difficult to navigate. My dad has told me a few years ago that he doesn’t think she’s the ‘right fit’ for the family, which was really hard to hear and he has told me that he regrets saying it. Regardless, I still feel like there is a lack of chemistry and I’ve tried helping from both sides. Is a relationship doomed to fail if they can’t mesh well? I love them both very much and don’t want to have to have distance between the two.\n\nTLDR: my girlfriend doesn’t have great chemistry with my family but I love them both and don’t know how to navigate the situation.",

Thousands of tickets on Fifa’s official ticket partner Ticketmaster are now being priced as low as $55.75 (£41) — 16 per cent of the original asking price of $349 (£257).\n\nFifa had hoped Messi’s involvement would draw a full crowd to the 65,000-capacity Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, but have had to face the harsh reality that its new 32-team global club tournament has failed to spark the interest the world governing body had hoped.",

Goretza fires through a defender's legs but the pass was behind him so he doesn't really get any power on it. Easy save for Costa.\n\n7': SAVE! Ronaldo with a chance but he scuffs it a tiny bit and ter Stegen is down in time to stop it.\n\n11': Neto gets a step past the defense on the left side and fires from an angle and puts it high.\n\n19': SAVE! Pavlović goes down in the box, did Inácio foul him?? While everyone else is standing around waiting for the call, Woltemade fires the ball but Costa dives to keep it out!! No penalty btw\n\n21': FANTASTIC SAVE! Goretzka fires a shot towards the bottom corner, Costa sees it late but is quick enough to get it away for a corner!\n\n43': Wirtz fires through traffic from distance but it's right at Costa.\n\n44': Neves gets whistled for a foul even though on replay it wasn't his fault, Middelstadt was actually hit in the face by the ball, not Neves, call gets overturned\n\n**HT Germany 0-0 Portugal** Spirited but no goals yet.\n\n-----\n\n46': We're back!\n\n47': A giveaway by Germany, a cross from Nendes to Ronaldo, Ronaldo stretches for it but puts it wide!\n\n48': [](#icon-ball-big) **GOAL GERMANY!! A beautiful delicate chip from Kimmich to *Florian Wirtz* who heads it perfectly past Costa into the far side!**\n\n51': [](#icon-yellow) The Portuguese bench has been clamoring for a foul to disallow the goal, the ref checks the screen and upholds the goal, then gives on the Portuguese assistants a yellow for their reaction to the call\n\n52': [](#icon-yellow) *Rúben Neves* gets whistled for a foul and gets a card and *Robert Martínez* complains enough about it to get carded\n\n57': Fernandes's shot deflects just wide! Not given as a corner!\n\n58': [](#icon-sub) Portugal triple sub: *Nélson Semedo, Francisco Conceição and Vitinha* on for *João Neves, Francisco Trincão and Rúben Neves*\n\n60': Portugal with the corner kick, Ronaldo with the header! But it goes over.\n\n60': [](#icon-sub) Germany triple sub: *Niklas Füllkrug, Robin Gosens and Serge Gnabry* on for *Max Mittelstädt, Leroy Sané and Nick Woltemade*\n\n63': [](#icon-ball-big) **GOAL PORTUGAL!!! *Francisco Conceição* with a beautiful goal!! Perfectly set into the left side! Runs it in all the way from the halfway line and firing from the edge of the box**\n\n68': [](#icon-ball-big) **GOAL PORTUGAL!! Nuno Mendes finds *Cristiano Ronaldo* who taps it in! But was he offside?? VAR says it's good!**\n\n71': [](#icon-sub) Germany double sub: *Karim Adeyemi and Felix Nmecha* on for *Waldemar Anton and Aleksandar Pavlović*\n\n80': [](#icon-yellow) *Jonathan Tah* sweeps out Fernandes's legs to stop the attack\n\n82': Conceição with a big chance! He's all alone up there, he cuts around his defender but he puts it wide of the far post!\n\n83': Big chance for Germany! But Adeyemi hits it into the post!\n\n83': [](#icon-sub) Portugal substitution: *Pedro Neto* on for *Diogo Jota*\n\n84': [](#icon-yellow) Scrap breaks out! *Rúben Dias* and *Florian Wirtz* and *Niclas Füllkrug* all into the book, hard to decode the sequence of events\n\n89': DOUBLE SAVE! Ter Stegen denies Jota and then Conceição!!\n\n90': [](#icon-sub) Portugal substitution: *João Palhinha* on for *Cristiano Ronaldo*\n\n90+5': SAVE! Jota denied by ter Stegen bu there's no more time!\n\n**FT Germany 1-2 Portugal** Portugal is going to the final!",

      "content": "Left out players like Harder, Jackson, Ekitike, Sesko etc because obviously they won't be any cheap. Enjoy :)\n\n\n\n**Troy Parrott (23, AZ Alkmaar)** \n\nTechnically gifted and clever forward with promise demonstrated through loan transfers but marred by injuries and inconsistency. Best used in a supporting role playing off a central striker or as a second striker, where he can utilize clever movement and good vision. Must work on the end product and physicality to become established at the highest level. However, this was his breakout season as he netted 20 times and helped AZ massively. \n\n \n\n**Evann Guessand (23, OGC Nice)** \n\nA physical, dynamic forward who can play as a central striker or out wide, Guessand offers good hold-up play and sufficient link-up. Strong in transition and with good runs into space, he lacks composure in front of goal. He is an asset for the squad because of his versatility but needs a clear development path to enhance his decision-making. Still young with plenty of time to evolve, he registered 23 G/A this season. \n\n**Promise David (23, USG)** \n\nA tall and strong forward that is still raw technically and tactically, but shows flashes of brilliance when given room to run at people. If he can improve on his finishing and coolness under pressure, he can be a top player. Another gem discovered by USG’s amazing scouting network, completed 21 G/A in 31 games. \n\n**Franjo Ivanović (21, USG)**\n\n An agile, intelligent forward with great box awareness, Ivanović combines shrewd movement with good finishing technique. He thrives in confined spaces and has technical skills to tee up play between attack and midfield. Needs to develop more physicality and consistency against better-class sides. He had a great partnership with Promise David and registered 23 G/A \n\n \n\n**Arnaud Kalimuendo (23, Rennes)** \n\nA mobile center-forward with a knack of reading the game and finishing clinically, Kalimuendo has already demonstrated what he is capable of in Ligue 1. Not the most elegant player but very good diagonal runner, good presser, and can finish with both feet. Still developing his all-round game, but has the ingredients to become a proven top-level striker. 22 G/A this season. \n\n**Lucas Stassin (20, AS Saint Etienne)**\n\n Skilled Belgian CF with natural goal-scoring potential, particularly inside the box. Stassin has good positioning and maturity for his age, but lacks physicality however he’s still developing. Needs to bulk up and extend his game outside the penalty area to make the step up. He still had 22 G/A even if he plays for a side that got relegated so definitely the potential is there. \n\n**Matthis Abline (22, Nantes)**\n\n Technically skilled and creative forward, Abline likes cutting inside wide or half-spaces to play. His flair, agility, and ball mastery are assets, but he occasionally becomes too selfish with the ball or overthink things. Needs to improve his decision-making and defensive work to develop into a top-class attacker. 13 G/A for Nantes. \n\n**Ange-Yoan Bonny (21, Parma)**\n\n A hard-working, physical finisher with direct style and physical build, Bonny is ideally suited to closing down system and counter-attacks. He may be nightmare for defenders due to his strength and tenacity but is not quite polished in front of the goal. If he could get better at first touch and finishing, he could quite possibly make a stride into a top team. \n\n**Santiago Castro (20, Bologna)** \n\nA dynamic Argentine striker with plenty of energy, Castro has good off-ball movement, excellent pressing, and a solid work rate. Good technically and with sound game reading, he prefers to make chances through movement. Needs to get more experience in European football but could evolve into a completed modern striker. He registered 18 G/A this season \n\n \n\n**Rômulo (23, Göztepe)**\n\n An energetic Brazilian attacker capable of playing anywhere down the front, Rômulo offers an all-action blend of work rate, technical ability, and tactical acumen. Not a blistering pace, he compensates with guileful movement and intelligent pressing. Still a bit off the beaten path but has tools to become a steady cog in better leagues. He managed 27 G/A this season in Turkey.",

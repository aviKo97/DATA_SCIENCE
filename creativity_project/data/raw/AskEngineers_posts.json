      "content": "Hello engineers! I'm looking to produce thousands of .75\" paper circles for a product, but I haven't been able to find a machine that would allow me to create these in a high-volume. I'm trying to figure out if there's something on the market I haven't considered that could fit my needs, or if I should talk to a engineer to see if getting a machine developed is the better route. I've looked at different types of die cutting machines, but since the majority of consumer models are manual (a lever has to be pulled or a tray has to be rolled through a press) it really puts a strain on the quantity I can produce. Here are the basic parameters of what I'm looking for in the machine:  \n\\- Something that could cut through multiple (15-20) thin sheets of paper (each sheet about 75 microns thick) on one \"cut\"\n\n\\- Machine could cut close to 100 circles or more per \"cut\"\n\n\\- The final circles need to be easy to access (maybe in a bin or catch tray)\n\n\\- Paper could be lined up manually or available on a spool\n\nLaser cutters are not an option for me because I need the paper circles to be perfectly round and unblemished. Is there a semi-automated machine on the market that could produce this, or would it be more beneficial for me to get a machine developed? Thank you in advance for your help!\n\n\\*Edited to add one medium final product would need about 10,000 circles, which is why automation would be preferred.",

      "content": "I have a water tank in the tub of my ute. When the power button is pressed, it turns on the water pump and a solenoid valve that acts as a breather. I had to do this because water sloshed out of the breather all time. The pump and the solenoid share the same fuse. Sometimes, I forget to turn off the switch overnight, to the pump and the solenoid “breaks” and suddenly starts drawing over 10 amps and blows the fuse. Normally its under 2 amps. I have tried putting the solenoid on its own fuse. But then it blows the fuse and I have no breather which breaks the pump. How can I set it in such a way that if I forget to turn the switch off, it automatically cuts the power after couple minutes? I am not very electrical savvy so I am not even sure if its possible. But please give your suggestions.",

I'd like some hard numbers, even if they're just rough estimates.\n\nTo answer, let's give a hypothetical example. We have source of fuel. It's going to power a large city in the desert x km away. Purely from an energy efficiency point of view, what would be the losses if we:\n\n* burn the fuel, generate electricity send it to the city by 400kV AC transmission lines?\n* the fuel is a gas, so we pipe it to the city, burn it, generate electricity?\n* the fuel is a liquid, so we pipe it to the city, burn it, generate electricity?\n\nDoes it make much difference if the \"x km\" is 100km, 1000km, or 10,000km?\n\n(fwiw, the debates are about the green transition, and people who argue against electrification seem to think that electricity transmission has heavy losses... I'd have thought they'd be much lower than piping something around, so that's what I'm curious about)\n\nMake reasonable assumptions and state them, or ask me questions if it's not clear (hopefully I've been clear enough).\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nEDIT: the best answers so far were by Freecraghack, ignorantwanderer and jedienginenerd - thanks!",

      "content": "I've been trying to figure out how I can count loose 9mm rounds. The use case would be ideally grabbing an undefined number of rounds, pouring them into the mechanism's input, which then counts them as it outputs the rounds on the other end.\n\nI have access to a good 3d printer, and would like to create something with as little complexity as possible so it's reliable and has at least decent longevity.\n\nI was thinking of something gravity fed but i have no idea where to start. Cloggin may be an issue if it's just something that funnels, and i'm not sure how to set up a mechanical counter because I think it'd need some sort of lever arm that consistently insertes between the last round to exit and the next one (so it doesn't skip counting). Double counting might also be an issue if this lever is too sensitive or catches in the rim of the rounds.\n\nAn alternative solution I had was just something that can take a bulk input of rounds, make sure they orient with bullet (tip) downward, and funnel down through an output spout by way of gravity. That would let me just direct it basically like a hose, into a common 9mm round tray that holds 50, then i can rinse repeat for lower complexity counting. \n\nThe only thing i've really seen through searching online is the Dillon reloading machines that have a bullet re-orienting mechanism but it operates very slowly, and i'd rather do something as simple as possible. See here: https://youtu.be/5sxDBH3BGsE?t=32\n\nI also found this type of gravity feed design but it seems unreliable and prone to clogging. https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanical_gifs/comments/1bz3pvg/always_correct_orientation/\n\nAnyone have any ideas of where to start?",

The goal is to streamline the process by enabling one pump to handle all compartments effectively.\n\n\nAdditionally, the solution must be lightweight to ensure it does not adversely affect the plane's performance.",

There is a chain/anchor line mount centered in the framing on the underside. I want to anchor the line as straight down as possible to significantly reduce any risk of accidental diving into the anchor line.\n\nSince a traditional anchor and line gets its ability to hold a much heavier object in place via a long anchor line that pulls the anchor into the floor at an angle, I'm concerned about solving for the right anchor weight or method, e.g. if I need to use a screw-in type of stake installed by a diver. Some info below:\n\n* Approximate weight on land of dock is 2,000 lbs\n* depth of area to set anchor is approximately 30'.\n* The lake experiences a change in resting water level over the year of +/- 1', and the wind can stir waves of up to a foot, so I plan to leave anchor line a couple feet longer than surface to floor to account for height changes, yet still keep the possible angle of the line as straight up and down as possible for diving safety.\n\nHow do I solve for anchor weight required given the above dynamics--really just looking for a safe ballpark number here, fine with going heavier.\n\nThank you!!",

      "content": "Hello Engineers,\n\nI am not an engineer, but I am building a flatbed for my truck. I will never exceed 3k lbs in this 9' bed. I am trying to find the right balance of lightweight, low profile/height, and capacity. Relevant info is that the design is going to be a 3 point torsion free frame that has 2 mounts in the front, and 1 in the back. The deck will be 1.75\" x 9.5\" extruded aluminum decking which seems relevant as this does have some weight carrying capacity on its own.\n\nI am planning on using two lengths of steel 4\" C-channel running the length of the bed, parallel to the frame rails. My question: Is it better to stack steel 3\" C-channel on top of and perpendicular to the 4\" channel, allowing the 3\" channel crossmembers to be full width (we will call this option 1)? Or is it better to weld 4\" channel perpendicular to the continuous rails to form the crossmembers (we will call this option 2)?\n\nThe second option would have no continuous cross members, but they would be 4\" and save me 3\" of height.\n\nTIA\n\nEDIT: Potentially worth mentioning is that if I stack the crossmembers, the decking will run down the length of the truck, if I weld the crossmembers in between the two \"frame rails\" then the decking will run across the truck.  \nAlso, the \"stacked\" crossmembers will still be welded where they sit on the frame rails.\n\nExample of option 1: [https://www.tractorbynet.com/forums/attachments/1488846424127-jpg.501114/](https://www.tractorbynet.com/forums/attachments/1488846424127-jpg.501114/)\n\nExample of option 2, though this appears to be using tube and not channel: [https://rvglobetrekker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Expedition-Garage-bed-platform-7.webp](https://rvglobetrekker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Expedition-Garage-bed-platform-7.webp)",

My design, not tested, will give me around 24PPR.   \n   \nHowever, I realized that I had essentially zero experience in determining the shaft design, or really, how to attach my wheel to the encoder in an extremely stable and secure manner to ensure precise readings of pulses from my encoder.   \n  \nMy background is in computer science and electrical engineering (and so I have experience in rigid body statics, dynamics). I have decided to go through Jeff Hansons mechanics of materials playlist on youtube (along with problems in the textbook), and then go through chapters 5-8 of Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design textbook.\n\nI think by learning this material I will have a basic understanding of what factors to consider when actually designing the shaft of my system, plus the chassis of the robot.\n\nI would appreciate any advice from experienced engineers who have gone through the material and probably know what knowledge gaps I have that makes me unable to analyze the stress, the rotational stress, vibration and other factors which may cause fractures, or imprecise readings from my encoder (due to poor shaft design, attachments, joints). I do not know if my plan is enough to get me up to scratch. \n\nI am willing to go through quite a bit of learning to get myself to sufficient competency.",

Both ways, so water gets pumped both during the night and day. \n\nThe idea behind this is that since a lot of the work that comes from steam engines is made when water boils and expands into steam. The problem is getting the it from room temperature to 100 celsius. By reducing the pressure, boiling point is lowered, and you no longer need a solar concentrater. \n\nThis might not work because I have a poor understanding of how pressure works. Or it might be simpler to just get a liquid with a lower boiling point as a working fluid. \n\n[1]https://www.skyhookadventure.com/blog/sahara-desert-morocco-weather",

      "content": "it's been a few years since I studied this topic. I am currently having trouble understanding how gears in a car work. Specifically, assume that a stationary car has Y newtons of friction acting against it on a completely flat road. To get the car moving, you need to provide a force that is larger than Y. The 1st gear of a car does this by creating more than Y newtons of force in the desired direction while the engine is at a standard rpm of 1500 for instance.\n\nMy problem is, when the car is moving, the friction force acting on it ( Y) stays the same or even increases (at least thats what I assume). Regardless of the car's motion, there is therefore still a force of at least -Y Newtons acting on the car.\n\nHigher gears such as 6th gear will produce less forward force than the first gear at the same rpm (e.g. 6th gear will only produce 0.2Y at engine rpm of 1500). Otherwise it would be possible to start the car in 6th gear at low rpms, which is evidently not possible.\n\nMy understanding is that to keep the car moving at a constant speed or to accelerate it, you have to apply a force equal to or greater than Y to overcome the deceleration due to friction. If 6th gear can only provide 0.2Y newtons of force at 1500 rpm, then how does this gear still seemingly accelerate the car at this rpm despite still having -0.8Y newtons of force slowing the car?\n\nI understand that engines have an optimal rpm range and that tyre rpm is different from engine rpm. However both gears here are placed at the optimum engine rpm of 1500 yet this still doesn’t seem to work. At 1500 engine rpm, how does 6th gear overcome friction when the car is moving but cannot overcome the same friction when the car is stationary. \n\nSorry if this problem is very trivial, but I just can't seem to recall anything that will solve my problem.",

      "content": "Hey r/AskEngineers,\n\nI’m part of my university rocket club, and we’re building a strength database for fiberglass composites. Our goal is to figure out how many layers we need in a rocket body tube and fins to meet certain strength and weight requirements.\n\nThe issue we’re running into is that standardized tests (like ASTM D256 “impact strength” or D790 “flexural strength”or D638  “tensile strength” or D695 “cylinder compression strength”) require minimum specimen sizes. But for example a single cured layer of fiberglass is often too thin to meet those dimensional requirements, making it hard to directly measure its properties.\n\nOur questions:\n\nHow do professional labs or teams test extremely thin fiberglass layers that don’t meet ASTM thickness requirements?\n\nIs it valid to test multi-layer specimens and extrapolate back to a per-layer strength?\n\nAre there modified or alternative test setups that could still give us useful strength data for thin layups?\n\nWould adding a backing or sandwiching the thin layer between more rigid materials (known strength) for testing be an accepted workaround?\n\nWe’re trying to approach this as close to industry standards as possible, but we’re also open to practical solutions used in the field or in R&D settings. Any advice from engineers or materials scientists would be really appreciated!\n\nThanks!\n\n",

Once the check closes, it seals well.  It's a swing check.\n\nIs there some design specification we're overlooking?  The intermittent issue leads me to believe we're somehow operating on the edge of some design condition and minor changes in the distribution system are causing this valve to work sometimes but not always.  Not a critical application where a backflow preventer is necessary.\n\n",

I get why the flow of electrons depends on the net resistance, it's just like a queue of people, any local electron won't be affected by other resistance, but the one next to it will be affected, and the local electron will be affected by the one next to it, so it make chain of effect and cause, literally a flow.\n\nBut what about voltage?

For garage operators it may also enhance parking capacity by eliminating a downward ramp.\n\nIs that a feasible concept?  Is that a reasonable scale for energy generation?\n\nJust to clarify-this could also be an above ground garage, and in both cases the power generation would only happen when cars are descending.  All the up-ramp driving would still be done under the car's own power.",

      "content": "So after looking into Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) for a while I’ve been wondering why sterling engines aren’t as “popular” as in common knowledge or commercially developed to be much cheaper by economies of scale; especially seeing how old they actually are and the many perks they have. \nMy line of thought is obviously coupling the heat from CSP to a thermal energy storage (another one thats also not so “popular” but that could be for another post) and then to a sterling engine to produce electricity on demand. In such a way that can somewhat compete with diesel powered gens or Solar PV + batteries and can be supplied according to scale ( the current CSP projects are mostly large scale). \nNot an expert or practitioner of this field of any sort it just interests me so would love any insights or knowledge. \nThank You in Advance ",

In a Formula car loosing the right side of your front wing will reduce your maximum cornering speed in left hand corners more than right handers (correct me if I am wrong). \n\nBut if youre thinking about load distribution in high speed corners the outside tire is already experiencing incredible forces pushing it into the ground therefore the thought was to support the inside tire to balance the loads. \n\nNow would you want more downforce on the left or right side at Monza because the Lesmos and Parabolica are all fast right-hand corners?",

      "content": "The de Havilland Mosquito was a highly effective British bomber in WW2 that had a unique design philosophy. Instead of being loaded with guns, ammo, and people to shoot them, all of which took up valuable weight, it was instead given extra bombs to fulfill its job of delivering warheads to foreheads. \n\nThe Mosquito's most standout characteristic however is that it was made out of wood, instead of metal. This allowed the plane to shred more weight, making it the fastest warplane in the world for awhile, with a top speed of 425 mph, as well as the wood frame reducing its vulnerability to RADAR of the time, making it semi-stealth. \n\nOne mission type the Mosquito would perform is to perform long range reconnaissance by removing the bombs and replacing it with extra fuel tanks, which allowed the plane to fly from London to the Soviet Union and back without needing to refuel. For these reasons, the YouTuber \"The Fat Electrician\" dubbed the Mosquito as 'the acoustic SR-71 Blackbird'.\n\nThat got me wondering. Would it be possible to build a wooden plane that can perform at the same level as certain modern platforms? Could you make a wooden SR-71, or B-2, or F-35? Would the plane be capable of performing the same feats as these planes? Or is there some immovable issue that makes this impossible from an engineering perspective?\n\nEdit: Apparently the Mosquito never held the title of fastest aircraft, my mistake.",

      "content": "So I'm not entirely sure how many keys it'll use but it'll be made up of 2 pin keyboard switches and custom key caps. I need it to be able to give an 8 or less bit signal for the IO controller per cycle. My first idea was to have them in an array and scan each key individually, but I don't want it to take up like 40 cycles.\n\nI settled on the idea of putting each key in one of four groups (key type a, key type b, etc). There will be a timer fed a pulse from the crystal oscillator the CPU is using, that counts up two bits (00 to 11) and then reset. On 00 it'll check if a key is pressed in type A, 01 will check type B, etc. This way it'll let you have up to four keys from four different groups pressed, and allows you to use key combos and multiple arrows keys with the rest of the keys at the same time for games and such. If two keys are pressed in the same group, I either want to give one priority somehow or just ground all the lines (all lines low in the output is a blank key, nothing happens.)\n\nThe issue is that I have no idea how to pull this off. Could I just have 8 transistors for each group and tie each bridge to the corresponding high bits for each key?\n\nE.G. attaching the output pin of the F key (code 00000110, with the ones being the high bits) to the second and third transistors. That way if you press F it'll power the second and third transistors, outputting 00000110, the code for F.\n\nWould this work? Is there a better way? How would I prevent jumbled key codes when pressing keys from the same group?\n\nThanks in advance guys, it's really appreciated!!",

      "title": "Pump engineering / physics on reverse-osmosis deep-sea water-farms.",
      "content": "I just noticed something that doesn't make sense to my basic physics principals brain on an \"undecided with Matt Ferrell\" video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu\\_IcFpEkg0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu_IcFpEkg0)\n\nHe's discussing recent advances in osmosis sea-water desalination plants.  Classically, desalination works great but takes too much electricity to run the pumps to push water through the reverse-osmosis filters to make it universally economical.  Basically the claim in the video is that the company he's discussing is placing reverse-osmosis filters at the bottom, 400 meters, 1300 ft, of the sea floor, to take advantage of the water pressure there (about 570 psi).  Makes sense, fine, but then you have to produce a net 570 psi pump-head and provide \"work\" (F\\*x) to pump the water to the surface to use it.  The claim in the vid is that utilizing deep sea pressure takes less energy over-all, but when i do the quick napkin math, the energy required to pump up is the same as that which would be needed to drive pressurized water through a filter on shore.  What am I missing?\n\nMinor caveat: The only additional work being done with an on-shore-pump-through-filter system would be the work required to pressurize the water from 14.7 psi (1 atm) to 570 psi.  Because water is thought of as \"non-compressible\" i would assume the work done here to be negligible.\n\nEDIT:   Another caveat:  There's also the fact that more pressurized saline water must be supplied, like perhaps 8 - 10 times, than the fresh-water produced, as R-O is does not completely desalinate, but just produces a slightly higher salinity waste-brine.   Perhaps the extra work done to pressurize this water is significant enough to demand extra energy, i.e., that this extra 8-10-X makes the incompressibility of water - therefore no work towards pressurization assumption incorrect?  \n\nFYI, in the vid matt points out other ecological benifits to deep-sea R-O having to do with the salinity re-distribution, so perhaps the energy efficiency gain isn't the primary motivation.

      "content": "I have bought an electric scooter for a project, it has a 600w motor, fine on flat ground but doesn't have power for going even a 5% inclination uphill. The motor is a in wheel hub motor, the wheel is alluminium so I can't fit a bigger motor as in spoked wheels. I was wondering if I can increase the voltage to get a bit more umph, the motor needs to last for a few hundred km,  run on short intervals of 3 to 5km . If the motor is for example 36v can I increase voltage with a bigger battery to 60v without something catastrophic happening?\n",

      "content": "My home water supply comes in as 25mm from the street, then reduces to 22mm copper inside the house. The outdoor garden tap is connected via about 1 metre of 15mm pipe before it transitions to a 19mm hose feeding a 1000L IBC tank. From the tank, I use a pump and 50m of 19mm hose to run a large sprinkler.\n\nI'm considering improving flow to the tank for faster fills. My questions are:\n\n1. **How much is the 1m section of 15mm pipe restricting flow compared to using 22mm copper all the way to the tap?** Is it likely to be the bottleneck in this setup?\n2. **If the IBC tank is sealed and used as an in-line buffer tank, would the vacumme formed by the faster out-going water help or hinder the inflow? It will likely collapse under vacuum so perhaps it needs to be vented.**",

How much of a problem would the water surge be since the barrels do not have baffles? I realize it’s like 450lbs of water, I’ve seen it done before but am a bit concerned about it potentially being an issue and curious if anyone has any insight. \n\nIt would be on its side, horizontal to the direction of travel to (hopefully) minimize the effect of the moving water. The bus is on a freightliner chassis and the suspension can easily handle the added weight of the water (I want 2 55 gallon drums) \n\nThe reason I want to use plastic barrels to save money, a used food grade barrel is $20 around me and a commercial 100 gallon tank is easily $350. I have a lot of scrap 1x1 steel tube I can use to weld a frame for it to secure it to the floor. \n\nI am aware they don’t have baffles, it appears rv water storage tanks don’t typically have baffles either.

      "content": "I recently came across a publicly available contract between a FEMA prime contractor (Hagerty Consulting) and the City of Panama City, FL. It lists the billable rate for a Licensed Civil Engineer at $210/hour — not unusual on the surface.\n\nBut here’s the kicker: the same firm is advertising on its website for independent contractor engineers (with active EINs and LLCs) to fill that exact type of role — at $55–$85/hour.\n\nLet that sink in:\nThey're billing local governments (and by extension, FEMA) nearly 3–4x the hourly rate they’re paying subcontractors, many of whom have to cover their own business overhead, travel, and self-employment taxes.\n\nThis feels less like standard overhead and more like opportunistic markup at taxpayer expense, especially in post-disaster recovery work where transparency and trust are crucial.\n\nTo be clear — I’m not knocking primes for covering their admin costs or risk. That’s expected. But when you’re requiring subcontractors to be businesses (EIN, LLC, no benefits), and then paying them W2-level rates, it raises serious questions.\n\nHave others in emergency management, engineering, or public procurement seen similar tactics? Is this common?\nIs there any movement to require more transparency in rate structures for disaster recovery contracts?\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts — especially from those who've been on either side of the FEMA Public Assistance process.",

If anyone is curious, this was for a project for a low-profile desk mounting solution for flight sim gear that I plan on selling on my Etsy shop that wouldn't require any heavy aluminum extrusions or clamps or other bulky/expensive parts. \n\nI recently designed my part around some springs that came in an assortment pack thinking they would be very standardized and cheap. Now every spring website I look at it wants on the high end $10-15 per spring for simple stainless steel closed design, on the lower end $2 each, and best i could find was a shipped from China ebay listing for about $0.60 each shipped direct from china through ebay, which for all I know I will need to pay duties on bringing it up to $2 each anyway.\n\nThis seems insane to me considering the assortment pack was $10 and included 10 of my desired springs, it would be cheaper to order 20 assortment packs and throw out the rest of the springs.

      "content": "I recently got accepted for a job interview for the ability to move up from a quality technician to a quality engineer in charge of first article inspection reviews. This is huge for me as it would be my first actual engineering role I could put on my resume, as well as almost doubling my income with where I'm currently at. I'm worried however I may have overshot my experience with FAI's, as my knowledge mainly comes from shadowing for a week or two the FAI engineer we have at my current company. From my understanding, the interview process/testing will revolve around the Documents 1, 2, and 3, as well as checking we know how to read blueprints (this role is mainly in the aerospace industry, so any blueprints relating to those would be key). I have around 20 days to teach myself as much as I can to prepare myself for this interview, is there a good place to start to prepare myself for this? Is it possible to teach myself all of this in that amount of time? From my understanding on some quick googles the documents are mainly verifying information such as materials, so I assume I'll be spending more time looking into how to properly read the blueprints than I would the rest of it. Any input on a great resource for teaching myself this skill or what would be good to look into would be GREATLY appreciated as this opportunity is huge for me, even if I need to find myself studying for 5 hours a day the next 3 weeks. Thanks in advance for any input!",

      "content": "This was the result of an argument I had with a co-worker. Basically, my co-worker got angry because he was ticketed for going 5 mph over the speed limit. I said, well you were driving over the speed limit, and that's dangerous. So... pay the ticket and move on with your life.\n\nMy co-worker argued that civil engineers know that everybody speeds 5 mph over the speed limit. Therefore, they make the speed limit lower than is \"actually\" dangerous. Therefore, it's actually perfectly safe to drive 5mph over the limit.\n\nHe went on to argue that if anything, engineers probably factor in even more safety margin. They probably know that we all expect 5mph safety factor, and exceed that \"modified limit\" by another 5 mph. And then they assume it's dark and raining, and that's probably the equivalent of 10-15 mph. \n\nI said, that is insane because you end up with some argument that you can drive down a 35 mph street doing 70 and it will be fine. And my co-worker just said that's how engineering works. You have to assume everybody is an idiot, so if you're not an idiot, you have tons of wiggle room that you can play with. \n\nHe went on to say that you take a shelf that's rated for 400 lbs. Well, the engineer is assuming people don't take that seriously. Then they assume that everybody is bad at guessing how much weight is on the shelf. Then you throw in a bit more just in case. So really, your 400 lbs rated shelf probably holds 600 lbs at the very minimum. Probably more! Engineers know this, so when they do stuff for themselves, they buy something that's under-rated for their need, knowing that the whole world is over-engineered to such a degree that you can violate these ratings routinely, and non-engineers are all chumps because we're paying extra money for 600-lbs rated shelves when you just need to know the over-engineering factor.\n\nIt seems vaguely ridiculous to me to think that engineers are really playing this game of \"they know that we know that they know that we know that they overload the shelves, so... we need to set the weight capacity at only 15% of what the shelf can hold.\" But that said, I've probably heard of more Kafka-esque nonsense.\n\nIs this really how engineering works? If I have a shelf that's rated to 400 lbs, can I pretty reliably expect it to hold 600 lbs or more?",

So I just want y'all's opinions on my stupid idea. 🤣\n\nWe have a big bank of cooling towers that supply ALL our cooling via evaporation. In the summer we get ridiculously humid and therefore can't evaporate and cool efficiently. If we built an enclosure on the side of the towers, where the fans pull the air through, and then made a large intake line that had a filter and desiccant in it, then would that actually dry the air enough to help with evaporation in the summer?\n\nIt seems laughable in practice, but if the dessicant removes the humidity, and the filter keeps the dessicant from getting fouled, then we would have dryer air being pulled in the sides of the cooling tower. \n\nEdit: apparently I used the word efficiency wrong. I just care about Delta T. Extra electricity bill be damned. When I say efficiency I mean more cooling relative currently abilities \n\nEdit 2: We have ammonia chillers already. But, the heat generated in the chillers via compression is removed using the cooling tower water. So since we can't get our cooling water cold enough, then our chiller capacity is capped by lack of cooling. We also don't have the physical space or downtime required to add or replace the old equipment. ",

      "content": "My friends and I are competing in the Kinetic Sculpture Race this Saturday. The goal is to carry this puppet for about 14 miles. Since this picture was taken, we have added numerous enhancements to the sculpture, and it now weighs over 80 pounds.\n\nThe original idea was to have someone carry the center support pole in a flag bearer's cup; however, the structure has become too heavy for this to be feasible over long distances. We are now trying to build a wheeled base to insert the support pole into (which is now a 1\" piece of aluminum rod).\n\nI have attached a sketch of what several potential designs may look like. Beyond these conceptions, what other ways would you suggest being able to push a top-heavy sculpture over a long distance? Additionally, this structure must be entirely human-powered, capable of withstanding sand, mud, and be detachable for use in water. As the structure is mostly waterproof covering, foam, and pool noodles, it floats considerably well, and we plan on pulling it through the water while swimming, with the idea being that we attach it to the wheeled device upon exiting the water portion to continue pushing it.\n\nWe can weld and have several bikes we can chop up to convert into a cart thing. What other viable options are there? Please feel free to ask any questions, as this is a weird project.\n\n[Link to photo of sculpture](https://imgur.com/a/vc1SBCc)\n\n[Link to screenshot of design brainstorm](https://imgur.com/a/MlgPmsN)",

      "title": "A very shallow beam in a very thin floor",
      "content": "Hi, I created a problem for myself that I would like to solve in an elegant way. I am designing a laneway house. This is my first attempt at architectural design, so I don't know much, but I do have the habit of digging deeply into problems as I encounter them. I want my structure to have 2x4 walls and floors. Building code does not prohibit this, but practical considerations make it difficult. One major problem is that it is hard to make the floors stiff enough.\n\nMy plan is to use short 2x4 joists laid between sturdy beams, so that the 2x4 spans comply with the prescriptive residential code (BC Building Code Part 9). When it comes to beams, BCBC says they need to be engineered and signed off. I thought I would go ahead and engineer a beam. While I can't sign off, I can certainly try to engineer. Structural steel should do the trick, should be easy, right?\n\nIt turns out that structural steel is not nearly as strong as I imagined. Two lengths of 3x4 angle iron spanning 9 feet are way too bendy to support the 370 pounds per foot required by code. In fact this arrangement supports only about 30 pounds per foot at L360 deflection, a small fraction of what is needed.\n\nI decided to learn beam theory and do the job properly. I quickly understood that beam theory is why you get a four year degree to be a structural engineer. I lowered my sights to learning enough principles of beam theory to be able to extrapolate from existing span tables.\n\nTo do this extrapolation I identified some basic principles:\n\n* Deflection increases with the cube of beam length\n* Deflection decreases inversely with the cube of beam depth\n* Deflection decreases inversely with beam width\n* Deflection decreases inversely with tensile strength\n\nThose cubic relations explain why my first beam design attempt failed so miserably. Four inches is just a very tiny beam.\n\nAnother one I am not completely sure of, but seems to be in the ballpark:\n\n* A central support decreases deflection of each half span by roughly 30%\n\nAnd here is a funny one that I hope is right, as I rely on it to avoid doing detailed second moment of area calculations:\n\n* Turning a flat bar of a given height on its side to be a flange, offset by that height from another flange, doubles its contribution to stiffness\n\nAnyway, what I do now is, I go to my manufacturer-supplied tables for lvl beam loads and look up the closest entry to the load I want. I correct for my actual length and beam depth by cubic extrapolation as above. Then I scale linearly to my actual beam width and tensile strength.\n\nWest Fraser kindly provides a number for bending stress, 5729 psi. This happens to correspond closely to the typical 40 MPa tensile strength given for wood. But I thought that bending stress is supposed to be .66 of yield strength, which is some fraction of ultimate tensile strength. What is up with that, does it mean that lvl is much stronger than wood, or is there some reason they are able to use ultimate tensile strength as the bending stress for wood?\n\nIn any case, I want to use A36 mild steel for my beams, the reason being that I can make the beam hollow and run cables through it. I use .66 of 260 MPa as the typical A36 bending stress and 40 MPa as the bending stress of West Fraser's lvl. This says that A36 is 4.3 times stronger than lvl. Is this ratio in the ballpark? I thought steel would be much stronger than that, but of course it is mild steel and there is a reason it is cheap.\n\nAnyway, the table lookup and extrapolation factors above allow me to determine the distributed load capacity of a simple steel bar pretty accurately. (I think. Please correct me if I am wrong.) So then I go ahead and dream up beam configurations made up of multiple flat steel bars. I place each bar in either a web or flange position, and double the stiffness contribution of the latter, following my rule of thumb above.\n\nSo now I can think about beam strength in simple terms: what is the equivalent number of flat bars? Multiply by the load capacity of a single flat bar, and voila, I have my beam strength.\n\nThis is where I wish I could post an image, but it looks to me like this sub does not allow it. Fair enough. I can post an image on another sub and link it from here if it seems useful. In any case, I can now describe a beam I have modeled, that seems to meet the requirement of supporting 370 pounds per foot while being entirely contained inside a four inch floor.\n\nTake two pieces of angle iron, bolt them together back to back, creating a \"Z beam\". Put two Z beams face to face, so that the profile down the length looks like a hat. The angle iron legs are all four inches, so the complete beam is four inches tall and 16 inches wide. With .25 inch thickness, my extrapolation method above says that I meet L360 at 433 pounds per linear foot, comfortably over my 370 pound requirement.\n\nAnd this is the question I wish to ask engineers: am I making sense? What have I missed? My \"double Z beam\" seems to make sense in a spreadsheet, but does it make sense in real life?\n\nI wonder if I should be worried about buckling in my very asymmetric Z beam. Anyway, I think this is already enough of a text wall, so that's it for now. Beam theory is fun, isn't it?\n\n(edit) For context, here is [some imagery](https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/1kdod4j/laneway_house_core_wall/).",

Like, imagine a 3.0L V10 with around 300 cc per cylinder, shouldn’t that be able to rev to 13,000 rpm too, especially if we use electric motors to fill in the low end torque?\n\nI know there are cost and market reasons for why this hasn’t really happened, but I’m more curious about the engineering side of it. Are there actual limits (like vibrations, heat management, reliability) that would stop a small-cc, high-cylinder-count NA engine from revving that high in a real supercar? Or is it just that nobody’s bothered because it’s so niche and expensive?",

      "content": "Hi all,\n\nNew first time homeowner dealing with 2 bowing basement walls in a finished basement with currently no water intrusion. One is bowed 1.5 inches, the other 1 inch. Multiple horizontal cracks. One side is definitely due to poor drainage (the 1.5 inch) which I am working on fixing, and the other is against a driveway that has a good grade.\n\nI've had multiple contractors, basement companies, and even a civil engineer out (no structural engineers in my area that do residential). All the basement companies suggested carbon fiber straps and filling the cracks, quotes range from 6k for sections of the wall to 15k for both walls entirely (for CF straps and filling cracks; steal is in general 20 percent more). The civil engineer couldn't speak to the efficacy of carbon fiber on CMU walls, but said it is a legit product used on analogous cases in the civil engineering world. A GC friend that came out said he also couldn't speak to the efficacy of CF but suggested steal beams, as he knows those would work. In any case, of course the goal is to stop the movement, not to bring the wall back to plumb.\n\nI am actively monitoring the wall (measuring weekly to determine movement) and we are actively saving money to solve. Thankfully this looks to have been around for some time, but everyone I've had out has said it's impossible to know if it's going to get worse.\n\nI am very handy and have found DIY CF strap products (literally the same ones some of the basement companies would use) online, but after discussion with the wife we think in terms of resale having a pro company come out and give their stamp would look better to future buyers rather than a DIY solution. Which is unfortunate, since I could do both walls for less than 1000.\n\nAnyway, on to the question to you all: should we prefer steal or CF? CF option looks attractive as 1. Basement is finished so we could repaint over it and 2. It's cheaper. The steal would be harder to finish over and it's more expensive. However, I really want piece of mind over this: honestly the new house has caused all sorts of new anxieties and stressors when I feel like it should be a dream!\n\nThank you all for your experiences and suggestions.",

Hope I can get some help here.\n\nCurrently designing a linear actuator for a prop item I'm building in which I designed everything around this particular [motor](https://www.servocity.com/2-737-rpm-premium-planetary-gear-motor/). It doesn't specify the mechanical load it can handle. I've already made the limits switches to control how far it can go as well as the DPDT switch to control the polarity. So far the circuit works as it should. Now here's my question.\n\n1. There are no ball bearing to help guide it. I designed the piston rod to be in a hexagonal shape with the frame around it. Are ball bearings absolutely needed? If so, can I put the ball bearings on the piston rod itself?\n2. Since I don't know the mechanical load it can handle, should I have the piston rod as light as possible? The piston rod is close to 2 feet long in which another linear actuator in connected on the other end. If so, I would need to just 3d print the base that holds the ACME screw nut and make the rest out of cardboard.\n3. Do I need a gearbox? I built the frame to be a direct drive to which I wanted this thing to open and close as fast as possible.",

      "content": "Hi, I'm working on a custom acoustic cabinet for a built-in fridge (Bosch KIR41NSE0), and I'm running into a mechanical challenge. I’ve uploaded a short GIF: [https://postimg.cc/phCQLKXf](https://postimg.cc/phCQLKXf)\n\n**Problem**:  \nI need to link the cabinet's outer door with the fridge door. The fridge is built-in and designed to work with sliding rail kits, but I can’t use those because of my custom design constraints.\n\nThe complication is that both doors rotate, but their pivot points are **not aligned**—the fridge door's hinge is deeper inside, while the cabinet door swings on standard butt hinges (paumelles). When closed, the doors align fine, and when both are open at 90°, they also align. However, the path between those two positions differs due to the pivot offset. A rigid connection would bind or stress the doors.\n\n**What I need**:  \nA **flexible linkage** that allows the outer door to drive the fridge door during opening/closing — accommodating the changing distance between them as they rotate on different axes.\n\nHas anyone dealt with this kind of problem before? Any clever DIY or mechanical linkage solutions to handle **differing rotational centers** while maintaining alignment at key angles (0° and 90°)?\n\nThanks in advance for your ideas — this one’s got me scratching my head :'(\n\nCountry: France",

      "content": "Hello,\n\nSomething that's always baffled me on a car is the differential. I understand it's purpose, which is to allow the wheels to turn at different speeds. I understand that you'd want different kinds of differentials for different purposes, for example a racecar would like an LSD and an offroad car would like a locking differential. However I don't really understand how they function in general or how you'd tune an LSD for a racecar. Articles give vague explanations about how differentials function and the advantages and disadvantages of each type, but that's it really. I studied mechanics at college for 2 years, but it wasn't too in-depth about differentials.\n\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\\-How exactly does one wheel travel faster than another?\n\n\\-How would you decide the percentage of acceleration lock for a racecar? (I believe deceleration lock is incrementally increased until there's no lift-off oversteer, increasing reliability to not drift around corners?)\n\n\\-Where does the torque get sent on each type? (I believe unlocked differentials are 50/50, locked differentials are 50/50, and LSDs send more power to the heavier wheel. For example if the heavier wheel is 1,000kg and the lighter wheel is 500kg, it'd be 67/33. Or if the heavier wheel is 550kg and the lighter wheel is 450kg it'd be 55/45. Is that right?\n\n\\-Which type of LSD method is the best and why?\n\n\n\nThank you",

I use greenhouses/hoophouses to hold moisture, with 70% aluminet detached shade cloth over them, and grow a few things outdoors with some significant cover. The number of plants that can survive here otherwise are a very few specialists, of which only chiles and carefully maintained pecans are of economic importance.\n\nI am installing some new small greenhouses ([Planta 26](https://plantagreenhouses.com/products/sungrow-26), and a couple of wood ones) to focus on flower cultivation. Using the Planta as an example, you add your own roof vents that are purchased separately.  My thinking is generally to align the axis of maximum wind movement with the dominant wind direction in the hottest part of the year. Using something like the rosette below as a guide, I've been mostly putting intakes facing Southeast, and outputs facing Northwest. Is this sensible?\n\nWhen it comes to putting the new vents on the Planta, I'm not sure how to arrange them. Should I put all of the intake vents on one end facing NE, and all of the outgoing vents on the other end facing SW, so that air is forced to travel the length of the greenhouse, maybe on a slight grade with the end venting hot air higher? Should I stagger inputs and outputs across the length, and hope cooler air doesn't just pass over the structure without meaningfully entering?\n\nThank you in advance to anyone who has tips to offer.

      "content": "I was seeing a discussion on another site about transients knocking out a power inverter. My main experience with self-generated power was aboard ship, where we often would cut in loads (bow thrusters, turret hydraulics) which were an appreciable fraction of our main generator capacity. However, with all of that rotating mass (generator rotor + prime mover) spinning at synchronous speed as we cut a big load in, any transient was momentary, a couple tenths of a second at most.\n\nLet's say that you wanted to have essential systems, including refrigeration, aboard a yacht connected to an inverter power system so that you could supply them from alternators on the propulsion engines without having to run your onboard \"hotel\" Diesel generator during an extended cruise. Does anyone out there offer something like an electrical machine with an attached flywheel that could run in parallel with the output of the inverter to \"cushion\" any transients if a relatively large load started automatically?",

      "content": "I read some advice in another subreddit that there's no difference in discharge rate of batteries if they're left in a device with the power turned off (we assume the device has no standby power drain), as compared to if the batteries are left in their original packaging. The reason given is because \"It's an open circuit, so that's just physics.\"\n\nAnd I think that's true? But also the physicist in me wants to say, \"Yeah, but putting the batteries into the device in series makes a higher-voltage package, and higher-voltage packages are going to discharge faster.\"\n\nThat said, I'm not an engineer. I just took some physics in college, so I'm happy to admit I'm very ignorant and I could definitely be wrong. What's the truth? If I have a device that I don't expect to use for a long time, should I remove the batteries before storing the device?\n\n(I assume a very high-quality battery that won't corrode; I'm concerned here only with discharge rate)\n\n  \nEDIT: Cleaning up my terminology. I understand now that \"self-discharge\" is not the right term. I don't know what's the right term for \"discharging time of a battery in a device that's turned off\" but that's what I'm interested in. ",

      "content": "My very first issue is that the joint area between these two parts is hidden underneath a kind of shield, so it’s impossible to tell just by looking whether they were bonded using an adhesive or joined by heat welding. The only certainty is that the material is polypropylene as it’s marked \"PP\" on that shield.\n\nI could try using a long flathead screwdriver and/or a putty knife with a hammer to force them apart but this would certainly damage the joint area, so that’s my last resort. I might first try heating the area with a hot air gun or slowly pouring boiling water into the shield's interstitial gaps, although there’s a risk of deforming the joint due to the heat.\n\nSo I'm here to ask if, before these methods, it’s worth trying to use a strong solvent that could dissolve or soften any adhesive that may have been used to bond the two PP parts. This would help me determine whether an adhesive was used or not. Which solvents would you recommend to try for this attempt?",

When starting the pump and compressor, the cold head assembly makes this awful, for lack of a better descriptor, moaning noise. It's definitely something mechanical because the noise is very cyclical.\n\nI've done most things short of completely disassembling the motor itself, but I doubt that's the problem. I've replaced most components on the cold head and the shaft and bearings that attach to the motor to pump the cold head, as well as a few retaining rings on the cold head. Also cleaned the cold head assembly, and cleaned the helium going into the cryo.\n\nI noticed that, with the bearings and shaft in place, without connecting the cold head (or the helium) it sounds pretty good, but when we connect the cold head itself to the assembly, still no helium, and turn it on, it makes a bit of a moaning noise which I think is amplified once we seat it into the pump housing.\n\nThe cryo does seem to start to get cold, but take quite a while to really make a noticable difference (like 3 hours just to start to get a bit cool). I'm even wondering if maybe the temperature sensor is broken considering how long this takes or if it's just because of the odd noise it's making. Anyone have any thoughts?",

      "content": "Let’s say we have 3 gears connected with the first gear having some force/torque applied to it by an external force. The first gear spins as a result of the torque and applies a force to the next gear in line that causes it to spins. This repeats once more from the 2nd to 3rd gear.\n\nAccording to newton’s third law for every force there is an equal and opposite reactionary force. Since the gear with the initial torque applied to it has to apply a force to the 2nd gear since they are meshed together, the 2nd gear must apply an equal and opposite force on gear 1. This torque being applied by this force from gear 2 is going in the opposite direction of the torque from the external force applied to gear 1. My understanding is that this causes the net torque on the 1st gear to be less than if it was not connected to the 2nd gear. This would be the same case as well for the 2nd gears interaction with the 3rd gear and so on. \n\nIs this right ? When we use a system of gears are we slowly diminishing the maximum possible torque that each gear could have been experiencing by connecting them to a gear that’s going to apply an opposite force and receive a torque less than if it was just having the external force applied to it without  being connected to the other gears?\n\nIf I am wrong, where am I misunderstanding?",

I am looking at using a gorilla wagon with air tires and removable sides, coupled with a block and tackle system to help safely control the trip up and down. I would love advice on which block and tackle you would recommend (at a maximum we are talking about 200 lb with my daughter and the wagon.). The ramp is 50 ft long so will require a fair amount of rope.  I was leaning towards a 4:1 ratio system to allow 1-2 people to be able to safely assist her. Thanks for any advice - I would especially appreciate advice on the specific block and tackles that would be reliable for this as well as any other ideas of how to help get her down the ramp that are different than listed.  Whatever she rides on down the ramp needs to be low to the ground for her comfort/feeling safe, and needs to be easy to get in and out of with little to no side barriers. Thanks so much!",

      "content": "I work for a small local pickle manufacturer and I’m trying to make one part of the job safer and easier on our bodies.\n\nWe use a 40-gallon tilt braising pan for hot water baths to sterilize our pickle jars. The issue is: we currently place the jars into metal baskets and manually lower them into and out of the boiling water. It’s a two-person job, and we get splashed or burned often.\n\nI want to find a safer way to load and unload the jars. My idea is to install a perforated platform inside the braising pan that sits at the bottom and can be raised and lowered with a lever mounted on the outside. That way, we could lift the platform out of the water, place the baskets on it, then lower them in safely — no more lifting heavy baskets over boiling water.\n\nI’m imagining:\n\n● A platform that raises and lowers vertically\n\n● Perforated to allow water to circulate\n\n● Controlled by a lever or crank outside the pan\n\n● Possibly with guide rails to keep the platform level\n\n\nI’m not sure how to draw or spec this out to explain it to my boss or figure out the best mechanical design. If anyone can help visualize or engineer a simple lift solution like this, I’d be super grateful.",

      "content": "Hi Reddit Engineers,\nI'm looking for an adhesive that can bond glass to glass, and which can be cleanly removed if necessary.\n\nI am building a [Snowblind mod](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=snowblind%20mod%20pc) for my PC. Look at videos at the link to understand what it is, but basically a clean LCD glass panel without the backlight is stuck on the side of a glass pc side panel.\n\nI have a glass LCD panel and a glass side panel and would like to use some glue that can bond these two together but which can also be removed.\n\nI'm 100% sure that this exists because as I was dismantling this LCD panel, the glass pane was in a plastic frame, and it was glued to it using a very thin (less than 1mm) string of adhesive around the perimeter. It was bonded so strong that when I tried pulling the LCD out from the front I thought it was glued in place permanently or screwed down with some bracket, but when I finally got behind the panel and applied some pressure, it came right off.\n\nThe glue reminded me of the stuff that used to be used for cover CDs if anyone remembers that far back. I.e. sticking a paper or plastic CD envelope to the front of a color magazine so that it can be removed without tearing the front cover. It was transparent and rubbery. Even a good 15-20 years after it was installed at the factory, it was still elastic and stretched a lot when being removed, but it wasn't tacky ir breaking into pieces or patches like the adhesive backing of a sticker would, for example. I still have pieces of it around if anyone would like to suggest some test to find out what it is, and I can get some basic solvents for testing, if that helps.\n\nThe glue should unbond without any solvents, as the glass side panel I'm using has white strips that could get damaged by solvents, and it has mounting hardware which clearly seems to be glued to the glass pane of the side panel. You can see the case [here](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/torrent/torrent-compact/white-rgb-tg-clear-tint/). You can find closer shots of the side panel [here](https://youtu.be/HBxo2_lwKps?t=162) and [here](https://youtu.be/eDAliD92xC4?t=171).\n\nA water soluble adhesive might not be safe as there are humidity swings here.\n\nNote that the glue doesn't have to be optically perfect. I only want to place it around the perimeter. Also if you watch the videos explaining what a Snowblind mod is, you'll see that because the backlight is gone, the panel is more of a visual effect at this point rather than a real graphical display, so it doesn't need to be optically perfect. So I'm not really looking for \"optical glue\" in any sense of the word, just something transparent, strong, and removable.\n\nI would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks!",

I do not know what it currently weights however I am planning to take it to work to weight the counterweight next week.

I want to see what is best, or what is standard practice.\n\nIt's for a knife gate valve which uses solenoids to allow air to open and close it. This is what I've come up with so far (stripped out the equipment tag, just the last part here):\n\n    ZSO <-- valve is open signal [position, switch, open]\n    ZSC <-- valve is closed signal [position, switch, closed]\n    YYO <-- activate solenoid #1 to open the gate [state, auxiliary, open]\n    YYC <-- activate solenoid #2 to close the gate [state, auxiliary, close]\n    Y?? <-- activate to purge product [basically uses compressed air to clear the valve of any product when it's closing]\n\nI have no idea what to do for that purge command. And I'm probably way off on the other ones too. It seems like the tags in ISA 5.1 are made more for signals that go into the PLC rather than commands coming out of a PLC. What have you seen done, or what would you choose?\n\nNone of these are activated by hand, they will all be discrete inputs/outputs from a PLC in the end. That's why I picked \"Y\" as the first letter, because I figured the PLC was kind of like an event driven state machine. It will be programmed to open/close the valve based on other conditions. I picked the second \"Y\" because of note 25 in the ISA 2009 version \"Output/Active Function auxiliary devices and functions \\[Y\\] include, but are not limited to, solenoid valves, relays, and computing and converting devices and functions\". I seen several people online using HS \\[hand, switch\\] for controls from a PLC but that doesn't make sense to me since there are no manual hands involved here. Am I just way off base here?

      "content": "I am looking for a *silent* step down transformer, or at least one that is inaudible in a quiet room.\n\nI live in the Netherlands (230V) and just took delivery of a beautiful Nakamichi TM-1 and 2 from the US.  \nI found a small 220 -> 110v transformer, a Nedis POCO104, which looks to be perfect for the job, but it hums like an electric shaver, very loud. As the TM-1 is an alarm clock I'd like to use it in my bedroom which is just impossible with the noise this transformer makes. I tried padding the insides with some rubber pads which decreases the noise significantly, but its still clearly audible so unsuitable for bedroom use.\n\nSo I've come here to ask for advice, would anyone know a silent transformer? Preferably also small but silent is the most important.\n\nI found some options that claim to be \"near-silent\" but those are 1000+ watts and costs upwards of 250 bucks, which is a little overkill. The little alarm clock has a peak draw of 21w which I doubt I'll ever reach as this is probably on full volume.\n\nOr if there are other options to get this to work I'd love to hear them too. I was thinking since the wattage is so low there might be other options that I'm not aware of.\n\nThe TM-1 appears to have only ever been sold in the US, so there are no other versions with different voltages, so afaik no drop-in replacement internal transformers to convert it to 220. It also shouldn't matter if its 60 or 50hz as this alarm clock doesn't rely on grid frequency to keep time.\n\nNote for the mods - I extensively searched the web and although I found plenty of potential candidates, no webshop mentions anything about noise, so the only way to find out is to buy everything and try it myself, or ask other people's experience. I hope thats okay. I already asked this same question on r/AskElectricians, where I haven't gotten a single comment yet, and r/AskElectronics, which was very helpful until it my post got deleted.\n\nWe barely have any physical shops left selling these types of products, even the bigger hardware stores simply don't have any transformers in stock, only online, so there is nowhere near me to look at some options IRL.",

      "content": "Hi All,\n\nDo any of you have experience with propane liquid level float switches?  I'm trying to avoid doing anything dumb here, but I need to spec a liquid level float switch that can go either inside the 1,000 gallon propane tank, or alongside it.  My application uses liquid propane off the bottom of the tank to a generator.  I need a dry contact to open when liquid level in the tank is down to about half.  At this point I am looking at piping [this type of float switch](https://www.gemssensors.com/docs/default-source/resource-files/catalog-pages/catalog-a_ls8005-ls159000.pdf?Status=Master&sfvrsn=a9450194_7) from liquid at the bottom to vapor at the top, with the switch itself about halfway up the tank on the side.  The tank relief valve is at 375 psi.  Any have red flags to throw up or better ideas?  Are there simple float switches available that would just insert to the propane tank?  I can't seem to find any rated for it that actually have a switch and not just a gauge...\n\nEdit: Nevermind.  I found that the switch I'm looking at requires minimum specific gravity of 0.75, so I need to find another solution.  Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n  \nEdit 2: I found an optical switch sensor that works with propane, threaded into a vertical pipe with a tee outside the tank with an equalizing line.  Similar to level sensing for an Ammonia system.  Feel free to PM me if anyone needs to know more detail.",

      "content": "No, this is not a question asking for renovation advice 😀\n\nFor context, in the city where I live (Vancouver) there is a lot of discussion about how new condo builds mostly contain \"shoebox\" units, meaning very small (<500 sqft) and only containing a single bedroom, or no bedroom at all. These units are perceived to be selling much more slowly than larger ones. I read an interesting comment about how—if Vancouver solves its housing shortage in the distant future—these undesirable units could end up totally empty.\n\nNow, my crystal ball is in the shop so I have no idea if any of that would happen, and this is not an economics or politics sub, but it made me curious as to what could actually be done from an engineering standpoint with a tower that contained units that the market deemed were too small to be desirable.\n\nWould it be possible to knock down walls between a couple 500 sqft units to create a single, 1000 sqft unit? Or are the walls too structural? If so, could a hole be punched for a door at least? Has this ever been done anywhere?\n\nThe unit layout could be a bit odd, and you'd obviously end up with some duplicated plumbing fixtures, but those seem a lot more practical to reno out than a concrete wall.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m currently doing a project at an construction company, where my main assignment is to research and improve **long-term capacity planning**.\n\nThe company lacks clear insight into staffing needs beyond 6 months. Ideally, they want to stretch that visibility to **at least 12 months**. Previously, they used **projected revenue** as a proxy for capacity (using a rough FTE-to-turnover ratio), but this approach lacked accuracy and didn’t reflect the actual workload.\n\nThey tried to replace this with an Excel model where:\n\n* Each **row** is a project\n* Each **column** is a calendar week\n* Each **cell** contains the estimated **FTE demand**, based on pre-calculated hours\n\nThis structure actually makes sense for them, and is exactly what management wants:  \n*\"In week 8 of 2026, we’ll be working on three construction sites. Based on estimates, those projects require 6 engineers. We employ 30 — so what are the other 24 doing?\"*\n\nIn other words, they want to **identify capacity gaps or underutilization**, not build a full resource scheduling system or Gantt chart.\n\nThe structure works — but the **input doesn't**.\n\nIt relies heavily on manual updates from PMs, and when the data isn’t consistently maintained, the whole forecast becomes unreliable.\n\nThe PMs **aren’t the end users** of the output (management is), so if the interface is too complicated or fragile, they either skip it or enter data inconsistently.\n\nThat’s really the core problem — not the tool, but the **workflow and usability** for the people entering the data.\n\nI rebuilt the Excel-based system using **VBA** to reduce manual input and prevent user errors. It’s now being tested by PM's and works as intended — maintaining the same familiar matrix-style interface.\n\nHowever, every success brings new challenges. The main issue now is that the system isn't designed for **multi-user access** — each tester is working with their own isolated version.  \nThey can't see each other's planned FTEs, and all the output has to be manually combined externally to get a complete overview.\n\nVBA worked for a prototype, but it’s not multi-user, not secure, and not scalable.  \nI’m now exploring better options — possibly **Google Sheets + Apps Script** or even **Power Apps + SharePoint**, depending on cost and complexity.\n\nI’ve noticed that most planning tools online are aimed at **detailed task-level scheduling** or individual resource management — which is not what I need. This is **high-level**, **project-based**, and **forward-looking**.\n\nVBA worked for a prototype, but it’s not **multi-user**, not secure, and not scalable.  \nI’m now exploring better options — possibly **Google Sheets + Apps Script** or even **Power Apps + SharePoint**, depending on cost and complexity.\n\nI’ve noticed that most planning tools online are aimed at **detailed task-level scheduling** or individual resource management — which is not what I need.

The Idea is that we don't want the motor mount coming loose and damaging the vehicle. I understand that the pre-load and clamping force is desired to keep these components together but is the preload that important? If the idea is to keep the components from coming apart wouldn't the use of say a grade 8 bolt, Locktight and for added measure a lock washer be sufficient to keep the bolt from loosening? Thus, keeping these components together?\n\n Additionally, these motor mounts are made of aluminum and the bolts of steel in my query. As such wouldn't Galvanic Corrosion occur over time further bonding the mount components? \n\n I would appreciate any useful, knowledgeable, or practical opinions on this topic if you have them. Thank you.  ",

The top object, on the other hand, should stay attached to the other.\n\nA representation of the setup can be seen here [Representation](https://ibb.co/FLqshj2q).\n\nWhat I've been trying to understand is the force that the suction mechanism should bear considering the accelerations and forces involved.\n\nSince I can't measure the time for the crash (and deceleration), I am having a lot of troubles finding a way of calculating the forces involved and can't really interpret the results because the object should stay attached (at least from the supposed suction force) but it is being thrown and does not stay attached.\n\nBoth objects start from rest and are accelerated until the bottom one hits the wall. I have an accelerometer attached that provides me with accelerations at *every* instant. I know the masses and although I haven't done it I can infer the velocity at the moment of the crash from the acceleration graph.\n\nI've been trying to understand if I can calculate through momentum or if I should somehow approach this using energy equations.

All well and good.\n\nHowever, it's possible to use a pole and guy lines instead of one (or both) of the trees and apparently angling the poles so that the bottoms are in towards the hammock decreases tension on the poles and the guylines.\n\nClearly, if the pole is perfectly vertical, the shear force inwards at the point where the hammock is attached is 853.2 N - which the guy lines are going to have to resist.\n\nHow do I calculate the force on the guy lines and how does this change if the pole is angled (effectively changing the angle at which the hammock is hanging off the pole) and how do I calculate the downward force through the pole itself?\n\nI hope my explanation gets across what I'm asking.\n\nSetups similar to the Tensa solo - [https://www.tensaoutdoor.com/product/tensa-solo-hammock-stand/?v=c97b334ffd41](https://www.tensaoutdoor.com/product/tensa-solo-hammock-stand/?v=c97b334ffd41) \\- and how changing angle of poles and angle of guy lines changes the forces on the components.\n\nThanks in advance.",

For reference I looked at ali express and amazon for metal parts and i also looked at lego technic and 3d printers but they all seem kind of expensive. I also don’t want to get something I won’t use in the long term… like i would rather spend more now and save in the long term. \n\nIf you’re wondering the type of stuff i’d like to build in the future (maybe after years of experience but still) would include:\n-rc car\n-self balancing robot\n-robot running a local llm\n-rocket\n-random inventions\n\nThank you in advance for anyone that takes the time to read and respond,\n\nKind regards!",

What I'm trying to determine is: given a 59 Newton force (wind load) against the top of a 30 meter mast attached dead center to a 2 meter wide base: what counterweight would I need to load the edge of the base with to prevent the mast from tipping over? \n\nI'm reading Mathematics at Work (4th ed, Horton) chapter 17. Trouble is, I don't think this is a simple lever since the mast attaches at a 90º angle in the middle of the base. I don't think it's a compound lever since the attach point doesn't articulate. My assumption is the fulcrum would be point C (fig 2) since that is where the base would pivot if it were hypothetically being pushed over by a wind load upon point D (fig 2) but I don't know how that translates to determine a counterweight at point A.\n\nEdit: there would be counterweight at each of the four corners of the square base.",

Gears could be rotated with hand crank or motor. It does not technically need to be 32 pieces and could be 8 or 16 though that would be less ideal. They cannot be larger than 29-30mm and must all be next to each other to accomplish the task. ",

      "content": "Hi. There has been a serious national blackout in Spain, and through all the explanations I heard something strange that I don't understand. There has been said a lot of times that traditional, massive and rotatory energy generators such as turbines benefit the frequency stability to the power grid, since this massive rotatory elements carry a lot of inertia, and are good resisting and correcting variations of the frequency of the system, even more than the electronic elements that transform the continuous current from solar panels (wich were generating a VERY big part of Spain's power at the blackout moment) to alternating current. The thing that is strange to me is that this inertial elements are more stable and more capable of resisting the fluctuations of the grid than electronic inverters. From my perspective, i thought that this electronic control would be much more reliable than a physic system that just works by itself, but seems like is not the case. (obviusly the turbines don't just work by themselves, they are heavily controlled, but not in a 100% controlled way as electronic inverters). Anyone knows why this happen? Can anyone clarify something about this? How is it possible that an electronic element has less control than an inertial element?\n\nThanks",

      "content": "I'm attempting to build an artificial human for an (art?) project. I'm trying to build it using only mechanical technology; springs, pullies, magnets, etc. The two big challenges I have are:\n\n1. The arms should \"float\" in position and have the same range of motion as a regular, meat-based human, so they need to be counterbalanced somehow. The problem is that it requires the greatest counter-force when the arms are horizontal and nearly nothing when vertical. I wanted to avoid using actual weights as it seemed... clunky and uninteresting? So I tried doing it with pullies and springs with the shoulder mechanism feeding back into the torso but it never worked and in one occasion pulled itself to pieces under tension. I'm stumped. \n\n2. The whole thing should be able to stand. I was thinking to balance all the spring forces in it's joints then use magnets in the soles of its feet, but without even attempting this it seems unlikely to work. \n\nCan anyone point me towards  anything similar that has been successfully accomplished in the past?\n\n",

      "content": "\nForgive me. I'm not an engineer and basically have an 8th grade education. So I don't know all the proper terminology and the like.\n\nThe short of what I'm trying to do here is build a DIY 2K meter-mix machine. For metering, mixing, and dispensing 2-part polyurethane.\n\n...\n\nI'm using 2-part polyurethane formulas with relatively odd mix ratios. And fairly fast pot life. The PUR formulas are for casting resin and not PUR foam.\n\nI'm casting the PUR into open pour molds. The purpose of this is for a hobby. \n\nTherefore, I don't need the precision a $50K+ commercial meter-mix machine offers. Relatively close in the metering is fine for me. But I do need to mix and dispense fairly quickly. Because of the short pot life.\n\nThe final mixture of A and B will be anywhere between 65ml and 100ml per shot. Depending on the mold I'm casting into.\n\n....\n\nMy general idea is this. \n\nComponents A and B will be in their own respective reservoirs. Each component will have a dedicated and inexpensive DC gear pump. which will pump each component into a mix chamber(Which is where the two components ultimately meet). \n\nThe \"metering\" of each component I imagine being handled via PWM motor controllers. Each dialed in relative to the proper mix ratio. I'm choosing that method for metering and feeding the materials to the mix chamber because it's easiest for me to wrap my brain around.\n\nThe mix chamber I imagine being a clear PVC pipe, essentially. Probably a Schedule 80 PVC pipe with an ID of 60mm.\n\n Each component will be fed into the mix chamber via npt check valves on opposite sides of the pvc pipe. Check valves to mitigate the possibility of any mixed material flowing back into the feed lines.\n\nHere's where I need help...\n\nIn this mix chamber I imagine would be a rod and piston to push the material out of the mix chamber, and through a mix nozzle.\n\nI imagine this rod and piston being pushed and retracted via a pneumatic cylinder. Which will attach to the mix chamber via a flange of some kind. But I can't find \"pistons\" when searching online without coming up with nothing but pistons for cars. And I'm not sure how I would attach this rod and piston to the rod of the pneumatic cylinder.\n\nI also need a fairly long piston. As I think I might try to cut grooves into the piston. And have a second set of check valves that go the opposite direction. The purpose of that being recirculating the materials while the piston is in \"push mode\", or whatever. But not married to this.\n\nI figure I might have to make my own piston here. \n\nHere are my questions:\n\nWill this idea work?\n\nHow would you do it if you had to make your own rod and piston for pushing the material out of the mix chamber? And how do you attach the rod of the pneumatic cylinder to this secondary rod and piston?\n\nLastly and ideally, the pneumatic cylinder would have mechanical stops or limits for both the forward stroke and reverse stroke. So that I can limit the position of the piston within the mix chamber.\n\nCan anyone point me in the direction of a pneumatic cylinder that would have an ≈50mm stroke, but with mechanical stops as described?\n\nMy budget for this entire project is probably $500 US.\n\nThanks ahead of time!\n\n \n\n",

      "content": "Hey there!  I've started a second (well, more like fourth ;) career as a teacher in a high school, and I've put together a pretty unusual program where I have teams entering aerospace design competitions targeted at undergrad and graduate students and winning.  We have a lot of need for environmental test, and what I have in my lab is pretty limited.\n\nI've got okay resourcing and can pay environmental test firms, but buying $40k+ pieces of test equipment doesn't make sense for my lab: the utilization would be very low.  At the same time, we'd like quicker feedback and I think there's a certain authenticity around having more students spend more time around qualification and test.  We may have to pay a lab for the \"real\" testing but being able to get approximate testing for subassemblies or early versions would be really great.  My target volumes are 10x10x5cm for small assemblies, ~25x15x15cm for entire systems.\n\nI'm eager to hear if anyone has any ideas as to what I could do.  Complicating my efforts is that searching for this is hard: there's a whole lot of homebrew classroom shaker systems intended to e.g. shake lego buildings in elementary school.  About the fanciest thing I've seen is a stepper motor on a plate, which could be a workable path for the smallest things.\n\n(I'm also interested in things like TVAC, etc.. I've seen things like classroom bell jar + peltier junctions to avoid cryogenics).",

      "content": "Hi,  \nAt my work place we've had a couple interesting problems come up which I'd like some input on.  \nMy first question involves an actuator moving a steel block (grey) between 2 stationary nylon blocks (blue).  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/jMmrAus  \nThe steel supports a large and asymmetrical load, resulting in the nylon blocks to wear out in different areas (note the trapezoidal shape). The movement of the overall structure is now very \"sticky\" and jitters up and down.  \nMy colleagues believe that it's because the nylon blocks and weights are uneven, so the steel mechanism is sitting at an angle within the nylon (makes sense to me). They believe that adding a weight (red) will help to balance out the weight so the mechanism is more central, so the movement will be smoother.  \nHowever, if we balance out this whole system with various weights, I'm concerned that as the nylon is still worn asymmetrically, over a period of time it will continue to apply friction to different points of the steel, again wearing unevenly, and will still cause the mechanism to tilt again.  \nWhat do you think?  \n\nMy other question involves a mechanism which was designed by a third party so we are curious about the design choice to use a 60Nm motor controlling effectively a seesaw.  \nhttps://imgur.com/a/nC6cxTg  \nI'm very roughly guessing the loads are 15kg each side and about 1m from the pivot, for simplification. This is about 30Nm moment when turning, which is much less than the motors maximum speced torque. I said that could be a factor of safety, as the motor is moving some heavy weights many hours nearly every day of the year. Additionally, the motor needs to decelerate the weight and push it the opposite direction, which would require a lot of force. \nMy colleague is concerned that, if someone were to put their body near the mechanism, the motor is still applying a 60Nm torque on the mechanism which only requires 30Nm, so it would be using the remaining 30Nm to crush the person, because motors will only provide their full torque rating(?).  \nI don't have much experience with motors and calculating their required torques, so I'm just guessing here, but I wouldn't assume that the motor is always applying the maximum torque, right? Wouldn't it depend on how the motor driver is controlling it or something?  \nThanks for any input, I'm asking here on my day off out of pure curiousity :)",

A previous assignment of ours shows 2 different op-amps, one in which the non-inverting terminal had an offset, and the other with the non-inverting end connected to ground. I'm wondering how you would know which one to use? I know for my assignment I'm using the one with an offset (because my lecturer told me), but how would I know to have an offset otherwise?",

      "content": "I'm a hobbyist prototyping a device that integrates a gyro+accelerometer to determine your dead-reckoned position in the Earth frame of reference. I've gone all-in on a 6DoF sensor (the ASM330), and it works *pretty well* but I'm noticing some weirdness in the data. Mostly, there seems to be a correlated error expressed between the axes. I assume this might be \"cross-axis sensitivity\"?\n\nTo clarify, what I see in practice is that the \"route\" you take when moving through space determines the final error you get when you return to \"home position\". I am not joking when I say I've spent like a year on-and-off trying to debug this, lol. I'm sure some of my firmware is buggy which might contribute to this, but I'm also wondering if cross-axis sensitivity is playing a role here. Or maybe some other attribute of the sensors like non-linearity.\n\nI'm getting ready to try a different sensor just for fun. When I look at the datasheet for these things, I've been tracking: \"rate noise\", \"nonlinearity\", \"cross-axis sensitivity\", and sometimes, \"random walk\". For both the gyro and the accelerometer. But no device is good for both sensors across all dimensions. My question is this: Which sensor would contribute more to such a class of error (accelerometer or gyroscope)? And which attribute(s) should I optimize for when choosing a candidate device for my next build?\n\nASM330 has pretty good gyro performance, but the accelerometer isn't best-in-class. I think I have to pick one: a good gyro or a good accelerometer. No matter how many times I read the glossary definitions or watch YouTube videos I still am not sure the difference between nonlinearity and cross-axis sensitivity. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading!",

I recently finished building my geodesic dome camper on a 4x8 ft utility trailer and I want to make it more aerodynamic. Currently I'm averaging 13 mpg when pulling the camper with my Subaru Outback. Normally I average 28 mpg when not pulling the camper. I'd love to make improvements that would result in 20 mpg. The camper is light weight (I can easily move it around by hand in my driveway). Panels are luan plywood. Struts of the dome are 4 ft 10 in long and are made from 2x3 lumber. Total height is 10 ft. Width is 7 ft 10 in. I've pulled it down the interstate for six hours at 70mph and it is very stable. I have a longer tongue on the trailer that I installed 20 years ago when I needed to haul very long lumber. I have the original shorter tongue and am thinking I'll reinstall that in hopes that bringing the camper closer to the car will help improve air flow over/around the camper. When I pull the camper long distances I have the Yakima roof top carrier on the Subaru in hopes that it will create better air flow over/around the camper.

I was thinking that it would be useful to have the thermometer in the pipe just before the faucet but I can't seem to find it anywhere. Does this exist? The only thing I see that's similar takes the temperature of the outside of a pipe. I was thinking that it could just be a meat thermometer probe with threads that is made to go into a T connector so that the tip of the probe is exactly in the middle of the water as it flows. Maybe allow the screen part to rotate and have like 8 locked positions so you can have the screen facing whatever angle you want. And it could run on a few volts DC so it wouldn't have a shock risk.\n\nMaybe constantly sitting in water would be an issue due to rust? Would the T cause flow issues with the plugged end? Maybe it would be better to make it in a straight pipe? But that would make replacement a pain.\n\nMaybe the temperature coming out of the faucet isn't exactly the same as this device would read? But I would think after a few seconds the faucet itself would be at the temperature of the water anyways and the difference wouldn't be that much. ",

I'm not auto mechanic, but I found it interesting that I'm getting a local minimum in my throttle positions vs. car speed curves for each gear. I'm looking for an intuitive and technical/mathematical explanation for this; should the car be stalling? the rpm isn't lower than 500.  \n  \nThis minimum is around the speeds when i typically shift gears ([https://imgur.com/htN0VsU](https://imgur.com/htN0VsU)). However the fuel economy appears to continue increasing at speeds below this throttle minimum, which seems counterintuitive ([https://imgur.com/gijfvff](https://imgur.com/gijfvff)). As if i could cruise in my car in 6th gear at 15 mph with the throttle almost fully open at get 55 mpg. Wouldn't this actually have very poor performance?",

Starter motors blip on and blip off...    \n\n\nMy motorcycle has official 'steps' for the gears in the manual,  the highest gear (6th) officially gets is to be employed at pretty much all speeds over 38 on level ground, so from 38 to 120 miles per hour, it is all done using a single gear.\n\nMy ev (most ev's) have really quick 0-60 times, all in one gear, and for a small fraction of a kwh consumed.   \n\nmy exwifes phev,  gets 20-30 miles range on the electric, (not counting occasional recoveries from stopping) then it's all gas--  so the store and back might be all electric.  \nAll other trips, when the battery is used up, it kicks over to gas for the rest.. \n\nit is a kludge,  all the elements of an electric car, + all the elements of a gas car.  \n**all of them**\n\nSo here's the thought, *why ALL the parts of an ice car.

And want to try test my own drone projects to do the same, I'm literally about to finish my mech degree and never had time to really look into it.\n\nSo this is the thought process on the theories I have so far (based on no real research).\n\n1. They have recorded flight data from thousands of manned flights where they trained the AI but this can only work with the help of the US air force. Though, if they did this, flight data from current fighter aircraft would not be suitable for newer designs due to different airfoil configuration, thrust capabilities and weight.  \n  \n2. They built an inhouse flight simulator that simulates the fluids on the airfoil and used that to train the aircraft - potentially integrating software such as Ansys (not sure)? Though the fluid simulations alone would need so much computing power and multiply that against the thousands of AI training simulations it would be very costly.   \n  \n3.  They trained the aircraft from manually controlling the UAV and used that as training data? Though with this method it would be costly as testing these physically may result in crashes thus more money to make a new prototype\n\n  \nJust note I don't have much knowledge on AI or ML but interested to learn in the future, and I hated using Ansys in college lmao\n\nI'm asking this as I want to try to make my fixed wing drone to work autonomously, but also want to optimize the airfoil designs. I have all the software but I won't have major computing power to work with unless I outsource it to data centres. If there's any software where I can test fly a model that can simulate fluid flow at the same time please let me know.",

      "content": "I've been playing pinball a bit lately. I found a couple of local arcades that have a good number of tables, and it's been fun. I mentioned to my uncle that I've particularly enjoyed a pinball game themed after Godzilla, and that I read the designer of the game is a former pinball champion (one of the all-time greats), who eventually became a pinball game designer.\n\nMy uncle rolled his eyes at that and said that they should have gotten a mechanical engineer, who would have done a better job.\n\nI basically said, well he's a pinball champion. He knows what makes a great game. He's probably played dozens, if not hundreds of pinball tables. He's probably put thousands of hours into playing pinball, so he knows what works, what doesn't, etc. He competes, so he knows what tables are the ones people want to buy. He probably has tons and tons of knowledge.\n\nMy uncle said, no. That's myopic. Just because you play pinball doesn't mean you're going to be good at designing a pinball table, because pinball is a mechanical system, so you want an engineer. This pinball champion, is he calculating the stress tensor on the ramp joints? Is he calculating the rigidity of the flippers? Is he calculating the impulse value? How's his vector calculus? If he's not calculating all of this stuff, he can't create the perfect loop for the ball because he doesn't know what the material tolerance for that metal is. He isn't taking into account the compression strength of the metal, and whether or not it can tolerate the force.\n\nThis led my uncle into one of his favorite rants, the SR-71 (a plane he'll bring into any conversation he's able to). He said, when they designed the SR-71 they didn't ask a bunch of pilots how to build the plane. They went to engineers. And those engineers determined that the metal in the plane would expand so much under the heat generated that it leaks fuel when you start it up, and it seals together perfectly when the plane is in the air. That's something only a mechanical engineer can calculate and do. No pilot is ever going to build that plane, so pilots could never build an SR-71.\n\nHe argues that by analogy, no pinball champion is ever going to build the SR-71 of pinball games. They're never going to build the pinball game that has ramps that exactly curve the right amount under the shear. They're never going to engineer the perfect pinball that has the exact compression under impact that you want for the perfect bounce. No pinball champion is ever going to calculate the propagation of force through a flipped to choose exactly the right material with exactly the right flex, to give it the exactly right launch for the ball into the precisely-machined ramp with sub-micron tolerance, to exactly fit that ball under exactly the conditions it has to make that shot.\n\nI said, but doesn't the table have to be fun? Isn't that the point? It's not about engineering perfection. At the end of the day, it's a game! It's supposed to be fun, not \"mechanically perfect\". And my uncle said look at the card game \"Magic the Gathering\". Lots of failed card games. The one game that has stood the test of time was designed by a guy named Richard Garfield, who has a PhD in Computer Science. So he's basically an engineer. \n\nMy uncle insists what you do is, you take your team of engineers. You have them comb through the data. They will create a mathematical model of what makes pinball fun, cross-reference the most popular pinball games, then they will mathematically design the optimal solution, because that's just what engineering is.\n\nI still kinda think my uncle is wrong, because I can look at the Godzilla pinball machine and say, \"But is just IS fun. So there has to be something to this.\" And I think it makes sense to have a pinball expert come up with the game in broad strokes, then have an engineer (or team of engineers) help dial that in. But I want to ask engineers, so....\n\nGenerally speaking, would a pinball champion or a mechanical engineer do a better job of designing a pinball table?",

      "title": "How to Mitigate Cable Snapback for Fuel Depots in Low Earth Orbit?",
      "content": "**Summary**: I'm part of [a lengthy discussion about challenges of in-orbit refueling](https://forum.nasaspaceflight.com/index.php?topic=50157.msg2679316#msg2679316), where I have a proposal for something that involves a pair of fuel depots, massing about 3,000 metric tons each, connected by a cable (presumably 19 mm wire rope) about 6 km long with a maximum of 36 kN of tension on it. Others have raised the objection that if a micrometeoroid strikes the cable it will snap and the snapback will destroy one or both depots. What is a sensible engineering solution to mitigate this problem?\n\n**Details**: One challenge of in-orbit refueling is to settle the cryogenic propellants so the liquid part goes to the bottom of the tanks and the gas (aka \"ullage\") goes to the top. This only requires an acceleration of about 1 mm/s\\^2, but it needs to be sustained for the duration of fueling. We know that SpaceX is planning to use \"ullage burns\" to accomplish this, but that requires venting cold gas or firing a little rocket for extended period of time. \n\nMy proposal was to connect two depots with a cable and let tidal forces do the ullage settling for free. That is, a line from the center of the Earth always passes through both depots and along the cable, so the imbalance between gravity and centrifugal force creates a small tidal acceleration away from the center in both depots. Note that SpaceX already needs to fill two depots, so the extra depot isn't an extra cost.\n\nI've computed that at an orbital height of 287 km (where SpaceX plans to put their depots), if an empty depot has 150 metric tons of mass and a full one has 3000, then the cable needs to be 6 km long to guarantee at least 1 mm/s\\^2 in the full depot. Given that length, maximum tension is when both depots are full and comes to 36 kN. [A single wire rope of 19 mm thickness](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/wire-rope-strength-d_1518.html) should handle this, at a cost of about 35 tons, but, obviously, you'd want more than one cable, give a single hit could sever it. I envisioned three cables in a well-spaced equilateral triangle, since even a very lucky hit wouldn't hit more than two of them at once. Or run more cables to mitigate against *another* hit while you're in the process of replacing the one(s) that got hit. And probably have a regular schedule to replace cables every few years.\n\nThe objection has been raised that the snapback from a severed cable could puncture one or both of the two depots. Searching online, I see lots of concern about snapback, but most of the mitigation seems to revolve around keeping the cable from snapping in the first place. I don't think that's viable in this case.\n\nSo what is the best way to mitigate this risk? Is there anything comparable in terrestrial engineering?",

      "content": "We use overload protections for s-cells. When it bends too far, it contacts the main body of the transducer. They work great. But out of my own curiosity, I'm trying to figure out the reactions once contact is made. Civil engineering stuff online tells me that when the load is over the reaction support, that support takes all the load. This isn't the case, as the whole load cell is bent still. \n\nWhat I think the solution is: \nBack calculate the force needed to bend exactly to contact, and that stays the reaction at the bending end. Any force greater than that is then taken up by the rest of the transducer body. \n\nDoes this compute? I'm sure it's a terrible explanation, but maybe I can get my point across. Please ask for clarification! \n\nIf so, would moment and bending throughout the beam remain the same as if the force was exactly enough to contact? \n\nThanks!",

      "content": "Please correct my likely numerous and embarrassing errors.\n\nFirst, let's look at a carbureted gas engine.\n\nMixture is set with screw adjustments on the carb. Opening or closing the throttle plate does not change the mixture but simply limits how much of the fuel-air mixture reaches the cylinder. Closing the choke increases the proportion of gas in the mixture. (Either through limiting air flow or creating greater vacuum which draws more gas, you tell me) If the mixture is too lean, things could overheat, and if it's too rich, you'll get incomplete combustion and foul the cylinders/plugs.\n\nNow, an injected gas engine still has a throttle plate, so presumably, changing RPM is achieved through both increasing fuel injection and opening the throttle? And mixture can be changed by tweaking one or the other?\n\nBut then diesels don't even have throttle plates. They're always wide open, so how do they even deal with mixture?",

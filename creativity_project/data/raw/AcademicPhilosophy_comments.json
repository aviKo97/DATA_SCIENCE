It should help you retain focus, but even better, it should also help you retain the information because it causes you to read, speak, and hear the words simultaneously.\n\nI’d also suggest working in a designated space that is separate from other living spaces. Try to train your brain to know that when you’re sitting down here, wherever it is, it’s philosophy time now. Maybe that’s a desk instead of your bed or couch. Maybe it’s the library. Maybe it’s some random, hidden, quiet spot on campus (I always loved finding those).\n\nSome other practical things that help: exercise, coffee, getting as much sleep as possible, and napping. I used to get so sleepy in the late afternoon when sitting down to read/write. If I could take a little reboot nap (maybe minimally only dozing off for a few minutes, but otherwise closing my eyes and blocking out the light, and shutting off my brain) it made a huge difference. Then a cup of coffee and I was ready to get back to it.\n\nExercise is great for resetting focus too. Highly recommend trying to keep that a staple of your weekly schedule. Academics can overwork the brain and balancing it out by working your body seems to be very helpful.",

One thing that has helped me a bit is having at least some semblance of a daily routine (though this is not by itself a total cure). I find that it's harder to focus when my days are not regulated in some way, which was made evident to me when I realized that I worked better on days that I had class and really struggled to focus and even start work on days that I had nothing scheduled. So, maybe reflect on what sorts of conditions have been most optimal for you in the past, and try to recreate those situations with regularity.\n\nI saw some mentions of coffee and I just want to add the precaution that \\*perhaps\\* (although not likely), coffee could make brain fog worse if you're prone to anxiety, especially if consumed on an empty enough stomach.\n\nAlso, social support can go a long way when struggling mentally. Therapy can be great if you have the resources for it. Perhaps there are supportive faculty members you can speak to who have gone through the same or similar struggles and learned different ways of adapting. Also, the other students in your program could be experiencing similar issues, so it might be nice to connect and help each other (on that note, sometimes working alongside others helps, or talking about ideas if you're having trouble writing).",

Only in the former can we claim 100% certainty, since such systems are built from axioms and their consequences. \n\nKnowledge isn't certain even in cases like mathematics. Think about the math tests you took in school, and how often you got the wrong answer. Something being deductive and theoretically certain, does not make it certain in practice. It is always possible to make a mistake.\n\n(I remember in calculus classes in college, where tests were often one question, that took the entire class period to solve, one was not expected to get the right answer, because a simple mistake at any point in the long chain of processes needed to calculate the answer, would likely result in a wrong answer. One needed to show one's work, so that the teacher could know if one understood how to do the problem, even if one got the wrong answer. Typically, a silly mistake early in the process would involve getting an incorrect answer that was wildly different from the correct answer, even though it was only one minor mistake early in the chain of processes necessary to calculate the answer to the question. One could do 99% of the problem perfectly, and have a wildly wrong answer.)",

No profs., admins., or sports staff will be affected.\n\nI wish I could say I'm shocked. Academia has been corporate for many years. And like a corporation, those at to bottom, and the most vulnerable, will always be sacrificed first. The profs. and admins. will always protect themselves first. Taking a small cut in pay or benefits to save the jobs of others is a form of empathy that doesn't exist in their worlds.",

I was lucky enough to go to a grad program afterwards that was transdisiciplinary which luckily addresses many of the issues you raise, paired with addressing real concerns (social justice, ecological devastation etc) rather than hypothetical issues that are either dated or stale. It certainly wasn’t perfect, but it included literature, poetry, myth and the whole narrative mythos you gesture to that is paired with wisdom in its grounded human context. \n\nBut one thing I have learned after the fact, unfortunately a bit late, is that the stances you describe are more ideology than philosophy. This confusion is highlighted when you say “it’s immensely valuable if you use it as a tool rather than a religion”. Aside from this poor characterization of religion, what you are actually referring to is ideology, and philosophy as a tool is exactly what academic philosophy provides. That is why they didn’t want to preach or take a stance, they are afraid of establishing dogma. But it’s very clear that what you were wanting from philosophy is “a way of life” which is exactly the function religion provided in human culture (which in its secularized version is ideology). That is also why literature seems to grasp you, as its the narrative inheritor of our old human mythos. That is something I was able to find in my non mainstream philosophy grad program that was very clearly missing in undergrad where everything is so disengaged and fragmented away. Don’t get my wrong, I am not recommending religion, even though Phil of religion was a primary study of mine. But I am gesturing to the human function it provided throughout history, and how it’s inheritors are still strongly ingrained in human culture, which I don’t take to be a bad thing. \n\nBut aside from that nitpicking, I very much resonate with your journey. It was music, poetry and comparative religion that originally brought me to philosophy in undergrad, but I had a similar reaction to academic philosophy. But that journey did bring me to a program that repaired some of those wounds. Your call to action is exactly the type of motivation that can bring people to philosophy, but they are often far more complex and deep for just a single discipline (philosophy) to tackle on its own. But as soon as we stand “for” something - as noble as it is to stand for democracy - we do transgress philosophy as an analytic tool in order to take a very culturally contextual stand for some mythos. I don’t think that is a bad thing of course, but I do think it is more than philosophy has the capacity for. It requires the whole of the humanities and understanding cultural evolution and the elements at play to discern. Part of what you are reacting to is very clearly the analytic tradition of philosophy, as the continental side (as dubious as those terms may be) was very much inspired by the romantics, their literature and this exact centering of the subject as a political agent even before a “disinterested observer”. \n\nAnd I can even see it in your writing. You are writing as inspired, not in analytical format. Not moved by logos alone but discovering how your personal mythos floats along a larger cultural mythos. Which is exactly why the other disciplines in the humanities are integral to philosophy as a love of wisdom and not just a love of intellect. \n\nI hope my communication lands as intended, for I do understand and have been on a very similar journey (in the Bay Area no less). It’s all in good faith as someone who has found some answers (suitable to my psychology) to this gnawing problem of academic philosophy. Only after time and a lucky find in a program that addressed these concerns to whatever degree. There is much more to philosophy (and humans) than the analytical tradition as staunchly entrenched it is in our American world view. And I am happy to hear you have found an empowerment in reading other people’s mythos and its effects upon your psyche (or your personal mythos). You certainly aren’t alone, and I’ve been privileged to see non-mainstream pockets of communities (or individuals) that are doing exactly what you are calling for.",

        "body": "While I generally agree with you; I get the feeling that your impressions are somewhat skewed.  The field has undergone a massive practical shift in the last 20 years, especially since 2020.  Tons and tons of philosophers are preaching, and preaching hard.  I was trained in a fairly technical field but I now teach directly on social issues all the time, so do many of my colleagues. You don't appear to have been assigned many of us to read, but that's often life at a \"top\" school.  \n\nBut of course academics are preaching to each other at academic conferences and in journals; that's where their professional activity takes place.  You're right that this means that they are severely disconnected from the rest of social reality, and this is in large part because of their socioeconomic position and the institutional constraints they are under.  More on this in a second.\n\nAnother thing you should question is your view, implicit throughout the whole post, that philosophical critique is actually what makes social change happen.  That if the whole field of anglo philosophy got together and published critique in the most visible places possible, that Trump's agenda would be affected one bit.  Words aren't magic, but people who trade in words and symbols love to think that they are.  Lots of people in the field have been shouting \"**authoritarian!  fascist!\"** for *years* now in public venues.  So a major question to you is: what should philosophers *qua philosophers* do in order to make this social difference you desire?\n\nFinally, we should all acknowledge that the 'practical turn' in recent years has been almost entirely from a generally left-wing political perspective, and that it has been heavily focused on the 'identity' stuff over and above the economic-justice stuff.  Many people have argued that this has only fed the groundswell of resentment that has led to Trump.  We are extremely socially disconnected people who have very boutique/elite lifestyle preferences and when it comes time to do politics we mainly preach about identity and not about the issues that matter most to the electorate more generally, which [mainly involve the economy, crime, immigration, and educational choice/parental rights](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2024/09/09/issues-and-the-2024-election/).  Step 1 in addressing your final concerns might be a kind of philosophy that *begins* with the questions that concern ordinary people, and which doesn't reflexively cast aspersions on the answers they find compelling.",

My marks were exceptional. My letter writers assured me I’d get in somewhere and that they wrote glowing recommendations. My colleagues think I’m an excellent teacher. And… none of that matters. It’s a crap shoot. Contemporary academia doesn’t have the balls to honestly pursue truth and risk something. My own honesty and baring my soul in my life and application materials has only hurt me.  \n\nSo, here I stand, likely about to be shut out for a fourth time. But it was never about succeeding in the system: it was about doing what I loved. The problem is, due to bureaucracy, closed-mindedness, ideological possession, and other factors, it’s becoming less and less enjoyable. This system won’t last; this system shouldn’t last.  \n\n\nI have no desire to contribute to a system that doesn’t foster open and honest inquiry, but I want to investigate and talk about this stuff. I have no desire to become an article-writing machine who needs to cater to apathetic and entitled students, but I want to teach and introduce the ideas that have changed my life to others for human betterment.  \n\nSo, what will I do? I will write. I will converse with others. I will think, and I will live. And maybe, just maybe, I’ll be able to thrive. I’m not betting on it economically or socially, but I’m not worried. There’s just nothing else I want to do — nothing else I can do in good-faith. I will continue to beat my head against this wall.  \n\nGood luck out there.",

His metaphysical framework in Process and Reality aims to articulate the underlying principles of reality that account for creativity, becoming, and the interconnectedness of all events. His notion of creativity as the ultimate ground and principle of all actuality suggests something that cannot be fully objectified or systematized but instead serves as the dynamic source of novelty and process.\n\nSo I think you may be mischaracterizing Whitehead’s project. While Whitehead employs systematic thought, his philosophy is deeply attuned to what lies beyond direct conceptualization—namely, the immanent yet unobjectifiable nature of creativity as the “principle of novelty” that animates all becoming. This actually parallels your description of something that “cannot be directly described” but manifests through questioning. So based on my understanding of Whitehead, he’s already doing this. \n\nWhitehead’s metaphysics does not seek to enclose creativity within a static framework but instead emphasizes its irreducibility and role as a condition of possibility for all processes. Far from reducing creativity to a fixed system, Whitehead acknowledges its ineffable quality while engaging it through speculative thought. And God and eternal objects enable the manifestation of creativity, and by extension, speculative thought, by providing structure and order without constraining novelty. Eternal objects offer the range of possibilities, and God provides a guiding principle that ensures coherence in the actualization of those possibilities.",

So natural languages (vernacular languages like English) hide the real aspects of the world. By the way, if you claim that logic is a priori, with this kind of picture theory of meaning you have that in some way metaphysics can be done a priori too. \n\nThen, there is a clear idea that something cannot be described by language. The mystical part of Wittgenstein, which is very different from the position of the positivists.\n\nAnother difference with other thinkers is that W follows his theory of meaning even when its consequences seem absurd.

Statements / thoughts are true when they share an underlying logical structure with the states of affairs in the world that they are intended to model.\n\nWhat was new in the *Tractatus* is the use of the then newly invented tools of symbolic logic. This allowed for [new, technical arguments and counterarguments](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-atomism/#FirPhaColExcPro)  different than e.g. Kant’s critique of Hume.\n\nArguably the divide between analytic and continental philosophy begins with this attempt to fuse sophisticated symbolic logic tools with a fundamentally simplistic theory of meaning.

James Pustejovsky uses the 4 aitias as the qualia structure of words. \n\nTake polysemy of words like book/poem or city/country. The qualia structure of book is:\n\n1) Form: the books informational content. \n\n2) Constitution: physical pages or pdf or glossy plastic pages.\n\n3) Telic: provide entertainment or decimate information. \n\n4) Agent: the authors.

Being in academia means giving up any semblence of work-life balance, and that was not something I could handle. \n\nNone of this is to disuade you from studying philosophy.

What are the main ideas of Neo-Carnapians?\n\nOne of the big ones is ontological deflationism. Carnap had a deflationary and pragmatic approach to ontological questions, viewing them as either trivially answered by science (if they're internal to a theoretical framework) or unanswerable (if they're external to a framework). The latter prompts pragmatic questions about the choice of a framework. This is, as I understand it, the basis for Thomasson's *Ontology Made Easy*, a very influential neo-carnapian metaontology. \n\n> If Quine really is receiving a pushback, is that primarily by Neo-Carnapians? or rather by ultra-metaphysical realists?\n\nThe critics I'm familiar with are the neo-aristotelians, like Jonathan Schaffer, Kit Fine and Kathrin Koslicki. Schaffer's *On What Grounds What* is a direct response to Quine's *On What There Is* and contains some of the most common criticisms of Quine's metaontology: objecting to parsimony as the ultimate metaontological value, to this narrow construal of the ontological question, etc. \n\n> What's the overall status of Carnap and Quine in contemporary academic philosophy?\n\nI'd say Quine is still very influential, his views just aren't seen as the default anymore. He's still widely read and respected, and he has a permanent spot in the curriculum of anyone teaching analytic metaphysics. Carnap, on the other hand, is not completely rehabilitated but definitely on his way. In the past, he was often thrown out with the bathwater of logical empiricism, and that has been changing as the legacy of positivism itself is being reevaluated.",

Other researchers in your department won’t be able to vouch for you or speak to other researchers (e.g., potentially those working for reputable journals or other research programs/institutions).

You (unfortunately—or fortunately, depending on how you see it) have to build up a reputation for yourself. This is done most easily when you are with either an institution or a program that is not only recognised in your field but also respected. It’s much more difficult for your work to be criticised if people don’t know it’s there!

I think my background works for the purposes of these questions (since they’re not specifically about an academic career), but please keep that in mind:\n\n1. Loans:\n\nIf you take out significant loans for your undergraduate degree, it will make going straight to law school much harder—and, honestly, you probably shouldn’t want to do this anyway. Law school is expensive, and combining that with undergraduate debt can easily amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars. If possible, avoid taking out loans for undergrad. Law schools, unlike graduate programs in Philosophy, don’t place emphasis on the prestige of your undergraduate institution.\n\n2. The accessibility of philosophy:\n\nWhile I haven’t left school yet, I’ve heard it can be difficult for some to re-enter once they do. It’s worth noting that many people who pursue philosophy come from disproportionately wealthy backgrounds. This ties into my next point (success in law school admissions), but it also reflects the fact that philosophy, in some respects, can be inaccessible. That said, if you’re curious, I recommend starting with an introductory book on philosophy. If you find it interesting, you should pursue it further.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy [Knowledge, Reality, and Value](https://www.amazon.com/Knowledge-Reality-Value-Mostly-Philosophy/dp/B091F5QTDS) by Michael Huemer (despite having little in common with him philosophically). He’s a witty and engaging writer.\n\n3. Philosophy as a pre-law degree:\n\nFormal logic and reasoning can also help with things like the LSAT. But these skills don’t *always* translate to the test directly. \n\nPhilosophy is touted as a strong pre-law degree because it encourages thinking about a broad range of considerations—abstract, practical, ideal, etc. But many other humanities degrees—like History or English Literature—require similar levels of abstraction, reading comprehension, and critical thinking. \n\nI believe you develop these skills, at least in part, by studying a subject you’re truly passionate about. Loving what you study will make you a better lawyer and person, as I’ve found through my philosophy education.\n\nI hope this is somewhat helpful! Best of luck!",

I also come from a working class background, had not read very much before starting, and had god awful grades in high school. Despite all of that I graduated with a 4.0 in philosophy.\n\nBefore starting, I had the same concerns as you and would very often seek out Reddit posts like this one to find encouragement.\n\nYes, you can do it. Start now though. Start watching videos about philosophy, reading intro texts, and poking around the SEP ( https://plato.stanford.edu). My intro philosophy class used the textbook “Does the Center Hold?”. It’s easy and enjoyable to read. It has little pictures which makes it feel less stuffy. The you can move on to reading some of the easier primary texts to get your feel wet. I think that this is when it really clicked for me that “wow, I can actually do this.” I’d start with something like Descartes’ meditations. Use the SEP and YouTube videos from people like Gregory Sadler to guide you through it.\n\nOk, now to address your there’s points directly:\n\n1) I was able to get a lot of aid because I also was very poor during the time I was pursuing my degree. \n\n2) as I mentioned before, I was a bad student in high school. Getting back into writing and reading was a little challenging at first. But you get it back very quickly.\n\n3) for me, I think it was my obsession with philosophy.

I'm now pursuing a PhD in philosophy cause I love this discipline.\n\n1. If you're stateside, check to see if your state has programs to defray costs for older students. Keeping loans low is important, so even at the law school level look for scholarships. But, having a BA will open doors even if you change your mind on law school. Your plan to do CC and then move onto a 4-year is great.\n\n\n2. Not a late 20s returner, but did return post-TBI. Writing is a skill. You'll struggle, get better, get worse, get better, and so forth. I've gotten better at writing since I came back to school, and didn't really struggle to sit down and write. Mostly, there's a joy to being able to do something other people can take for granted. Your instructors want you to learn how to write, because they have to read the papers you turn in. \n\n\n3. Philosophy is *hard*. But any skill worth learning is hard. But hard doesn't mean impossible. Good teachers and being ready to learn to think philosophically helps. And thinking philosophically is a skill, so it'll get easier as you go. If you're struggling, go to office hours and talk to others in your department. Philosophy is dialogical, so talking with others is a good skill (and the sort of thing that makes for good lawyers).\n\n\nI recommend practicing reading for long periods of time. Even starting with fiction is helpful. The only difference between how a philosopher reads is that philosophers just ask a button load of questions about the text. So, once you're reading, make sure your actively reading (let me know if you're interested in what that looks like). Listen to videos and podcasts and then pursue the ideas that interest you via longer books and articles. Then write about those ideas if you want to practice writing.\n If you're interested in more resources let me know.\n\n\nPhilosophy is broadly broken down into 4 categories: value, metaphysics, logic, and epistemology. There's overlap and these are rough groupings. Because philosophy asks fundamental questions about everything,  there's a philosophy of X for anything you're interested in. If you want to learn more about any of these or a philosophy of x, let me know.\n\n\nHere's the basic approach to philosophy:\n\n1. Ask a question.\n2. Figure out what people think is an answer to that question.\n3. Critique those answers.\n4. Hopefully, figure out what you think. \n5. These steps can go in any order. \n\n\nI love this field, and statistically, we do well in mid and lifetime earnings. If you want to go to law school, then study whatever the fuck you want. GPA, LSAT, and LORs matter more than the major. Being able to read and write helps, but several fields teach that skill.",

Like an example where you are asked something, and you don't understand what you are supposed to do.\n\nAnyway, I don't agree with those who say that philosophy isn't about pursuing truth. There is progress in philosophy! However, they have a point in that learning to *do* philosophy as a beginner, is focused more on learning to *analyse* arguments and *arguing for* some position than on successfully arriving at some undeniable conclusion.\n\nAs you have observed, philosophy is not about regurgitating sets of facts, such as what is stated in the law, or who said what when. That being said, facts *are* important. Your arguments must make contact with the world, and facts are often where such contact is made. For instance, factual statements can be used as premises.\n\nThere are good and there are bad arguments. The rules of argumentation are investigated in the fields of formal logic and argumentation analysis. However, while both should certainly be studied, they pose a danger in that they (especially logic, in this application) are highly idealised. It is easy to get scared off by the formalism, or to find oneself incapacitated by performance anxiety when one realises how hard it is to construct a deductively valid argument.\n\nMany excellent students find themselves crippled by the fact that philosophy is about *doing*, about fighting for beliefs, proving statements, and questioning the literature. It is a radical departure from how many subjects are taught. Philosophy is a craft, and like in any craft a good performance comes from practice.\n\nThe most important thing is: get that practice. Read the assigned literature several times. First, a cursory read, to identify the overarching structure and the main points. Then, a close reading, where you reconstruct the argument and make sure that you understand it. Finally, go through it again and identify weak points, try to come up with counter arguments, or try to strengthen it where possible. When you write your submissions, don't just write what the authors you're reading say, *explain why you think that they are right or wrong*. Give reasons for your belief, i.e. *argue* for it. Remember to always read your opponent charitably, and present the strongest version of their argument that you can conceive of.\n\nDon't be afraid of being wrong, try to have fun, and see if you can find some positions you identify with. If not, it doesn't matter. It will come in time.\n\nAlso, check out:\nhttp://www.jimpryor.net/teaching/guidelines/writing.html\n\nhttp://vargasphilosophy.com/Handouts/Howtowrite.pdf",

But there’s also studying philosophy qua the activity of doing philosophy. And insofar as you’re doing that, you’re trying to understand both the arguments and develop your own, according to some strategy you generally offer some sort of justification for. In all of this of course it matters whether what is being said is right/wrong/correct/true.

While it is the search for a truth of sorts, remember that people can use philosophical concepts to make anything seem NOT true, so also study up on your [logical fallacies](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/). That'll also help you start to point out weak arguments someone will try to throw at you.\n\nAlso - start basic. Take an argument from your reading, then come up with your initial response. Don't think about it too much, just say it out loud. Your brain will begin to fight with you about whether you're 100% sure of your answer. Take those contrarian thoughts and say them out loud or write them down.\n\nThis is a fun way I've learned to discover multiple arguments so I could be more prepared in discussion.

Fortunately, most of the giants in legal philosophy (e.g., Fuller, Hart, Dworkin, Raz) are relatively clear writers even if their ideas aren't always easy to follow (yes, Dworkin, I'm looking at you). A lot of the problem has to do with their inconsistent use of similar-sounding terms (e.g., freedom, liberty, right) in a way they aren't often aware of. I know it's a lot, but I'd recommend becoming familiar with the work of Hohfeld to help you more clearly parse terms like \"rights\" and \"duties\", which, in turn, will help you understand what you're reading more clearly. \n\nIf you tell me a bit more about what your professor is assigning, I can give you better suggestions about how to approach the material.",

Then a number of folks went on to short coding \"boot camps\" and did exceptionally well because of their experience in formal logic and semantics, and went on to great programming jobs.\n\nAfter I finished the PhD I couldn't stand the thought of one more day of school, so I did a full-court-press to land a job in corporate strategy consulting. It was not easy. A lot of networking and \"coffee chats,\" a ton of case prep, reading a lot of business primers ... I had a spreadsheet and think I applied to like 112 jobs over six months. I interviewed with all the MBB firms (no offers) but landed at a second-tier firm that ended up being a great fit (and a great paycheck) where I stayed for five years.\n\nIt was a tough path to carve, way more difficult than if I'd gotten an MBA then tried to get into consulting. BUT, once I landed the job, I was promoted quickly and felt like I had a serious edge over colleagues who had MBAs or STEM degrees. I think I was much better at looking at a bunch of messy data and information from disparate sources, and condensing it into a logical narrative/argument for clients ... whereas some of my STEM colleagues could run regression models all day but then not be able to articulate in plain English what it meant for the client's business problem.\n\nSo, in short, I don't regret studying philosophy. It taught me how to disambiguate and solve problems in a structured way. And I loved my grad school experience and the totally brilliant people I got to hang out with for 5+ years.",

Do you agree with these opinions?\n\nYou need to elaborate. I would not recommend it as a direct route to a good income, if that is what you are asking.\n\nIf you are independently wealthy and enjoy philosophy, then it is a fine choice for a major, since you have no need of making money from it, and don't need to concern yourself with the cost of the degree.\n\n\n\n>Do you regret studying philosophy academically and getting a degree, masters, or doctorate in it? \n\nThis is a repeat of your title question, and has the same answer as before.\n\n\n\n>Did you study something after philosophy? \n\nNot formally. So, depending on exactly what you mean by the question, \"no.\"\n\n\n\n>Are there any feasible future prospects for aspiring philosophy students? \n\nYes, though they are not what many philosophy students want. If you mean a BA (or the equivalent), then one might go to law school afterwards. So that one becomes a lawyer. If someone wants to be a lawyer, this is a reasonable approach. But that suggestion is not helpful for people who don't want to get into law.\n\nIf you mean, is there a good prospect in the field of philosophy, I would say no, not in the current situation. There are few decent jobs in academia, as colleges and universities eliminate full-time, tenured positions. If you want to live in squalor, with poor pay, no job security, and no health insurance, you can become an adjunct philosophy instructor at some college (with an MA or PhD in philosophy). I would strongly advise against pursuing that.\n\n  \nThe claims that some make about the abilities of philosophy majors, need to be examined more carefully than many bother doing. Some say that philosophy majors are better at certain things. The question one should ask about that is, is it because of studying philosophy, or is it because the people who are good at those things are more likely to study philosophy? To find out, people would need to be tested before and after their studies, as it may well be that people with certain abilities prefer certain majors, rather than the major having an effect on the students' abilities.",

Different historians see themselves doing different things, and it's far from clear what the \"right\" approach should be. Regarding the aims of the history of philosophy, there are roughly two camps. \n\nIn the first camp there are the \"contextualists\". These individuals more or less fit the mold that I think you are describing. They see their task as more or less something like intellectual archaeology. Their exegetical work seeks to arrive at interpretations of the text that best fit the intellectual context at the time the work was published.\n\nIn the second camp there are the \"appropriationists\". These historians believe that doing history of philosophy involves bringing historical figures into contemporary philosophical discourse. As such, they will interpret historical works in such a way as to make suitable for debates had by contemporary philosophers.\n\nThe existence of the second camp shows that the history of philosophy is not exclusively \"exegetical\", if by \"exegetical\" we mean something like \"interpreting text in such a way that fits with the context in which it was produced\". \n\nFor more on these two camps, I recommend  you read *Philosophy and Its History: Aims and Methods in the Study of Early Modern Philosophy*, edited by Mogens Laerke, Justin E.

And the inclusion, of say subaltern non-speakers/writers (ala Spivak), means at points the archive literally does not exist in different instances.\n\nHistorical interpretation or exegesis, then, requires nominal forms of creativity and decisions of what 'counts' as evidence, and further what to do in the absence of evidence.\n\nOne thinker who does great work on this account is Reinhart Koselleck.

Sometimes this realisation is a reason for doubting my intuitions, but it's so pervasive as to be practically inescapable. I see my atheism as part of a continuity with the Christian tradition and the pre-christian religions that fed into the development of Christianity. I have more of an interest in the history of religion and religious thoughts than I previously had.\n\n\n2) I now see the Catholic tradition I was raised in not so much as silly but as actively harmful.

I have slightly more tolerance for more Protestant sects, but I still think a lot of the harmful ideas go back to Jesus.\n\n\nEDIT: Sorry. Just properly processed the title of this thread.

While I understand this is kind of the point of philosophy,** it leaves me very unsatisfied, and it makes me feel like I haven't really learned anything from my classes. \n\nI very much disagree with this. That may be a fashionable opinion among some academic philosophers, but pretty much all of the great philosophers took definite positions on things, and were not total skeptics who believed that no knowledge is possible.\n\nThe fact that people give counterarguments to positions does not mean that those counterarguments are sound. There are a lot of fallacious arguments that people present. Presenting an argument does not necessarily mean that anything is established with it. With certain kinds of positions, many people have a very strong emotional attachment to their position, and so no reasoning will get them to change. They will continue to come up with counterarguments to try to shore up their position, no matter what evidence and reasoning has been presented. I won't give any examples presently, as then this could be sidetracked into an argument about what positions are right and what positions are wrong. The point I am making is that not all positions are equal, and it is foolish to pretend that they are.\n\n\n\n>My main question is: How do I remedy these problems and become interested in philosophy again? \n\n  \nPerhaps you cannot. I would, however, suggest that you start by recognizing the fact that not all arguments are equal, and the fact that there is always going to be someone arguing against a position is not a reason to reject  it. Bad arguments prove nothing.\n\n\n\n>Should I just jump ship and abandon philosophy because my problems are irreconcilable? \n\nYou have not given enough information to be able to properly answer that question.\n\nIf you have no interest in pursuing philosophy, and if you persist in that, then doing something else would be advisable. However, we cannot know that you will persist in that attitude, and so we cannot say whether this is a temporary issue or a permanent one for you.\n\nIf it is convenient to take a break from it and do something else for a while, that might be a good idea. However, most people do not have the luxury of being able to just put their life on hold and come back to things later if they decide that that is best. If you are like most people in that regard, then you, unfortunately, need to come to a decision sooner than would be ideal.\n\nAlso, if you want more specific advice on what to do, you would need to provide a great deal more information than you have. You say:\n\n>after studying philosophy for 4 years\n\nDo you mean that you have a bachelor's degree in philosophy? Or do you mean you are in your fourth year of getting a bachelor's degree (so you have not been studying it for a full four years yet)? Or do you mean something else?\n\nNot knowing your situation in life, it is impossible to give you very specific advice about what course of action would likely be best for you.",

This was one of the first editions to abandon the approach of attempting to reconstruct the order of the notes originally intended by Pascal and to classify and organize the Pensées thematically. This was actually intended to be more accessible to readers and at the same time make the arrangement less interpretative. So if you find that you often make big jumps, perhaps you are using a different edition. However, even in an edition that works with a thematic classification, reading the Pensées will of course still involve searching for cross-connections between thoughts and thus jumping back and forth.\n\nIn the introduction to the Brunschvigc edition of the Pensées et Opuscules there are remarks on the composition, publication and editions (french): [https://archive.org/details/pensees-et-opuscules/page/806/mode/2up](https://archive.org/details/pensees-et-opuscules/page/806/mode/2up)\n\nThe introduction to vol. 12 of the Œuvres de Blaise Pascal by Brunschvicg seem to cover the original manuscripts and the classification as well.\n\nFurther detailed information on the editorial history of the Pensées you can find here (french): [https://www.penseesdepascal.fr/General/Ed-modernes.php](https://www.penseesdepascal.fr/General/Ed-modernes.php)\n\nA critical reflection on Brunschvigcs work as editor of the Pensées is to be found here (french): [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://shs.cairn.info/article/RMM\\_213\\_0321/pdf%3Flang%3Dfr&ved=2ahUKEwjf4p2drOOJAxWqgf0HHXmsKuM4ChAWegQIGRAB&usg=AOvVaw3KKqY-i1WwaDAlK6xbHsIr](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://shs.cairn.info/article/RMM_213_0321/pdf%3Flang%3Dfr&ved=2ahUKEwjf4p2drOOJAxWqgf0HHXmsKuM4ChAWegQIGRAB&usg=AOvVaw3KKqY-i1WwaDAlK6xbHsIr)\n\nI found a 2016 Oxford Doctoral Thesis dealing with the difficulties of editing the Pensées as well: [https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c0a956c5-716d-4884-bf37-34b836f65418/files/med8469df5a8de1d75885ee2a555bd91a&ved=2ahUKEwi-urO-tOOJAxWEgP0HHd1CIasQFnoECB8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw3bVEbDHrmHW4NLIgJQXakf](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:c0a956c5-716d-4884-bf37-34b836f65418/files/med8469df5a8de1d75885ee2a555bd91a&ved=2ahUKEwi-urO-tOOJAxWEgP0HHd1CIasQFnoECB8QAQ&usg=AOvVaw3bVEbDHrmHW4NLIgJQXakf)",

While my mother would have preferred it if I had gone into medicine (like she had) and become a doctor (like she had), she allowed me to decide what I was going to study.  As it turned out, I was most interested in psychology and philosophy, and it turns out that my mother's sister had also studied psychology and philosophy, so she was quite supportive of my interest in studying these things, just as she had been when her sister had been a college student.  My aunt was in a philosophy Ph.D. program and would have finished it, but got sidetracked by family responsibilities to her husband's family, and never finished her Ph.D.  After I did most of the coursework for the psychology major done, I knew that I didn't really want to go further in psychology, as it didn't feel like additional psychology coursework above and beyond an undergraduate psychology degree offered me any skills or perspectives that I really wanted.  I wasn't really interested in the research, clinical, or organizational tracks associated with psychology, so I wasn't really motivated to get a post-graduate degree in psychology.  On the other hand, I was interested in working with concepts and theoretical frameworks and I quickly figured out that coursework in philosophy provided me with opportunities to work with concepts and theoretical frameworks and that it helped me improve the quality of my thinking.  Vocationally speaking, I never did figure out where I fit in.  As an INFP, there were a number of professions that ought to have been a good fit, but I had difficulty thinking of any kind of job which I might be interested in which I could also realistically hope to get.

I also understand your dilemma. I was in that same place at one point : being from economics, and trained mainly in maths and econ, I didn't know how to get into philosophy, or literary and cultural theory. I see how you are more interested in continental philosophy (at least that's where Jordan Peterson draws most of his references from, though his understanding is very muddled — he tries to impress his audience with turns of phrase, 'rhetoric' that is, than by the kind of logical deduction that's expected in philosophy). Also Peterson's many references are from psychoanalysis, mainly Freud and Carl Jung, and not from philosophy per se. As someone's already told you, you might find analytical philosophy easier to get into, but that is much more like pure maths or linguistics than what you think is philosophy (the philosophy you seem to be inclined towards right now is moral philosophy or ethics). But whichever branch of philosophy you might be interested in, the very, very first pre-requisite is understanding logic. Yes, the same logic that is in mathematical logic. You can open any pure maths textbook, be it on Analysis or Abstract Algebra, and there would be a first chapter on elementary logic. Do NOT skip that. I gained far more clarity of thought after taking classes in Real Analysis and Linear Algebra than I could hope for getting in only economics. The same principles of logic apply generally to all subjects. Honestly, you might consider reading Russell's Principia too, for a firm foundation. Anyway, good luck to you!",

Expect every assumption you make (knowingly or unknowingly) to be criticized or brought into your awareness. Expect a lot of comprehension struggle, having to reread certain philosophers because either you havnt learned the use of their terminology or because what you read isn’t relevant yet to your process.\n\nMy general advice is try to specialize if you can. This can be either a certain field (Phil of science, epistemology, ethics) or tackling a certain question (What is the value of belief? What does it mean when someone gains insight? How do we know the limits of human understanding?). Expect that there is more valuable content in each field of interest than you have the time to consume. Recognize that where we are at now culturally, is predicated by what came before. Let go of an expectation to “solve” hard problems (atleast in a way that convinces the majority), let go of viewing things as black or white (open-mindedness is a principle of critical thinking), and don’t expect to be the first to have thought of a certain idea. Chances are, there is someone out there (throughout history) that has already developed the idea or concept you are conceiving of. \n\nRemember that philosophy is an intergenerational dialogue, and its value comes from standing on the shoulders of those that came before. Don’t expect any particular philosopher to have the “correct” view or to be an ethical Saint. \n\nThe worst thing about studying philosophy academically is recognizing how few people out there (in everyday life) are giving you trained or even thoughtful opinions. Most people have great misconceptions about what philosophy, logic, hermeneutics, metaphysics etc, actually are and use them incorrectly constantly.",

So you really learn how to think more deeply and clearly. And you learn how to write better as well. You get lots of writing practice cos you have to write lots of essays. I also learned a lot of world history along the way cos you're often forced to learn the background context in which many philosophical questions arise, e.g., when you study Descartes and the rise of modern philosophy, or when you read the ancient dialogues of Plato.

Since I wasn't interested in the assigned texts or in the essay questions I had to deal with after 7th grade, I mostly avoided English-related coursework as best as I could when I was in college.  But from first hand experience I can tell you that in the philosophy courses I took, I was expected to critically engage with the assigned readings and any other supplementary readings I cited in my essays.   After years of doing this kind of reading and writing, I gradually became more and more adept at systemic thinking (being able to systemically and critically engage with theory, to evaluate it, to modify it, and eventually to create theory).  When you do this kind of thing long enough, you also learn how to ferret out the premises and assumptions behind your thinking and the thinking of other people.  And this enables you to understand your thinking and the thinking of other people.  (FYI I was majored in psychology and philosophy when I was an undergraduate in the 1990s).",

I know those feelings well (aggressively well), and I know they're so insidious and non-responsive to reasons or experiences... But let me just validate you first and foremost. Imposter syndrome sucks, and on some level, I think it's just always there in the background. I've \"made\" it in various ways (got through the PhD in one piece, landed a fairly desirable TT, etc.), and I still spend most of my time waiting to be caught out. So unfortunately, I'm not sure it ever goes completely away if you're the kind of person who's disposed to it.\n\nHonestly, one thing that helped a little was just time and experience. As you get to know more people in the field, make friendships and connections, read more stuff, have more roles of responsibility and authority (like teaching), you'll start to realize, little by little, that you kind of know what you're doing. Someone will mention a book that you're actually familiar with (instead of you just nodding along terrified); someone will give a conference presentation and you'll realize that you have a question from genuine interest and curiosity, and you'll feel empowered to ask it, etc.\n\nTry to go to lots of talks, especially by early career people and other grad students. They'll be nervous sometimes, they'll stumble sometimes, but they'll also be impressive and have neat ideas, and sometimes seeing those two things co-exist in other people can help you recognize their ability to co-exist in yourself.\n\nTake compliments seriously -- God knows this field doesn't give them out lightly. If a professor, a student, a classmate, a fellow conference goer, etc., tells you that your paper is good or that your contribution was helpful, gosh, take that shit and commit it to memory (or put it in a Nice Things file on your computer) and refer to it when you're feeling like a hack.\n\nHere's another thing: practice writing papers. Not just papers, journal articles. Write 'em and read 'em and write 'em some more. Send them into journals so you can get comments and feedback. Read other people's papers when they're still in the early stages, so you can see acutely how other people's learning curves work, too. If you can swing it and your dept is a reasonably hospitable, maybe set up a grad student writing workshop or reading group, just so you can hang out with other people at a similar stage and watch how they work. As long as you remember, of course, that there are so many different ways to work successfully, and that you treat them and yourself with curiosity as opposed to judgment.\n\nHang in there, bud. I know it's all platitudes and at the end of the day, nothing is really 100% going to convince you... But try to be gentle with yourself. I know a decent number of successful philosophers, and so many of them are low-key dummies. ;)",

        "body": "Yes. One thing that has worked recently is not focusing on how everyone else seems to be smart and capable, but noticing things people do/say that, if I did them, I'd beat myself up about doing them. Except when other people do them, it's normal and fine. This highlights that you hold others to different standards than you hold yourself to. \n\n\nExample: last week I had my third talk of the summer. The one prior to this had been my first international conference, so I had been nervous; I was the only grad student on the panel. But that went well. Last week's talk was at a grad conference (at my institution) and I wasn't happy with how it went AT ALL. I was tired because I haven't had a break all summer, had a bereavement, had two viruses, had two short PhD related trips, and am just DONE. So was really scraping the bottom of the barrel, except for that, content-wise, I was most excited about this talk than my previous two. I'm also most interested in this than my other two, and I feel like it's going to be more central to my PhD thesis than the other talks. \n\n\nBut as soon as I started talking (I had the first slot) it felt all wrong. I felt I stumbled over my words, I forgot a bunch of stuff I wanted to say that wasn't on my slides, and didn't want to look at my notes because it would break my flow. I felt flustered and like a total amateur, and although I got great questions and nice feedback, I felt like I totally bombed, and sat wanting to cry afterwards. \n\n\nBut then I watched the talks that followed, and realised that everyone fumbles, everyone's talks are at different stages of development, and everyone presents differently. The person after me, she had her handout on the projector, we all got one, and she mostly read from it. It wasn't engaging (although she communicated well, the lack of slides made it tricky to follow), and I thought her conclusion was wrong, but it was well thought out, and she highlighted a genuine issue. She got a lot of pushback from more experienced members of the audience, but nobody respected her or her position as a PhD student any less. I've also seen one professor present (actually on the same topic 😂) twice at international conferences, with everyone thinking the argument totally doesn't work, and the paper has been rejected from journals twice. Some of the other speakers did exactly the same things I did that I thought made me look flustered and ill-prepared, but when they did it, it didn't appear to me in this way. And these non-spectacular, less than ideal instances are just part of doing a PhD and being an academic. \n\n\nYou go into a PhD from being a novice generalist in philosophy to a novice specialist in one area. It is kind of weird, but it is an ongoing process. I've definitely found that I've lost track/forgotten a lot of foundational stuff that I learned a few years ago, that I haven't been using in recent years. This is one thing that really makes me feel as you describe, and I hear others comment on talks, or chat with others, mentioning stuff that I'm like \"oh crap, I need to return to x/y/z\". So what I do is have a little time for general/reminder reading each week/fortnight, and this also helps my actual work, because it's still practice, and sometimes stuff useful for your PhD focus will crop up. \n\n\nThe other thing: stop thinking about engaging to be insightful or offer something impressive. You've gotten to this point because you can do philosophy, but it sounds like you're actually trying to now do something else -- be impressive. You don't have to ask a question or make a point if you don't have one. And sometimes people who do, even experienced professionals, don't do this well. I see this over and over again at my department's PhD work in progress seminars. There's always two staff (actually decent, nice people) who complicate things, even things outside of their areas of expertise, and it really offers nothing to the speaker. They always sound incredibly smart when they speak, but that's it. \n\n\nIt's also fine to ask someone to remind you about x if you're talking about something you can't quite remember the details of. I've chatted to well-known philosophers about my work, and they do this! There is one particular, very established philosopher who is incredibly successful, but is the nicest person, and engages with everyone from undergrad to professional on equal terms, and is impressive because they are interestED not interestING.  Being interested means that there is stuff you do not know, or that you've forgotten, that you seek to find out or remember, or develop. I was really nervous to chat to this person, but I left our exchange feeling probably the least imposter-syndrome-y than I have with any other philosopher. I actually probably feel most imposter-y when talking to other grad students, or profs who are very very smart, but aren't particularly interested in the positions of others. \n\n\nI hope this helps but it's still a work in progress for me too 😂",

These often only require a 500 word abstract so it isn't a big commitment to submit.\n\nI found that doing grad conferences early on helped in a few ways. First, if you get accepted you will have the opportunity to practice giving a talk in a low stakes environment. Second, you will meet a load of other people who feel exactly the same as you. Third, being brutally honest, you will see some people giving some pretty terrible talks, either because the content isn't any good or because they are bad at delivering it. That's part of the point of a grad conference, and it'll show you where you sit relative to your peers, and hopefully you might realise that everyone is starting out and hasn't nailed the whole thing yet, which allows you not to be so hard on yourself.\n\nIn the second year of my programme I did about 8 conference presentations at a load of different types of conference (including some quite big open subject ones) and I can definitely say it is one of the most important things I did in bridging the gap from feeling like I didn't know what I was doing to feeling like I could hold my own in what is a pretty cut throat environment.",

If someone shows right away that they cannot think and/or communicate effectively, it's not worth your time trying to have a discussion of complex topics (unless they are paying you, like in a university setting).\n\n2)  the argument is already well known and refuted or not widely accepted as valid.  This is pretty common for people with no background in the history of philosophy to think of some idea that they think is amazingly unique, but really it's already been discussed to death.  \n\n3)  the argument is already familiar to everyone from \"pop philosophy\" and more serious philosophers are just tired of it.  If you come saying you think that the world is a big computer simulation run by robots to distract humans while they harvest our energy, people will tell you they are tired of talking about the Matrix.  \n\n4)  the argument is obviously constructed solely to support something that the arguer just *wants* to be true, rather than something unbiased where you arrived at a conclusion naturally.  Of course there will always be some bias in our reasoning, but if you come to someone with an argument for something like why pedophilia is actually OK, they probably won't take you seriously because it will sound like you just want to feel justified in molesting children.\n\n5)  the argument results in some conclusion that is obviously false.  If your argument comes to a conclusion that is false, then you made a mistake in your argument somewhere and someone may not be willing to bother with trying to help you find it.\n\nThese are the main \"reasonable reasons\" I can think of.  Of course there are times when the listener may not be reasonable, such as:  they don't like you personally, they find your conclusion distasteful, they are just a grumpy/conceited person, etc.  It is certainly possible someone might ignore an argument because of some sort of cultural discrimination, but in those cases it is often more based on religious beliefs than merely cultural ones.",

Here are my honest thoughts.\n\n- You are a talented writer and this will give you an advantage over others that aren’t naturally gifted in that area.\n\n- The opening of the article reminds me of many of my students’ papers insofar as it appears to try too hard to sound grandiose and profound. I think you dial that back as you proceed, but my recommendation would be to never go out of your way to attempt to sound poetic and insightful. Opinions will differ, but philosophy is full of people who are ultimately unsure of their intelligence and philosophical skill trying to make sure other people perceive them as intelligent and philosophically skilled (a natural consequence of there being no universal methodology and few concrete methods of determining these things). When the attempt to control appearances becomes too obvious I think it harms more than helps.\n\n- You’ve done a good job of laying out the author’s view and this is generally an important first step toward producing an analytical or argumentative article.\n\n- If you’re wondering where to go from here, I suggest trying to clearly and simply reproduce the essential structure of the author’s argument - leaving out anything unnecessary to get to the conclusion - and then challenging any of the moves made that appear not to follow from previous assumptions (bad logic), or any that appear to rely on falsehoods, omissions, or questionable definitions.\n\n- If you agree with the author, you might find someone else who has challenged some part of the argument and then counter that.\n\n- There are basically three types of argumentative work (as opposed to just expository work as you’ve done here). (1) Positive: provide an independent argument for some conclusion (probably the hardest to do well). (2) Negative: explicate someone else’s argument for some conclusion and then demonstrate its weaknesses (probably the easiest). (3) Defensive: explicate A’s argument for some conclusion, explicate B’s counter argument, and then defend A.\n\nBeing intelligent, deeply interested in philosophical topics, and also a good writer will position you well for success in academic philosophy, so you’re starting strong.

        "body": "Your writing and language is good. I’m always impressed when high schoolers are engaging with philosophy. I can give a few edits that I have received.\n\n1. Change the language from “we are confronted with the works of…” to “I” language. It’s a bad habit amongst philosophers to use “we” language when we know our experience isn’t ubiquitous. I have not confronted the works of X, you have. It tends to obfuscate the position of the author by presenting their opinion as collective. \n\n2. In the second paragraph, second sentence you state what Becker argues. Great! That is akin to your thesis. But, the claim he makes is huge! He is talking about ALL human culture? Is he an anthropologist or sociologist? Has he experienced (or studied) the breadth of human culture or is he taking a few dominant cultures to make assumptions about everyone else? I would either clarify “who” he is (national identity, historical time period etc) so I know where he comes from or specify what data (or methodology) he is using to make his claim. \n\nMy last piece of advice is split and more personal because I did my undergrad in the analytical tradition but my MA was much more transdisciplinary and creative (as you are showcasing). The style of writing you take part in depends on the audience you are trying to reach. The analytical approach is stripped out of flowery language to the most important variables in order to be as clear and precise as possible. The writing is condensed to the most critical points. This is something you learn in entry level logic and (non creative) writing courses that just takes practice. \n\nBut your writing style is more akin to the romantics (the poets or storytellers). Although this style of writing is more accessible to non-philosophers, it is generally not preferred in traditional academia that leans primarily towards the analytical tradition. However, If you choose to continue this style of writing, I have a few tips. \n\n1. Name your positionality. You are not a disembodied voice speaking to the future progeny of humanity. Being clear as to where your subjectivity enters or begins is important for the reader to clearly understand if you are stating something as your opinion or if you are stating your opinion as a collective fact. It’s the difference between “the world is a dangerous place” and “I believe the world is a dangerous place”. Works like the platonic dialogues have this positionally innately by virtue of its format. \n\n2. Be clear on your why and incorporate it explicitly. In this article you are talking about death. Why is this important to you? Are you speaking about this because it’s immediate in your environment or is this some disinterested subject of interest? I would infer this is meaningful to you based on the style of writing, yet you never state your motive or intention. This works great as an intro to an article, but can also be revealed later in your writing. This point also uproots a clearer goal or purpose for your philosophical inquiry, whether it’s because you are arguing against war, or arguing for universal healthcare. Both positions consider death as you have, but you may find that our discourse around death is saturated with politics and cultural differences. You may not want to do political philosophy (no shame in that) but even if you don’t include it in your writing, it’s important to know what social systems your arguments will work for or against. \n\nSorry this was more than I expected. Hope you find it helpful and keep on writing!",

(As with all such advice, think about it, and follow it if you think it would work well for you, and don't if you don't think it will work well for you.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Despite this, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to write chapter 1. \n\nYou do not need to write the paper in order. I suggest writing the main or basic argument first, then add to it. \n\nThis advice also goes well for how to deal with the additional references; write the argument first, then add references along the way later, as you think suitable, after you have written out the basic argument. Presumably, you have read the references (or many of them that you think you will use), so you already know how to shape your argument to deal with whatever objections would be present in them. So write the argument, to get it clear, and then add the references later. You shouldn't get lost in a tangent this way, as the argument is already clearly written.\n\nOr, you could write any part first. Write whatever part you find most convenient to write first.\n\nYou also don't need to worry about whether it will ultimately fit; it is not carved in stone, and can be changed, or a part can be discarded, if it proves unsuitable for the final version. The main thing is to start writing something, that is in the general direction of what you eventually hope to accomplish.\n\nI have rarely written anything in the final order of the finished paper. In fact, I can only think of once that I did that, and that was as an undergraduate, and it was an unusual circumstance for me. It is often best to write introductory remarks after the main part is finished, so they fit precisely what comes later, rather than write something that you expect will fit what you will write later.",

However, straying form the topic can be a real issue.\n\n\nThere are two approaches that can solve this.\n\n\n1.  First, write an outline first. For example, select the authors you are going to discuss, assign them the topic you want to discuss (so you don't get lost), and then an order of presentation. \n\n\nSo, for example, you could go:\nAuthor A, argument A based on text A.\nCriticism of A by author B in text B\nAuthor c, argument B, text C. \ncriticism of C by author A. \n\n\nPay attention to the interconnectedness of the arguments, A should have relation with B, B with C and so on.\n\n\n2. Another approach is to sit down and just write \"naturally\" whatever you want until the review is finished.\n\n\nBoth in 1 and 2, then you will have to edit. the advantage of 1 is that there will be less editing because you planned before. The advantage of 2 is that maybe following a plan interrupts your creative process if you are not used to it, or may result in a more robotic style.\n\n\nFor planning I use OneNote, although I imagine similar programs abound. In one note, I create one tab per chapter, and then in each tab I create one tab with the master plan, and then additional tabs with the literature I'm going to be discussing, and so on. \n\n\nIf you've never written a thesis, the jump from a paper to a thesis can feel daunting. But really a thesis is a collection of papers, with each chapter being a paper, with a literature review paper at the start. ",

Most philosophy texts need at least a second read and this could help. If it’s not readily available, email your profs for the reading list if possible and get a start. Most will appreciate the initiative but not all will reply either way (summer, especially late summer, is often their time off work and some are understandably protective of that.) I doubt any would hold an email against you, but it may or may not have helpful results. \n\n2) if 1) fails, take your class list and read up. Major names, texts, etc. get at least a basic feel for what’s what beforehand. While never curable for a paper (obviously) wiki can actually be quite helpful here. \n\n3) be ready for a lot of- A LOT - of reading. My BA had me reading 2-3,000 pages for my philosophy classes weekly on average, with recomended readings noted. \n\n3) learn to skim read well and focus read when you need to. First read is to skim and focus read is to, well, focus. Especially in continental (which I also focused on), the “point” sometimes comes later than you think and the structure of the argument will be influenced by language and writing fashion of the day. Let yourself skim read, then read deep the second round. Take notes with both, mark on the second read (unless you’re already a decent close reader). \n\nThems be my takes. Best of luck!

Playing and writing music, making art, reading for fun (gasp!), reconnecting with friends, being outdoors, moving my body, eating good food. I realized that when I gave myself permission to *simply be*, I gained clarity about what I considered to be meaningful. That's because I remembered more fully who I was beyond the studious self I'd been presenting.

I encourage you to examine what your priorities are and to give yourself permission to rest. Not rest like \"let's take a quick break before returning to a life of burning out\" because what you're doing now is clearly unsustainable. Instead, find rest that is **restorative** to who you are as a multifaceted person with value, worth, capabilities, quirks, history, and passions. \n\nDo you really want to begin a PhD right away if it means continuing your current personal trajectory? Taking a year off now to recalibrate may set you up for future flourishing (because *you* took time to redefine what a flourishing life means *for yourself*).\n\nFeel free to DM me.

Several reasons; they set you up to publish, and give you the basis for ideas you can tap for the rest of your career. The most important though, in my opinion, is that writing a small book for a highly qualified audience will remold your brain and get you ready for the sorts of large-scale thinking that good scholarship requires.\n\nHowever, there are some pretty notable exceptions to the rule! My favorite example: Straker's \"Kepler's Optics: A Study in the Development of Seventeenth-century Natural Philosophy,\" is regarded as a must-read classic in the history of optical science, and there are serious ongoing debates about its content even 50 years later. It was groundbreaking, and also remains the best way to learn its subject matter. (Reading Kepler's optics on your own can be rough.) So it is possible to write a classic and citable dissertation!  But its also rare enough that Straker's is the only one I can think of off the top of my head.

The author of the dissertation will themself likely prefer that you cite the published thing, rather than the dissertation.\n\nOften, however, there is stuff in a dissertation that you want to reference that isn't (yet) published in a journal article or book.  In this case, I don't see any problem with citing a dissertation.  I've done it in several cases.  It's important to know that the stuff you're referring to is publishable quality, however. \n\nIf you're a philosopher working in the field, it's generally pretty easy to tell whether or not the stuff in a given dissertation is publishable quality.  If you're not, one easy heuristic is just to see if the author of the dissertation has published other related material in good journals.  If they have, that's good reason to think that their work in this field is taken sufficiently seriously that their dissertation can be cited.  If they haven't, that doesn't necessarily mean that it shouldn't be cited, but you should be more cautious in that case--perhaps asking people who work in the field about it.",

You could also say someone like Hayek was influential mostly through influential elite opinions in economics and politics, and arguably less so among the wider public. Freud and Jung were also very influential, although I'm not sure if they would also consider themselves philosophers. Then there's of course philosophy outside of social/political philosophy, which I am less aware of, and it becomes difficult to assess who is or is not a philosopher. \n\nAmong those who I believe would have called themselves, at least partly, philosophers for their influence on both philosophical discussions AND wider society, I'd say Fanon, Rawls, Friedan, Peter Singer, and Wittgenstein. \n\nLastly, I'd also add that \"influential\" does not necessarily mean in a positive way.\n\nEdit: Also, Dewey should be in there, but again it's hard to define how much his influence was as a philosopher vs practioner and researcher of pedagogy.",

In a capitalistic-industrial society, most people have pragmatic or technical concerns, so theory (philosophy and academia) is only useful insomuch that it supports our practical development. That’s also why philosophy and psychology in mainstream culture is reduced to self-help books, podcasts, or influencers. \n\nBut I will say, that the concern about the increasing division between disciplines does have a solution. \n\nMy MA philosophy program was transdisciplinary, which certainly solved many of philosophies relevancies issues. Focusing on actual problems facing humanity like climate change, social injustice, or income inequality instead of the language puzzles analytical philosophy gets stuck on was an important approach to regrounding philosophy in our lived experience. Likewise, a transdisciplinary approach is needed to address many of the complex problems like climate change or the hard problem of consciousness. No one discipline can solve them alone, even science. Philosophy is the foundation of every discipline and it has no direction when siloed off. But philosophy has an innate depth (if you look beyond the surface understanding of the traditions) for cultural inspiration and problem solving that really thrives when in relationship to other disciplines (like ecology, psychology, physics, mathematics, anthropology, cosmology etc). \n\nThe last thing that is important, is that philosophy in its modern expression of the tradition has always been about participating in an intergenerational conversation - books and writings make the largest impact on future generations. Many philosophers don’t live in times where their work has made an impact. Philosophers are akin to planting trees even if they never enjoy the fruits of their labor. \n\nYour finger is on the pulse for sure, but there are alternatives and solutions out there that address these concerns.",

Now, most departments will still have at least one history of philosophy course on early-mid 20th century phenomenology but usually that’s about it (so usually there’s no coverage of continental phil as an active research program, whatever that’d mean precisely). Even as a stand alone history of phil course, it’s highly unusual to have a course in “pop” continental philosophy (existentialism, late 20th century french phil, etc). That said, this might just be a historical contingency of the division of academic labor and departmental boundaries in academia because, at least in the US, you can still run into a class reading with a continental-bent (e.g. Baudrillard, Derrida, etc) it’s just that class is likely gonna be hosted in a department outside the philosophy department (e.g. english, political sci for political theory, comparative literature, literary theory, or even anthropology).",

The biggest caveat is that if you want to be a professor, you'll have to give philosophy 100% and the workload of a double major can make that difficult.\n\nThe consensus these days is that academia is a bloodbath. I'm not going to say you shouldn't try, just that it's good to have multiple backup plans. You're doing yourself a favor by starting to plan early. See how you like philosophy in the context of university, learn about the structure of universities and the path to becoming a professor, and get involved in independent research asap. Go to conferences and office hours, make as many connections as you can. It's worth at least trying pursue your dream, but be aware of other professional doors that may open along the way.\n\nETA: One of the lovely things about philosophy is you can do it independently. Even if a job as an academic philosopher doesn't work out, you can write and publish on your own. That might be a good option if you can find something else to pay the bills that you enjoy well enough.",

A good undergraduate philosophy degree will help you to develop better critical reasoning skills, linear, logical thinking, a decent command of language that will allow you to mean what you say and say what you mean. \n\nI also work in IT as a sys admin and as my studies in philosophy progressed so did my capability to effectively handle my responsibilities in an efficient manner. Lots of what IT has going on for it is Logical, linear thinking where attention to detail (specifically with claims) is of high importance. The end goal for all of us, I think, is simply to live a life where things appear clearer to us than what they once did. \n\nIdea is really the ideal career imo because of how much ingenuity it takes to do some of the more complex work on the cyber security and coding side.",

The best thing you can do is simply buckle down for the long haul. School takes a while, and now it's going to take even longer. You will need to pass those courses, and pass them well. You'll also need to hold a pretty high GPA through the rest of your career (but not every single class. Trust me, there's breathing room). \n\nDon't overload yourself, simply go slow and steady to the end of you academic career and turn your mind toward life long education. If a grad department sees that you are in it for it's own sake and in it for the long haul, then they're much more likely to look past a simple road bump in your academic journey. \n\nI dropped out a long time ago after changing majors several times. I took a 5 year hiatus, got back into philosophy, finished my undergrad in 7 total years and became an office dweller. I was ALWAYS in professors offices getting to know them, asking questions. If they had office hours then I was using them. When it came time to apply for grad school these folks all knew me and my work ethic. I had a pretty big blip in my academic career that might have seemed undesirable but was simply overlooked because they all knew I was here to finish. Whether it took 2 years or 20, they knew they'd get a diploma in my hand eventually. \n\nAnyhoo, take it easy and go at a manageable pace.

Even if it will require more years as an undergraduate it is almost a must. No academic jobs at a University unless you have a PhD and  it may be very difficult still to find a position at a Community College in an area you would want to live even with a PhD. Have an alternate plan. Your intuition after the conference matches mine after I got my MA in Philosophy and pretty much holds to this day .",

Most philosophers who engage with Turing's arguments agree that the \"mathematical objection\" on the basis of Godel's theorems just makes a simple error of assuming that the user of a formal system would be able to recognize a given formal system as being (or not being) the formal system they use. But Penrose has pushed this to the point of arguing that the \"microtubules\" in neurons must be tapping into some heretofore unexplained quantum process that enables the computation of non-computable processes.\n\nThe paper being cited here just differs by taking the computability of quantum processes for granted, rather than using this as evidence of the non-computability of quantum processes.\n\nhttps://scottaaronson.blog/?p=2756",

A school like that would be highly idiosyncratic, and not conducive to a well-rounded philosophical education. A good school need only one or two experts working in your intended field of study to act as advisors. Also, if you haven't even studied philosophy at the graduate level yet, I would question your ability to make informed judgments about which area of research you'll be interested in come time to write a dissertation. Furthermore, philosophy is an extremely pedigree-sensitive field, so getting in to a highly ranked school is important for job prospects (assuming you want to do philosophy professionally).\n\n**In any case, according to PGR, in North America we have:**\\\nUniversity of Miami - Highly Recommended  \nUniversity of Pittsburgh - Highly Recommended  \nUniversity of Toronto - Highly Recommended  \nYork University, Toronto - Highly Recommended  \nUniversity of Calgary - Recommended\n\n**Unranked but worth considering:**\\\nNew School University  \nSouthern Illinois University, Carbondale  \nUniversity of Oregon  \nVanderbilt University\n\nAnother commenter already suggested 2 schools from the second list, but I'd recommend looking at the ranked list first.

If you do get something published, the value to your career and PhD admission prospects could be immense. Now it's probably not healthy that, as a discipline, we're now talking about competing to get stuff published as an undergrad for the sake of your career, but even if that's institutionally unhealthy, the correct strategy for you as an individual is to play the game as effectively as possible.\n5. Don't worry about cluttering the literature with trash. Cynically, this has already happened! Less cynically and more seriously, If you can get your paper past an editor and two reviewers at a decent journal, it's probably worth publishing, even if it's not going to change the world.\n\nThe only thing that makes me hold back from enthusiastically recommending publication is that a senior philosopher told me that it used to be the case in the US that having papers published could actually hurt your job prospects if the hiring committee didn't like the paper. Apparently, for a long time the standard strategy was to not publish until you had a really 'big' paper- targeted at a top-tier journal like Mind or JPhil. This is certainly not the case in Australia, my country, where volume counts for a great deal, and I doubt it's still the case in America, but it might be worth consulting with your supervisor first just in case.\n\nBe aware that if you go down this path you won't just write the paper up for publication once and then go ahead with it. Even if it's on par with Gettier it will probably be rejected initially in the present environment. Don't bother submitting it unless you're willing to try at *least* 4 or so journals.",

I am done with classes for it. \nHere are some tips as a “lazy” (I don’t go above and beyond & feel I spend less time than my peers on it) studier. (This is way longer than I expected) \n\nFirst, I get a feel for the professor and class. Does the professor expect every reading and article thoroughly read? Then, yeah, read them. But, only do one moderate read through before class. If something still isn’t clicking after discussion, go to office hours (seriously! All of mine have been wonderful for extra help). Do they sometimes just add a bunch of extra readings in case you want to do a paper on that topic? Leave those unless you are doing a paper on the topic. \nI’ve had classes where each assigned article must be read thoroughly to keep up in class and exams, some where my only grade was a singular paper so I could focus on my research for that and just show up and listen in class. It all depends on the class. \n\nPapers are my strong suit. I pick a topic of interest, download all I can on it, skim through until I find the right sources, reread and mark up. These sources all keep citing this other guy? Time to read that. Outline what points you want to touch and where (get it organized!). I also usually have a separate doc with notes I’ve made while reading sources, quotes I liked, and rudimentary sketches of what I want to argue that I copy and paste from. Start writing. Not sure what to write for section 2, but have a good argument for section 3? Write section 3 and come back to 2 later. This is the beauty of the organized outline, it helps you keep track and move around. I’ve once sent in a draft and then completely changed my argument for the final submission. Just work on it and let it evolve. Not sure how something is coming off? Send it to a mentor or the professor. Now, I procrastinate, so unless a draft is required, I usually don’t have one done in time to get feedback. But always try to give yourself a day to edit before submitting. I’ve found that I write quickly, but I take forever to read through my sources. I can give myself two days to write a 15-20 page paper, but only if I fully understand all my source material. That takes days in and of itself. \n\nExams: Luckily, my professors have usually given me heads up on what to expect for them. I just revisit notes, mentally (or physically) outline the arguments we went over, how different arguments relate to one another, etc. I just grind it for a couple nights before. If I have a gap in my notes or memory, I revisit the material. For memory, please find things that work for you. I usually have to physically write things down and organize it visually to help recall. (Oh, this point was in x section of my notes! *visualizes that section*) \n\nFor me, just starting is the hard part. Once I do, I remember I love it. Make yourself go to the library with a coffee and just sit there until you start (delete distracting apps from your phone if need be!). I usually go until I find my concentration slipping. I can get hyper fixated/in a “trance” (I’ve forgotten meals) but usually after a couple hours I have to get up, take a walk, eat a snack, etc., before sitting back down. Exercise is great during breaks.",

Graff, The Modern Researcher, 6th ed.\n\nHoward Becker, Writing for Social Scientists, 2nd ed.\n\nWilliam Strunk, Jr. and E.B. White, The Elements of Style, 4th ed.\n\nKate L. Turabian, Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, 8th ed.\n\nPlus, stuff (decided by the professor over the course of the semester) later posted on Canvas:\n\nBooth, The Craft of Argument, \"Revising Your Organization and Argument.\"\n\nOrwell, \"Politics of the English Language.\"\n\nPinker, \"Why Academic Writing Stinks.\"\n\nRoney, \"Postmodernist Prose and George Orwell.\"\n\nSchiappa, \"Professional Development During Your Doctoral Education.\"\n\nToor, \"Goodbye to All That.\"\n\nToor, \"My Little Bag of Writing Tricks.\"\n\nToor, \"The 'So What' Problem.\"\n\nToor, \"Why Bother Writing Book Reviews.\"\n\nThat class was led by someone very hesitant of Critical Theory, hence articles like George Orwell's critique of English language reforms, but even that makes a lot of great points about writing clearly and effectively. I would recommend every grad student, who plans to pursue professional philosophy (or most areas of academia), read every one of them.",

You come up with the general structure, write, revise, and then add citations as your final touch?\n\nASSUMING that's the case, I can see why that someone told you that your method is 'wrong'. 'Not having enough time to write everything' shouldn't be the reason to forgo research. A research paper is literally a paper that reports your research/findings. If you look at most scientific research papers nowadays, no matter how revolutionary their idea might be, they always begin with a literature review. Knowing how to manage time between research/reading and writing is imo an important skill and part of academic writing.\n\nAs for 'forgetting', well, that's a universal problem for every academic. What you can do to help your memory is to take notes when reading. What I do is when I discover notes that I find potentially useful, aside from highlighting I also collect them to a separate databank that I can easily access whenever. I make sure to add the bibliographical information and tag it with easy-to-remember identifiers so I don't have to go around browsing through entire books and articles over and over. It feels tedious at first, but once you have a database up and running, it's so easy to retrieve relevant citations you want via searching for tags instead of randomly searching through books and pdfs.\n\nThere is a growing market and active scene for note-taking apps nowadays that can help you with your research. Check out the Zettelkasten method for an introduction. Hope this helps.",

Much evidence suggests it is the philosophy of Will Kymlicka.\n> \n> Over twenty years ago, the _Wall Street Journal_ called Kymlicka a “global guru” due to his impact on lawmakers around the world, particularly in Europe. Since then, the influence of the Queen’s University philosopher has only grown. When Nepal went through an acrimonious debate about a new constitution, for example, the country’s largest English-language newspaper, the _Kathmandu Post_, editorialized in favour of incorporating Kymlicka’s framework of minority rights.\n> \n> His influence has also been felt in Bolivia, where Indigenous people make up a majority of the population yet are underrepresented in the military, and where Kymlicka was called in to address Bolivia’s president and other dignitaries on how to make the army more inclusive. When the United Nations sponsored a workshop on African multiculturalism in Gaborone, the capital of Botswana, the organizers urged attendees to show up having read books written or edited by Kymlicka. Kymlicka has spoken to audiences at over 100 universities, and his work has been translated into more than thirty languages.\n> \n> Kymlicka’s unprecedented impact is due, in part, to the focus of his work. He has long been centrally concerned with so-called national minorities: groups such as the Quebecois or Indigenous peoples, whose presence within a country’s borders is not the result of immigration but predates the country’s official founding. Policies designed to protect minority cultures have long given rise to the concern that they can disregard the rights of other members of the political community. Rather than embrace one value at the expense of the other, Kymlicka takes the claims of cultural protection _and_ individual freedom equally seriously. In this way, Kymlicka, along with other scholars he has inspired who now build on his work, overcomes challenges to implementing minority rights in a liberal state that were long considered intractable.\n> \n> Kymlicka’s theory has been deeply shaped by Canada’s history as the home of three different national communities, English, French, and Indigenous, living under a common set of laws. Canadian policy makers have had to improvise new solutions to the challenges presented by more than one nation sharing a government. When this improvising has resulted in workable measures, the principles on which those measures are based have not always been immediately clear. Canadian practices of accommodating national minorities, rather, have often come into being before anyone had formulated a well-worked-out theory justifying such practices and outlining what precise form they should take.\n> \n> Kymlicka and other thinkers he has inspired spell out the principles of justice that have informed Canadian practice with clarity and rigour. In this way, his work puts an optimistic spin on Hegel’s image of the owl of Minerva extending its wings slowly at the falling of dusk. Kymlicka has captured Canadian political experience in thought and distilled it into a philosophy of global relevance.",

My suspicion is that one pub in a journal that people have heard of is an absolute necessity to get in the door. The more \"prestiguous\" the journal the better, and I would hazard that a pub in a \"high prestige\" journal like Phil Review is valued *much* more highly than two pubs in good journals like Synthese or Erkenntnis. (I also think this is bad: prestige isn't a reliable enough marker of quality for this kind of disparity.) And beyond a certain point, quantity doesn't help: the number quoted to us was 1 pub from year 4 or 5 in the program on, which seems about right. I know a bunch of people with double (or more) that figure who have struggled to land permenant positions. \n\n> 2) Is someone ABD even competitive for TT positions anymore? \n\nYes. \n\n> Should I even bother with those or focus more on the post-docs? \n\nWell, one, you should talk to your advisor(s). Two, the honest answer here is that you should be focusing on all of them and should have spent the last few months devoting a substantial amount of time to writing your various statements and samples. The job market is a *huge* time suck. \n\n> 3) Is a website really necessary or is it simply a time-wasting vanity project? Will a search committee really be googling me? \n\nIs it *necessary*? Probably not. There are search committees out there that probably won't care. But there are other search committees that absolutely will google you, and I can't remember talking to a single person who got a job in the last decade without a website. \n\nAlso, an up-to-date website is just good practice. You want people to be able to find your work, the easier the better.\n\n> 4) What is a normal number of jobs that people first going on the job market apply for? Should I cast a wide net or focus more on fewer positions that are a better fit? \n\nI think I applied to somewhere around 40 in my first year, even though I had another year of funding available. If I was doing it again, I would have applied to fewer, but that's only becuse I've realized that there are places that I just don't want to live and academia isn't worth it.",

A lot of grad-students/lecturers/professors need to attend conferences as part of their job search, can only afford to go with funding from their institution, and can only get funding if they're presenting a paper. So people will present on topics they may not be ... fully qualified on.\n\nFor that reason, I try to be generous with presentations like this. A lot of folks have to present papers if they ever want a job, and sometimes you don't have anything to present that you feel confident about.\n\nAs for how to question it: Again, the first rule is to be generous with them. With a big mistake like you describe, anyone familiar with the topic realized what they said was ridiculous. They either realize it's subpar work, and all you're doing is creating drama. Or they're not serious about their scholarship and, then, who cares? They don't, and it'll be clear to most of the audience.\n\nThe second thing to do is focus on your own learning. You know they're wrong and you're not going to learn anything from them. At that point, don't worry about it and don't ask any questions. In philosophy, there are a lot of cases where folks disagree about what an author is saying, so it's worth asking a question in those cases. But if you think that they didn't even read the book they're talking about, then you're probably right, you know it, they know it, and at least part of the audience knows it. Demonstrating that to the rest of the audience doesn't accomplish anything and may actually make you look bad (as you realized after your question).\n\nYou may feel like either there's a sense of justice in calling someone out or that you don't want people in the audience to be misinformed. For the later, no one is basing their research on a book review at a grad conference. For the former, I get it, but, again, either they don't care about research and anyone familiar with the topic already knows, so justice has already been served, or they struggled to get something to present, and you're just creating an awkward situation for them.\n\nIt sounds like the presenter you saw was in the \"doesn't care about their own research\" camp. They were wrong, anyone familiar with the topic knew they were wrong, and when called out they doubled down instead of admitting it. That person is unlikely to ever get a job in philosophy, and their degree will just be a resume builder, nothing more. Don't worry about them or what they said.\n\nA related issue, though absolutely not what you did in this case: At every conference, at most panels, there's one person who'll ask a question boiling down to \"Look how much more I know than the presenter.\" Often in the form \"You talk about X, but \\[2 minute aside about their own research\\], what do you think about that?\" Everyone knows what those folks are doing, and it does not endear the questioner to anyone. It's a bad look, and the interlocutor is hurting themselves by asking those questions.",

Anyone telling you that you'll be fine and guaranteeing you'll get a job is lying or deluded. That's not to say that you won't be able to get a job. But the odds are not in your favor. This is nothing against you or your abilities. I don't know you. It's an objective fact about the abysmal job market. Looking back on all the people from my program who have got or not gotten jobs teaching philosophy, the success rate is independent of philosophical ability. What matters is your connections, the topics that you happen to specialize in and whether hiring programs happen to be looking for such specialists while you're on the market, and how many papers you've gotten published while in graduate school (which is largely independent of skill as a philosopher and more so dependent on self-discipline--especially in connection with writing for at least a couple hours everyday--and ability to focus on a narrow topic that you specialize in, day in and day out).\n\nGet a Philosophy PhD because it allows you to study something that you love for at least another 5 years of your life with others who are deeply passionate about similar topics. But also recognize that in terms of career moves, this is potentially a major set back. Not only is the opportunity cost of the time spent on the PhD substantial, but I know plenty of people who have left academia after receiving their PhD who have told me that having the PhD has hurt their ability to get a job in most cases--both because many in charge of hiring/interviewing outside of academy scoff at philosophy/the choice to get a PhD in philosophy and also because they assume that the degree means that you expect a higher salary.\n\nSo, in my view, the best way to try to convince your grandmother is by changing the terms of the debate. Tell her you recognize her concerns and she has good points. But you're young and your goal is to explore something your passionate about. If that's your ultimate goal, you don't need to convince her that getting a PhD will help you succeed in a career, because that's not what you're aiming at in the first place. I don't know your grandmother. She may balk at that, as some have when I told them my reasons for getting my PhD. But it's your life, not hers. Don't let people's indoctrination into capitalism and the perceived need to orient your entire life around a career determine your life.",

These discussions impact each prof’s perspective of each student and also impact where the group “ranks” each student, including their likelihood of completing the degree, winning a job on the market, etc. They may even literally rank you. \n\nThese discussion may also impact where resources are allocated. If a student is deemed to be near the top of the cohort, they may be more likely to get dept. grants, preferred teaching assignments, travel money, etc. as well as more time and support invested from the profs themselves, e.g. reviewing papers, writing letters of rec, and such. The opposite is also true.\n\nSo, it’s early and this isn’t yet a big deal, but my advice is to focus on more than just passing each class if you have higher aspirations than simply completing the degree. Academia is a competitive place and there are many more grads than there are teaching positions. Keep that in mind and try to “play the game” as much as you can stomach, IF you want to “win” and become a tenured professor somewhere that doesn’t suck.",

The difficulty of these readings and the level which you’re expected to engage with the text will vary, and every professor will have a different style. But if at this point you can read and understand 60 pages of assigned reading/week, then I would say you are well-positioned for the jump.",

And unfortunately there isn’t that much advice on what kinds of programs or methods work best for organizing all of the information we need to do our research well. \n\nI was in a similar position a couple of years ago and tried to move past the ordeal of manually typing out highlights and notes that were done on paper. My solution to the problem was to buy an iPad but as a grad student on a grad student stipend, I bought the regular iPad and the accompanying poorly designed accessories. Like you, I never came around to incorporating it into my workflow and found using the iPad to be even more frustrating than relying entirely on hardcopy. The iPad had this headache-inducing glare, the pencil never felt as seamless as pen on paper, the pencil design was also laughably bad, the keyboard attachment was bulky, and the battery was unreliable. \n\nRecently, after several years of being a grad student, I’ve finally figured out what works best for me. I use a Kindle paperwhite to do 95% of my reading. I am able to highlight in there and can download my highlights and notes from the Amazon cloud onto my computer. I use Obsidian for note-taking and that’s made work on my dissertation much easier than when I was using a tangled mess of paper notes and notes written in books. There is this other software, Readwise, which syncs Kindle notes with Obsidian, but it costs some money every month use so I haven’t tried it out. I, of course, do all of my writing from a computer but I find having a device for reading only, like a Kindle, kind of replicates the mood and focus one has when reading physical copies of books. \n\nIt took me a while to get to a place where I’ve found what works for me but it’s a lot of trial and error that helps you realize what helps or prevents you from doing your work well. I also recommend looking into the ‘personal knowledge management’ literature since a lot of other knowledge workers have to organize large amounts of information and research in order to do their work. \n\n(Also, best of luck on starting your PhD!)",

I have little sticky tabs that I use to mark particular passages in the book. I type up notes in OneNote, but if I have a passage marked, I often don’t totally reproduce it. I mostly type up a summary with enough keywords that it’ll pop up in a search, page numbers that will direct me to relevant passages, and my own thoughts/responses. So I’m not taking time to type up the whole book. If I need a direct quote, I can go back to the physical text fairly easily. I think it’s actually forced me to take better notes because I’m more actively engaging the content. I can think about larger structures for the arguments without getting bogged down in the details, but if I need the details later I’ve left myself a breadcrumb trail. \nSo I’ve taken a different attitude towards my physical books and how I take notes from them compared to digital sources, but with the long game in mind.

It's conservative in that holds that prescriptions should be sensitive to existing social conditions, thereby referring back to what came before. In contrast, Rawlsian liberalism has a kind of \"cleaning the slate\" view of how to proceed, which is in some ways anti-conservative. But I think the view of MacIntyre, if fit into a modern progressive lens, would say that true material progress cannot be achieved by cleaning the slate in the Rawlsian way.\n\nI've read some Sandel and he did come across to me as economically conservative (e.g., relative to Marxists), FWIW.

And, where liberalism by permissive legal enactments has tried to use the power of the modern state to transform social relationships, conservatism by prohibitive legal enactments now tries to use that same power for its own coercive purposes. Such conservatism is as alien to the projects of *After Virtue* as liberalism is. And the figure cut by present day conservative moralists, with their inflated and self-righteous unironic rhetoric, should be set alongside those figures whom I identified in Chapter 3 of *After Virtue* as notable characters in the cultural dramas of modernity, that of the therapist, who has in the last twenty years become bemused by biochemical discoveries, that of the corporate manager, who is now mouthing formulas that she or he learned in a course in business ethics, while still trying to justify her or his pretensions to expertise, and that of the aesthete, who is presently emerging from a devotion to conceptual art.

Here are some examples of books that a little more interesting from a general perspective, though I can't say they are anything on a par with the classics.\n\nL.A. Paul: *Transformative Experience*\n\nKieran Setiya: *Midlife: A Philosophical Guide*\n\nMartha Nussbaum: *Justice for Animals*\n\nTommie Shelby: *The Idea of Prison Abolition*\n\nDavid Chalmers: *Reality+*\n\nThis is a pretty hodgepodge list though.",

Most colleges these days hire adjunct (part-time) instructors with little to no benefits at very poor pay, for as many classes as they can. And such positions tend to be hired one term at a time, so there is no job security at all. They simply don't hire you next semester if they don't need you or don't want you. Since you are hired one term at a time, they don't need a reason to get rid of you at the end of any term. Also, even if they do offer you some classes the next term, it may be fewer than you had the previous term, so there is no guarantee of even the poor income you might have with the maximum number of classes you can have as a part-time instructor.\n\nThe simple fact is, there are more people \\[officially\\] qualified for the jobs, than there are jobs. I personally would not recommend trying to get into this profession.

Metaethics is a very active area of study that draws from pretty much everywhere, but to get started in pretty much any field there are usually a couple of key sources that you want to read to get started, like \"what is it like to be a bat\" for phil of mind, but there are often good summaries that include all the relevant positions. Philpapers Is a great place to find papers, it has philarchive which is free, but if your CC has access to academic databases then you should be able to access most of the sites it links to.

These areas have their own specialized modern literatures, of course, but they're also quite easy to just pick up and read foundational texts on your own. I found it's easier to start \"fresh\" with more modern and technical work when you're in classes with other people discussing it, but you can get a lot out of reading, say, some Hume, Kant, James, and Dewey plus working through a good intro to symbolic logic and seeing if any of those grab you the way Aristotle has. And if they don't, you've still learned something useful about your interests. Plus, you can get books in all three areas as easily as the classical stuff you're reading now, without having to mess around with finding individual papers and clicking through eight different library websites trying to make your single sign-on work only to learn that none of your affiliated institutions subscribe to the journal you're looking for.

Could be a misunderstanding, or it's the fun and richness of philosophy....\n\nBut yeah, I think indeed it is just publishing articles by academics, but there are also a lot of conferences, where they present ideas/papers, and discuss them. And of course, academics amongst each other discuss everything before writing and publishing. \n\n>And how do i reconstruct a complete discourse on a specific topic if its spread around the globe as single articles in various papers of different languages?\n\nIt's not only single articles, you're gonna want books! Most of the topics you mention I know little to nothing about so I can't offer recommendations, but for example if you were into embodied cognition you could start with Mindware by Andy Clark. And there are also a lot of issues of books that get republished every year with updated articles. A good place to start would be 'The Routledge handbook of......' There are really a lot of books that compile everything and up to date as well! 'A very short introduction to....' also has many subjects, but maybe not niche enough. \n\nI'm not quite sure what your main question is, if you wanna get a feel of academic debates or learn to be more critical of your own writing?

But I was thinking that maybe you would be interested in these resources:\n\nYou could subscribe to the newsletter called Philos-L. (You're gonna want to set up a filter for this one!

And honestly I can’t imagine trying to make sense of the *Tractatus* without at least some formal training in logical notation and systemic thinking.\n\nI’d also recommend reading a biography of Wittgenstein — the man lived a life wild enough to warrant a major motion picture. *The Duty of Genius* by Ray Monk offers an investigative, fact-driven account, while *The World As I Found It* by Bruce Duffy is a beautiful, dramatized historical fiction that deftly intertwines the lives of Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein with minimal creative license.\n\nBeyond that, if you have auspices to attend law school yourself, a command of symbolic logic and its various systems of notation will simplify the LSAT to the point where it feels like Neo seeing the Matrix. It’s the arithmetic of argumentation, and it’s surprisingly learnable in a semester. I genuinely can’t overstate its usefulness in legal applications.\n\nAs for your thesis: I feel your frustration. It's admittedly tough to form a novel approach to these topics. Later Wittgenstein is notoriously tricky to critique because it’s explicitly unstructured, almost Freudian in nature. Its force comes not from any discrete set of claims therein, but rather from the perspective it pulls you into. But there's still room for original applications of his ideas outside of purely analytical philosophy, and legal theory is especially fertile ground.",

        "body": "Note: because of the nature of this question I will be speaking candidly and not necessarily with the goal of proving or disproving any concept.\n\n\nIt depends on what you mean by ontologically similar.  I do not believe the judeochristian god is ontologically similar to humans just for the fact that he cannot die.  He is also not ontologically similar to humans because he is alone in his experience, without peers and without a female opposite, which is unfortunately a reality for some humans,  but does not represent the general human experience.\n\nIt’s difficult to try and rationalize the idea of a singular all powerful god, but there are some interesting attempts available.  I think the judeochristian god is likely partially a projection of what humans subconsciously believe to be the end point of an ascent to power, as well as a projection of he subconscious desire to be governed by an authority figure after the protective world made by parents fades as one ages.  It’s possible that it’s real as it cannot truly be disproven, but such a reality would be illogical, unjust, and solitary.  Such a reality would signify that the base and thus ultimate nature of reality (hypostasis) is not merely the Christian notion of the Holy Spirit, metaphor or literal, but ego and power.  Again, I think this is similar to the subjective experience of many, but certainly not all, so here we see another contradiction to the idea of ontological similarity.  It is not particularly difficult to argue that those humans who live in a reality of which the ultimate nature is centered around power and the self live in the traditionally ungodly state of fear, which bequeaths states of vanity and the hunger for power.  One could even argue that fear is the sole architect of such a subjective reality,  which has interesting contradictory implications for divinity.  It seems to paint a picture of a contradictory, irrational god, who is both human in his faults, but all powerful.   From a psychological perspective, this may implicate both a struggling human’s perceived reality, and their desire to ascend to a singular state where the struggle for power no longer exists, which can only be a state of supremacy.\n\n\nA relevant question closely related to the stated question of this post: is god separate from humanity?  Christians will tend to say yes, we have been separated from god by sin.  This is another signification of an irrational god.  Sin can be defined as actions or states that go against god’s will.  But god willed sinners into existence.  Being all powerful, he would know they would sin, even if he granted them free will, and thus be doomed to eternal death or torture in hell.  What rational explanation could there be for this?  Is god committing an error?  Are sinners a mere redundancy in a cosmology that is in fact imperfect?   Or worse, has god willed sinners into existence for his own satisfaction or amusement?  There is an explanation among the esoteric fringes of Christian theology that offers an interesting answer, which is that god is actually purging itself of some sort of impurity,  which leads us to the idea of an altogether different sort of god.\n\n\nA god performing such an action implicates that humans are in fact not separate from god, but parts of god itself.  \n\n\n\nNote:  I have to leave and will be returning to edit in the rest of these ideas shortly.",

Neither of these fields is a \"thing\" that exists in the conventional sense; rather, existence itself—the quality of \"being\"—emerges from their relationship.\n\nIn this framework, the ontological question shifts from \"what exists?\" to \"what patterns of relationship generate persistent resonance?\" Being becomes relational rather than substantial.\n\nApplied to your question about God and ontological similarity, RET would suggest that both divine and human \"existence\" might be understood as different patterns of resonance within the same underlying fields—not as separately existing entities sharing some common property called \"being.\"\n\nThe divine pattern might represent a form of what I call \"harmonized spectral saturation\"—a complete resonant alignment across all dimensions of potential. Human existence, meanwhile, would represent a more localized, constrained pattern of resonance.\n\nThis view parallels aspects of Heidegger's critique of ontotheology and his distinction between beings and Being itself. It also resonates with negative theology's insistence that God transcends categorical attribution while still avoiding complete ineffability.\n\nThe advantage of this approach is that it allows us to understand God as neither wholly alien to human existence nor reducible to a \"supreme being\" that merely amplifies human attributes. Instead, both human and divine could be understood as different manifestations of the same fundamental process—the emergence of pattern through relationship.\n\nThis doesn't answer the question definitively, but it offers a framework where the paradox itself might dissolve. The question becomes not whether God \"exists\" in the same sense humans do, but how different patterns of resonance relate to each other within a unified field of potential.\n\nI'd be interested in your thoughts on whether this relational approach to ontology might offer a way beyond the limitations of substance-based metaphysics in theological discourse.",

So, as others have opined, apples and oranges: one operates on the abstract and the other operates on the empirical level.\n\nPopper, who sought to legitimise a 'scientific method' via empirical falsification, rejected Plato's reasoning for reasons largely owing to political ideology (see Popper's Open Society and its enemies).   The main plank of contention would be whether Popper's objection can be validly applied to the Theory of Forms and if so, why and to what extent, given the apparent difference in their very natures.  One goes towards perfecting our knowledge and the other towards perfecting our perception.\n\nBoth belong to differing schools of thought, which were born out of what they each desired to avoid.  Plato subscribed to the belief that 'universals' exist, out of a desire for man to go beyond the material reality and see the ideals (an abstract).  Popper subscribed to the belief that we should not generalise from from particular, out of a desire for man to avoid the pitfalls of overgeneralised thinking (for instance, the ideal of democracy falls short when one observes the empirical falsifiability present in each particular instance of a society supposedly categorised as a democracy).\n\nMy view is that one cannot exist without the other.  You need a keen perception (by applying the falsifiability criterion) combined with a keen ability to derive knowledge (by applying the Theory of Forms), and a continuous reiteration using both sources, to derive practical knowledge.",

So, in the case of something metaphysical, like Justice, the Form of Justice is revealed by the similarities manifest in particular events in which justice is sought. In other words, we start by identifying what people are aiming at when they strive toward justice and then infer the Form from the real-world events. The same is true of physical things, like Cats. We start by seeing lots of cats, we identify the similarities in our experiences, and thus we infer the Form, \"Cat.\"\n\nConceived of in this way, you could say that the Forms of physical objects are very rough approximations of Wittgenstein's scientific truths, and the Forms of metaphysical objects are very rough (context independent) approximations of Wittgenstein's social truths. That said, I don't think it is very helpful to think about Forms when discussing language.

Different types of philosophy, and different philosophers, have vastly differing approaches to understanding what natural science is or amounts to. So, if you're speaking this broadly, it's not clear that there is some fixed/stable thing to appeal to called \"the knowledge of Natural Science.\" A positivist, a pragmatist, and a phenomenologist could all take discoveries of natural sciences as facts, and they could all integrate them into their epistemology.

Analytic philosophy belongs principally to a period after modernism.\n\n> I think its largely a fair categorization that, predominantly, Analytic philosophy was consciously continuous with Natural Sciences, while, predominantly, Continental tradition was discontinuous with (and sometimes hostile to-) Natural Sciences, with exceptions in both.\n\nNo, this is definitely not a fair characterization. Somewhere around no continental philosophy is hostile to the natural sciences -- it's a strange idea, I'm not sure where you might have picked it up other than hot takes on social media or something, so I'm not sure what to say to try to clarify it.\n\nAnalytic philosophy is a broad and ambiguous tradition so there's not really much that can be said about it generally on this topic. The idea of a continuity with the natural sciences is associated with naturalism, which is certainly one significant current in analytic philosophy but far from the only one. Movements in analytic philosophy like logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy are distinct from naturalism and are so significant that it would be peculiar to dismiss them as mere exceptions to the rule. The same point about the diversity and ambiguity of continental philosophy can be made, but certainly there's a great deal of continental philosophy that denies categorical discontinuities between science and philosophy -- this is fairly common among post-structuralists for instance.\n\n\n> Modernism is a loaded concept that ranges over many disciplines, but focusing on epistemology, most will agree that Modernism trusts the centrality of Natural Science in the knowledge.\n\nNo, this is definitely not what modernism involves. The characteristic epistemological conditions of modernism concern challenges to the objectivity of knowledge in the face of the collapse of systematic philosophical projects, and attempts to articulate ways that historicism, authenticity, and pragmatism might replace them as the basic conditions of knowledge-seeking.\n\n> For Modernists, Natural Science isn't just another discipline of inquiry, but it rather occupies the center stage of human's knowledge of the world. This was evident in the Early Modern and Modern philosophies that stretch from 16st to 19st centuries.\n\nModernism is a movement of the late 19th century/early 20th century period, so it's not going to be well understood by appealing to the 16th-19th century period. The 16th-19th century periodization doesn't really identify any particular period of intellectual culture -- this conflates the late Renaissance, Enlightenment, and Romantic periods. In any case, the idea that natural science occupies center stage of human's knowledge of the world isn't really an apt characterization of these eras either, though it's hard to give a general statement of what is going on in these periods since this periodization conflates such diverse eras.\n\nIf you're interested in philosophy, it's probably worth trying to get past worrying about these kinds of labels and trying to get into the actual philosophy. In any case, I am curious to know where you're getting these ideas from. Is this informed by ChatGPT?",

So for something to exist it must be destroyed. We exist because our atoms were forged in the heart of stars before they explosively scattered their material. \n\nAs to pain and suffering, we've acknowledged that death is necessary to the process of our existence, pain is merely our nervous system informing us of damage. \n\nImagine our universe as a pool table.

But this is simply a statement of negative utilitarianism and is effectively an indictment of every human parent in history and seems like a plausible argument for voluntary extinction.\n\n\n\nConsider John a time T1: at this time John is composed of a sperm and egg approximately 1 meter apart. How much suffering is necessary for John at T1? In virtue of the fact he has no nervous system, he is incapable of suffering and hence no suffering is necessary for John at T1, thus all suffering is unnecessary suffering for John at T1 and he is at no risk of being a victim to any of it..\n\nNow consider John at T2: he is a newborn relatively healthy human baby. How much suffering is necessary for John at T2? Well, John’s teething, growing pains, vaccinations, heart-break over getting duped, grief at the death of a parent *etc* are types of suffering which are now plausibly necessary for John to experience. Moreover John as of T2 can now be a victim of unnecessary suffering as well.\n\nThese unnecessary types of suffering were imposed on John at some point between T1 and T2. John’s parents did not merely watch/allow these previously unnecessary sufferings being imposed on John, they actively participated in the imposition (via procreation). \n\nSince benevolence entails “wanting to minimize unnecessary suffering” and procreation is the active imposition of unnecessary suffering, procreation is not merely contrary to benevolence, it's an active opposition. The active opposition of benevolence is malevolence (*aka* evil), ergo procreation (and it’s participants) are malevolent. Parents are evil.\n\n\n\nFor our second hypothetical; consider that Bob has created a powerful virus, and  after extensive testing can confirm this virus has a 0% mortality rate, with no visible symptoms of pain or discomfort, it simply renders the human host sterile for life.\n\nIf Bob releases the rapidly spreading, symptom-free virus today he can be confident that within 150 years no human will be suffering unnecessarily: there will be no humans left they will be extinct.\n\nIf Bob does not release the virus today be will be standing by watching people continue to suffer unnecessarily. \n\nSince benevolence entails “wanting to minimize unnecessary suffering”, if Bob is benevolent then he will release the virus. Anyone opposed to Bods virus does not want to minimize unnecessary suffering, which is contrary to benevolence. Thus anyone opposed to Bob’s sterilising virus are evil.\n\n\n\nThat Premise 4 leads to the correct choice being the genocide of the human species suggests to me that the premise is absurd. Granted my intuition here could be mistaken, feel free to correct me on that point.\n\nSince “wanting to minimize unnecessary suffering” leads to conclusions that contradict our moral intuition about benevolence, it cannot be an accurate descriptor of benevolence. If it’s not an accurate descriptor of benevolence then it cannot be one of omnibenevolence. Thus by *reductio* Premise 4 is false.",

Turn it into a puzzle, rather than focusing on the nature of the content. And regarding relaying the nature of the content, if you don't find it interesting, make this into a puzzle too: what are the central substantive points, what points does the debate hinge on, are there any points you think are more salient, or are there some central issues that haven't been fully developed, or can be applied in a new way/to a context they haven't previously been applied? Approach it tactically: collect every bit of advice your lecturer has provided on writing a good philosophy essay, and make sure you are following all the steps.  \n\n\nSometimes my best grades in undergrad were from essays on topics I didn't particularly care about; sometimes this can actually help you see more clearly where critical engagement has the biggest payoff. If you're not invested in the outcome then this can be freeing, as long as you're invested in creating good, clear work.  \n\n\nOne thing I see a lot in undergrad essays is students trying to make it super interesting and creative, but this usually happens at detriment to clarity, precision, and narrow critical engagement. The highest graded essays are fairly simple, clear and to the point, with a tight, narrow critical focus. \n\n\nI'll repeat what I said above: go back to instructions provided on writing a philosophy essay. Once you grasp this, it's a large part of the battle, and really makes approaching even the most boring topics far easier.

You've raised some fascinating questions and I'm looking forward to seeing what else gets recommended by people working in academia on these areas. My impression is that there probably is quite a lot of unexplored territory here.\n\nKwame Anthony Appiah has written some potentially relevant stuff. His book Cosmopolitanism is probably the most relevant for you. The Honor Code is another interesting one which analyses conflict between new and old moral views and how and why the new ones are adopted.\n\nJohn Rawls addresses issues of how to organise a society in which people have differing values in A Theory of Justice and develops this further in Political Liberalism. I'm not a Rawls expert but I think he has to say that there is a conception of justice that everyone has to buy into (so you might say that at one level he can't accommodate total diversity in values) but within the system he derives from that conception there is room for diversity of \"comprehensive doctrines\" and ways to regulate the rights of groups adhering to them when they come into contact.\n\nThere is a collection of essays (I haven't read it yet but it looks relevant) called Prospects for a Common Morality edited by Outka and Reader and published by Princeton.\n\nI'm sure there's lots of anthropology literature out there to give case studies of how different belief systems (ethical, religious, legal, etc) have actually come into contact.\n\nAs for applied meta ethics that's a really interesting area. It was once a commonplace and some people would probably still argue that there is no such thing, that meta ethics is totally independent of practical decision making. That's not a view held so dogmatically now, but if people are open to the idea that metaethics could have practical consequences I haven't seen anyone actually trying to decide what they are.\n\nI'm keen to hear how you get on with this.

Sometimes one word for an object is used more in certain types of contexts so it gets associated with different things than another word for the same object. The semantic reference might be the same, but a person's mental model of the words might invoke associations of entirely separate silos. \n\nThink people who speak two languages: I speak Icelandic and a lot of young kids will have heard of \"Holland\" and cheer for them during the World Cup - wanting to go there to see their favourite player play a soccer match. Then they see their parents planning a trip to \"Netherlands\" and fail to make an association and get excited even though they know \"Netherlands\" as a concept of \"one of those countries in mainland Europe that speaks sort of a German/Austrian-like language\" since they only ever read the term *Netherlands* in this boring english school context. \n\nI don't think the argument hinges at all on it being *in a competent speaker* or within one language. The exact same thing happens frequently within a language of even competent speakers. Icelanders often have 3 different names for the same place, so often that people don't keep a mental or literal spreadsheet (although [here](https://is.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listi_yfir_%C3%BEj%C3%B3%C3%B0arbrot) is one); many just start to rely on associations that accumulate over time, and sometimes you'll make associations to one place under one tag and not under another tag. Sometimes you learn that two places you have a vague idea of or heard stories from are one and the same. \n\nHolland and Netherlands refer to the same things in real life, but in mental models of the world you may be diving into two different silos. Even after you tell the kids it's the same place, they'll still associate 'Holland' with the fun vibes of the World Cup and the tangible orange color of the team, and 'Netherlands' with the standardized list of European countries they had to study in English class.",

The Constitution is a text with codifed concepts that are operationalized in practice. You might have very \"concrete\" concepts like the use of land, or others that might be more philosophically-oriented, like liberty. \n\n The idea then is that diachronic political theory maps the prevalence of normative/ descriptive social concepts - once again, like liberty - and relates to them in the Constitutional text. Where it becomes interesting is that conceptual entailments change over time: what liberty meant in 1950 is not exactly what it might mean now, or in other words, might have a greater/ narrower scope. Here political theory might act as a bridge.\n\nIf this is of interest to you, you can connect with me and we can discuss these over DM.

And that explained why I always had a sense that while most of the psychology or INFP congruent jobs that sounded interesting to me, also probably felt like stuff I couldn’t do.\n\nSo I never did figure out what to do as far as career paths were concerned. (And so far as I can tell, about 80% of the autistic population is unemployed). So I can’t tell you anything about that. And it doesn’t help that I don’t know have any real sense of what you want to do with your undergraduate degree either.\n\nHowever, what I can tell you is that the philosophy department will give you a different mindset and skillset than the psychology department will. From what I can tell, psychology tends to place people in a research track, an organizational track, or a clinical track, so insofar as you are being prepared for anything aside from absorbing facts and concepts, you are being prepared for one of those tracks. The downside, so far as I can tell, is that most psychology majors don’t seem to be interested in systemically engaging with theory and don’t really know how to do this. As a result, although you may to see psychologists come up with hypotheses about how things work, they are far more likely to leave them as half-baked hypotheses than they are to turn them into substantive theories.\n\nOn the other hand, the primary objective of the philosophy department is to teach students how to critically engage with conceptual systems; how to analyze, evaluate, critique, modify, and synthesize conceptual systems. This means that if you put some time and effort into it, you’re eventually going to develop the ability to tinker with and create conceptual systems. And this can be useful to somebody who is interested in tinkering with and/or creating scientific theory. So, if you have any aspirations to doing any real system building, a la Skinner, Freud, etc...., in the future, a solid background in philosophy is something you should seriously consider.\n\nIn my own case, I have a long standing interest in psychological types (the MBTI types and David Keirsey’s 4 temperaments) and in the work of Belgian educational psychologist and autism expert Peter Vermeulen (specifically his understanding of autism as context blindness), and I think that I can use the skills I’ve acquired in systemic thinking as a philosophy student to help me write some papers related to my interests in these subjects.",

They won’t care about whether Heidegger saw technology as a gestell or if yuk hui says that we need more techno diversity. In any case, maybe, you’d be consulting in their marketing departments to repurpose those concepts as marketable buzzwords.

In several works, John Locke described a studious man he knew who went blind from smallpox at a young age.  This man struggled to understand visual concepts such as the yellow color of saffron, the clarity of the sun, or the color of scarlet, which the man compared to a trumpet.  Nonconformist minister John Troughton (1637-1681) went blind from smallpox at a young age.  Troughton was a fellow student with Locke at Oxford University.  Troughton’s sermons quoted the exact portions in Song of Solomon (Canticles 4-6) and Revelations (chapter 18) which contain the imagery (and the association of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets) found in Locke’s writings.  Thus, Locke’s comparison of the color scarlet with the sound of trumpets was probably not a description of synesthesia, but rather was an attempt of a blind scholar to understand Biblical imagery.\n\n**Conclusions**. The struggles of blind nonconformist minister John Troughton to understand Biblical imagery probably stimulated John Locke to ponder what humans can know innately about vision, independent of experience.",

Christoph Fehige, argues that *“we have obligations to make preferrers satisfied, but no obligations to make satisfied preferrers’ “ (1998)*.\n\nYou're getting a little confused there. The asymmetry is between the obligations we have to take the interests of currently existing sentient beings into account vs. the lack of an obligation to take potentially existing sentient beings into account. This is asymmetry is usually pointed out in response to the argument that eating meat is good because it brings more animals into existence with the potential to live happy lives. (Then you would say, no, we HAVE no obligation to bring ANYONE into existence, we only have an obligation to those who are CURRENTLY existing.)\n\nSo, you're mischaracterizing Singer's position here. As far as I can tell, he thinks of pleasure and pain as if they were points on a spectrum. So, 5 points of suffering is as bad as 5 points of pleasure is good. Honestly, I think better to think of both in terms of interests: we have an interest in not being harmed just as we have an interest in pleasurable things happening to us. All this to say that Singer would actually be pro Omelas. He only happens to be anti factory farms because he thinks the pain there is greater than the pleasure. Eating meat isn't THAT good. But if a single burger could make us immensely happy for the remainder of our lives then guess what, he'd be pro burger.\n\nOtherwise, nice job. This is definitely at the college level. Let me know if you want some reading recommendations in animal ethics.",

        "body": "For context, I'm an American first year grad student in philosophy. A few remarks:\n\nYour writing ability is quite good for your age. Specifically, you have a strong vocabulary and understanding of the technical aspects of English grammar. This suggests you've been reading a lot and paying attention in English class. The former is a particularly important habit in philosophy. Good philosophy students are frequent readers of philosophy because that's how you gain exposure to more ideas. Your main weaknesses are in style, structure, and diction, which tends to be a struggle for college undergraduates in the US, so I wouldn't worry about that. Improvement will come with more writing and letting people who are fully proficient in English review your work on a sentence to sentence level.\n\nWhen it comes to arguments, I would identity two related issues. The first is that your treatment of the topic tends toward breadth over depth. You cover the ideas of many people without going into too much detail about anyone in particular. The second is that you tend to have too many unjustified assumptions and don't address the main objections to your lines of reasoning. I say that these are related because it would be easier to answer potential counterarguments if you had fewer distinct arguments. Philosophy papers that are narrower and deeper are almost uniformly better than ones that are broad but shallow.\n\nAn example:\n\n>Yet our intuitive ethical positions prove these as irrelevant as we may source examples of humans, clearly deserving of moral consideration, with respective faculties lower than non-human animals. In spite of this, a human being will unanimously be considered entitled to greater moral respect than an animal.\n\nYou are assuming that there is a unanimous consensus that human beings have moral standing by virtue of some trait other than their cognitive capacities, but this is untrue. First, the lack of such capacities in humans at early stages of development is commonly cited as an argument in favor of the permissibility of abortion. Second, we do treat adult humans with diminished mental capabilities as lacking certain rights that other adults have, such as the right to make their own legal decisions. You can potentially address these issues, and should.\n\nAnother comment has addressed your reading of Fehige. I would agree that it is incorrect for the reason given by u/tofutigre. To understand the issue that Fehige is focused on addressing, you should read about the \"repugnant conclusion\" as introduced by Derrick Parfit. It's related to this topic, but it doesn't directly pertain to your argument. What this leaves you with is an assumption that pleasure and suffering are incommensurate in a way that is not really supported. The question of what to do in the case of Omelas remains unaddressed. I don't want to repeat the previous comment too much, but I think that's a central issue. Consider how you would address this objection: \"Surely it must be worth it to cause one being a small amount of pain in order that many beings experience great happiness.\"\n\nTo wrap up, this is a good paper for your level of experience. I think it would be suitable for a college undergrad level for sure. If you want to stand out, especially in upper division classes, you want to focus on narrowing your discussion and exploring the arguments in more detail. The ability to do this well will come with more practice. For now, reading widely about the topic is actually a very good sign. I would be happy to discuss this paper more if you have any questions.",

One comes from Johanna Macy and her distinction between power-over and power-with. Power usually has the connotations of power over people or objects in a dominating or willful fashion. Her distinction of power-with emphasizes the power inherent in cooperation and collaboration. My power grows your power and vis versa as we both find greater capacity to meet our needs.\n\nThe other conversation about power lays in critical theory, like michel Foucault. This brings in the dynamic of systematic power, the power passed down by cultural hegemonic tradition, and the power inherent in language in constructing our world view. Critical theory’s inquiry (who is telling the story/theory? Who does the story/theory serve? Whose voice is missing in the story/theory?) is a great pathway into deconstructing the power dynamics inherent in philosophical or cultural discourse. Plenty of discourse or text presents itself in a neutral or objective way, which underscores a particularly prominent position of power by our modern world view - and it is far from unbiased. \n\nThese two provide some additional dimension to our understanding of power in philosophical discourse to the inquiry you’ve begun.",

A couple things that might help - more about attitude than technique:\n\n* You know, it's OK if you don't get the best grade in your class for this one module! Especially if it's outside your primary areas of study, you'll be fine. It's not 100% clear to me whether you're an undergraduate or graduate student. But if the former, one course won't wreck your chances of getting into grad school; if the latter, doing poorly in this class will *at worst* cut you off from like one hyperspecific job that needs your specialization and also someone who can teach graduate-level philosophy of math.\n\n* This stuff is hard and professors know that. Unless the culture at your school is bad, they're not going to go at you for having trouble any more than they'd go at someone for not using \"Being\" in the exact right way (whatever that even is). If that *is* how your professors act, you have bigger problems anyway.\n\n* And here's a personal experience. I went into philosophy after trying to study engineering and being unable to keep up with the math. I muddled along farther than you did, but I never really understood what I was doing. My required graduate logic course was actually the thing that \"unlocked\" math for me. Coming at things like computability and proof theory as tools for doing philosophy, not as context-free symbol manipulation, made them click. That course reframed math for me as a language, a way of expressing concepts in a specialized syntax, which is...what doing philosophy already is, just with different squiggles on the page. I'm still no mathematician and my work didn't get more formal, but I'm much more comfortable with mathematical concepts. Something like that might happen to you, so keep an open mind if you can.",

When you get to small regional journals, journals with paid submissions, or some online journals in their first year or two, it makes a difference. But you'll easily identify these.

More often than not, if you have a UK undergraduate, especially from Oxford or Cambridge, you should be able to go straight to a US PhD programme. Sometimes a student will have to do a one year masters to increase their competitiveness, but this is more true for people who study at American Universities. This is at least true in for PhD Programmes and sub-disciplines I am familiar with. Either way, for a European (i.e. UK) PhD you would need a masters.\n\nI do not know as much about NYU Abu Dhabi (strangely, I had a friend who taught history there for a few years, he liked it well enough, but left as Covid began). I would say that the NYU brand in philosophy is strong, but Cambridge is a more established and reputable university. Historically, American PhD programmes are made of a mixture of students straight from Undergraduate and those who have done Masters, recently the trend has been strongly towards the latter.\n\nIf it is just about how eligible the programme will make you for a PhD in Philosophy, Cambridge seems a no brainer to me, but there are lots of other factors. That said, doing an undergraduate you would learn more in and potentially excel is more important than doing the 'right' undergraduate. Would you rather take a series of general courses and studies in other disciplines or focus solely on Philosophy? Would you prefer to live in Abu Dhabi than the UK?\n\nPS - Which Cambridge College should not really matter for PhD prospects. More than anything, it affects living arrangements than education(especially at Cambridge compared to Oxford).",

Do the faculty who made the department what it is *teach* in Abu Dhabi?  Or only in New York?\n\nSpeaking of \"brands\" there was a time when Cambridge was **the** place to do analytic philosophy and it wasn't even close.  Though Russell, Moore, and Wittgenstein are no longer with us that shine takes a long time to wear off and it's not like the current faculty are lacking in any way. It's more like they're \"some of the very, very best\" instead of \"the undisputed best by a large margin\".\n\nLeiter's report is significant, but it isn't the end-all be-all of program quality and it's explicitly a ranking of PhD programs.  Some of the metrics might be relevant to undergraduate education as well, but the essential purpose of his guide is to help students applying to graduate programs to evaluate them with a view to acquiring a tenure-track position.  It's a very different calculation to determining what undergrad program is right.  To put it in perspective, I did my undergraduate degree at a school that Leiter ranks near the bottom of the schools he bothers to rank at all. I took a relatively rigorous course load including graduate courses in logic, meta ethics, and philosophy of science.  At the same time I flunked Greek Philosophy and had to retake it, despite double-majoring in Ancient Greek, because the professor was a jackass and also spend a third of the class on Presocratic philosophers I wasn't interested in.  I still ended up being accepted to MIT\"s graduate.program, but didn't go because the professor I wanted to work with (Judith Jarvis Thomson) was about to retire and wasn't supervising any more PhDs.\n\nThis also might be a bit of an ask for an undergrad, but...do you have an idea what sub disciplines you're most interested in?  That might help as well to make a decision.\n\nIn any event, a first-class degree from Cambridge will make you as competitive an applicant as any to the top programs in the US, Canada, UK, or Australia.",

After the MPhil, you would proceed into a DPhil / PhD programme. An MSci in Philosophy of Science is also offered at Cambridge, which has a distinct History and Philosophy of Science faculty (which falls under the Natural Science banner). In fact, you would be studying with Philosophers of Science who came from Physics degrees in this course.\n\nThe Cambridge Philosophy BA also does offer some interdisciplinary options that intersect more with STEM. For example, the Philosophy of Science paper in third year has a range of different sciences that you can focus on, from Philosophy of Physics to Economics, Sociology, Psychiatry, Cognitive Science and Biology. It also offers a Math Logic paper in third year which focuses on the core Philosophy of Maths topics, like First- and Second-Order Logic, Set Theory, and Computability theory. Although that obviously is a far cry from double majoring with Maths, it still gives you some mathematical exposure (along with the Philosophy of Physics topic in the Phil Science paper), especially to Philosophically pertinent parts of Mathematics. Second year also offers a paper on early Analytics, which contains some more philosophy of maths and logic, a paper on Philosophy of Scientific methods, and an experimental psychology paper that involves experiments and data analysis. So, you do have an option there to gear yourself more towards STEM parts of philosophy. There is also some Eastern Metaphysics in third year too, although it's largely limited to stuff on the self. It definitely is an Analytic heavy/Eurocentric course otherwise though.\n\nAlso, a final thing I would add is that college prestige does not matter as everyone does the same course regardless of college at Cambridge anyways. Your final grade and writing samples are the more important components of your Academic profile.",

I also disagree with other comments above about presumably suggest that NYU-NY will give you a better education than NYUAD. NYUAD will give you the better quality education for your beginning years over NYUNY or Cambridge because you will be engaging with professors in small seminars and then you will be able to go to New York to study with top philosophers later on; and you can even take graduate level coursework there so it will also be small seminars. Being thrown into NYU-NY in your first two years in these big lecture halls will not help you with doing advanced philosophical works, but NYUAD will give you a more solid foundation. Cambridge also doesn’t allow double major/minor to my knowledge. But this is just a biased opinion from someone who has more knowledge of NYUAD and NYU-NY and limited knowledge of Cambridge…",

Our preferences for fatty and sugary food seem to be derived from pure nutritional features, and our preferences for coastal views from hilltops are probably derived from some other evolutionary source. There are many species for which the sexual preferences have important features that are well-explained by costly signaling (most famously the peafowl). But I'm not aware of anyone having argued that a majority of human aesthetic preferences are explained by costly signaling theory.\n\nI'm not particularly familiar with work in aesthetics, so I don't know how much of it engages with work in economics, biology, and game theory on adaptive preferences (whether for costly signaling or other sorts). I think there's a lot of work in aesthetics that is operating at a different level, that either takes the existence of aesthetic preferences for granted, or argues for a certain kind of aesthetic value that is independent of preferences.\n\nThe literature on costly signaling certainly is discussed in certain parts of philosophy of language, political philosophy, philosophy of economics, and other related areas that I am a bit more familiar with.",

Since presumably we are here talking about aesthetics from a biological and naturalistic point of view this will tell us nothing about the capacity of aesthetic evaluation or why a particular instance have certain aesthetic qualities. The laws of physics and chemistry supervene on any biological filter, this provides a class of forms from which the biological filter chooses the most fit form.\n\nToday vast majority of biologist are not Neo adaptationist but evolutionary development biologist who look into the process of ontogenesis from say a chemical or physics or homological view point.\n\nWhat we call human aesthetic capacity is very different from animal aesthetic capacity and is probably never selected for, it is possibly exadapted or is spandrel.

Consider, for example, the fact that we're successfully communicating right now (hopefully). We can ask all kinds of philosophical questions about this: How is it that we're communicating? What does communication imply about the nature of mind or consciousness? How can we know that words have the same meanings for both of us? How did they get those meanings? These questions can feel both daunting and pressing, and when daunting and pressing questions are rattling around your head, your head is very loud. It can be distressing, moreover, when your head is very loud. You know what can alleviate the distress? Reminding yourself that, regardless of the answers to these questions, and regardless of whether we even ask them, *we successfully communicate with each other all the time.* To content oneself with this thought--that, regardless of these questions, we know that we successfully communicate, and this is enough (at least for certain purposes)--is quietism in nutshell. There are, of course, different flavors of quietism. For example, one might think that quietism is one option among others, or that it is the only option that makes sense about certain matters (e.g., because metaphysical questions are misguided in a way that renders real debate about such matters impossible).

This can, and should be, considered separately from the philosopher themself; we have to avoid the ad hominem logical fallacy.\n\nSo my opinion is that interesting philosophies, with valid and plausible arguments, are worth considering and are not negated by non-related abhorrent views (and/or actions) of the arguer. Then the philosophical value can be judged on what their work does to advance the discussion. \n\nIf a philosopher’s work is pertinent to an area of philosophy I’m interested in, and especially if they have ideas that a lot of subsequent dialectic relies on or refers to, I think it would be irresponsible to not take it seriously. If Sartre were still around, as a responsible parent of course I wouldn’t consider letting him get to know my kids, but I’d be an epistemically irresponsible philosopher if I didn’t consider the questions and claims raised by his works.\n\nOf course, just because I think it’s important to do it, that doesn’t make it easy! I’m a woman, so of course it’s personally hard to look past the misogynistic views common to many philosophers of the past. I mean, Aristotle would probably say I should be home cleaning toilets, Maimonides would tell people to shut up if they started talking metaphysics in front of me and there’s a long list of others (Hegel, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche come to mind) who carried on bigoted traditions and some were pretty terrible people and I resent their related negative influence on society. But what kind of philosopher would I be if I ignored them or disregarded everything they had to say?  \n\nBasically, I just have to look past all the ancillary yuck to extract what I can value. But isn’t that part of the action of philosophy anyway? Sorting through ideas—ours and others’—and determining, not which people, but which ideas/claims/theories/approaches/questions are worth our continued attention? \n\nThe topic of OP’s questions is important, though, and should be kept in mind, especially because of the possibility of theoretical creep. Part of the weeding through process needs to involve watching for and being conscious of ways their junky personal views influenced their philosophy, and then making sure it doesn’t get subsequently woven into ours or keep tainting philosophical progress.",

Take Heidegger - Nazism is a philosophically and morally reprehensible ideology, and I think that a contemporary philosopher who sincerely believes in it is worth critique and reassessment. But Heidegger’s work came about in a different era, and it could be argued that he shouldn’t be held accountable for the political and cultural circumstances of his time. BUT, it could also then be argued that we have little to take from his philosophy, if the world in which he wrote his philosophical texts AND engaged in Nazi ideology is so distinct from our own.\n\nAdditionally, it must matter how important a person’s ideological failings are to their work. If the electrician I hire to fix my wiring problems holds some genuinely concerning political beliefs, it really shouldn’t impact the quality of his work. Similarly, if a philosopher wrote primarily on, say, animal ethics, one may be able to argue that some unfortunate beliefs on homosexuality are, if not permissible, able to be glanced over in favour of the philosophy. But if we look to certain philosophers for moral guidance or political philosophy, it certainly makes sense to be more critical of the more pernicious elements of their work.\n\nI think it’s understandable to want to take the good bits and throw out the rest.

I'm not a philosopher of science (I wish) but I'm a psychologist working extensively with language/discourse, with an interest on the philosophical implications of language-science-thought axis. Also this question is relevant to academic psychology as well as academic philosophy.\n\nIn psychology the Whorfian hypothesis held sway for a while but it tends not to be so prominent anymore. Chomsky's theory of language is now commonly accepted (not by myself) by majority of the psychological community.\n\nWittgenstein's later philosophy suggests that language and meaning of words is communal, and there is lot of research inspired by his philosophy which seems to suggest that we can explain the function of language without the need to infer thoughts - looking to its social function instead. In fact, there is so much \"social\" going on with language that to get past that to make assumptions about thought requires a research model of language that is completely unrecognisable and stripped from how people use words and text.\n\nFeyerabend makes a similar-ish but also different point, in a more roundabout way. He argued that our theories (he spoke primarily of science) restrict our perception and we have to learn to think differently before we can do science differently.\n\nThe point of both of these philosophies (both challenge and undermine conventional Vienna Circle of logical positivism, which heavily influences common strands of assumptions and research about language) and the wealth of research in some subdisciplines of psychology and sociology, suggest that language is highly malleable. It is very difficult to empirically establish a link between language and thought. For all the research in cognitive psychology, we have no direct empirical evidence of *cognitions*. Plenty of alternative theories within psych that suggests a different view on thought.\n\nSorry if it's not a philosophical answer to your question, but, I think, still a relevant one!",

If you only get a bachelors in philosophy this will not significantly impact your ability to write the papers you want to write. Even if you were to get a masters the case would be similar. Going through that training would familiarize you with conventional ways of creating that type of academic work, but you can learn that through your own study, if you’re reasonably smart and motivated. At most, take a couple electives or audit a course rather than committing to studying it. Your ability to publish is likely going to be the same coming from an architecture department without a philosophy degree as it would be with a lower one.\n\nTo get unstuck I suggest moving away from general philosophy or history of, and toward writings in the field you’re most interested in. Search for philosophy journals in aesthetics that might cover the specific topic you’re interested in. As a student you should be able to access those through your school.\n\nBy reading more contemporary work on aesthetics you can familiarize yourself with the dominant views. You should also pay attention to the primary sources that philosophers today cite and seek those out as a way to build your understanding of the more foundational aesthetic theory at play in their works. You could then reference those foundational views in your own work, since proper academic philosophy requires a tether to existing literature and theory.\n\nWhen you do start writing those papers, be sure to ask members of the philosophy department to review and provide feedback. The only way to get good at playing the academic publishing game is to practice it and create a feedback loop with other professionals in the field. Expect to fail early on, but know that it’s possible to succeed with enough study and commitment to refining your work.",

What, if anything, is doing the thinking requires something else to establish its existence. I suggest reading what Hume had to say about the self in *A Treatise of Human Nature* (Book I, Part IV, Section VI). Here is a sample:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>For my part, when I enter most intimately into what I call *myself*, I always stumble on some particular perception or other, of heat or cold, light or shade, love or hatred, pain or pleasure. I never can catch *myself* at any time without a perception, and never can observe any thing but the perception. When my perceptions are remov'd for any time, as by sound sleep; so long am I insensible of *myself*, and may truly be said not to exist. And were all my perceptions remov'd by death, and cou'd I neither think, nor feel, nor see, nor love, nor hate after the dissolution of my body, I shou'd be entirely annihilated, nor do I conceive what is farther requisite to make me a perfect non-entity. If any one upon serious and unprejudic'd reflection, thinks he has a different notion of *himself*, I must confess I can reason no longer with him. All I can allow him is, that he may be in the right as well as I, and that we are essentially different in this particular. He may, perhaps, perceive something simple and continu'd, which he calls *himself*; tho' I am certain there is no such principle in me.\n\n[https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#3](https://davidhume.org/texts/t/1/4/6#3)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDescartes assumes more than is warranted from thinking.",

Academics have the freedom to discriminate between sound and unsound arguments. They can reject papers on grounds they do not have sufficient academic merit. If they do not have the power to discriminate on these grounds, then academia would be a cess pool like the comment section of a youtube video. \n\nUltimately, the issue is whether they abused their academic freedom and rejected his article on non-academic (perhaps purely partisan) grounds.

There are questions about how evenly this standard is applied by OUP and I'm sure his book got extra scrutiny for this due to its content. If so that's not fair. But it remains that case that ideally OUP *ought* to be publishing only books that stay away from needlessly inflammatory culture-war content.\n\nI happen to think that there actually *is* a serious problem with publishing on gender issues in academia, and that is because having actually spoke directly to some (i.e. Stock) about their experiences I've been shocked by the hostile, absurdly poor refereeing they've recieved.  But Byrne himself wrote at BL's blog that \"the book is not a scholarly monograph; it is aimed at a general audience interested in the topic of sex and gender. There’s not all that much “philosophy” in it anyway.\"  It's not clear why anyone should expect a book like that to come out with OUP.",

In fact, we perceivers must intuit space and time a priori because our very experiences of reality depend on us employing those categories to have the kinds of experiences we have at all.\n\nKant’s arguments for this are complicated, and have been challenged, but they have to do with our ability to deduce conclusions about space and time that are not dependent on our experiences - so they are understood (intuited) a priori.\n\nIt may make sense to you to consider whether it would even be possible to see objects in the world and apparent time-ordered causation as we do if we didn’t come already equipped with those categories of understanding. Without them it might seem as if everything outside of us was just one complex thing rather than many individual things, for example. \n\nIt’s strange to think of space and time as subjective, but modern physics supports this view in various ways. We experience 3 dimensions of space but there could be more. We experience time “passing” at a certain speed, but someone moving at much higher speed would experience it moving slower, etc. \n\nReading this may also help:\nhttps://www.rep.routledge.com/articles/biographical/kant-immanuel-1724-1804/v-1/sections/space-time-and-transcendental-idealism#:~:text=Kant's%20argument%20is%20that%20'determinations,properties%20are%20intuited%20a%20priori.",

The limits of our experience are the lenses through which we experience the world. We are born with these lenses and are the same for all rational beings. So in a sense space and time are subjective, because they are put forth by ourselves when we experience the world, but they are also objective in the sense that they are necessary and a priori for any rational being, which makes it possible for humans to communicate and create intersubjective knowledge.",

(They also are quite interesting in themselves, which is the primary reason I would suggest reading them.) But you certainly don't need to read everything that they wrote; if you read everything by them, you are going to be with Plato for a very long time, and then with Aristotle for a very long time, as both wrote quite a few works. But you can read just a few things by each to get a feel for them. You might want to first pick up something on the presocratic philosophers, maybe something like *Before and After Socrates* by Francis Cornford, though you may prefer something more recent. But it is short and readable.\n\nFor Plato, I would suggest reading, in this order, *Euthyprho*, *Apology*, *Crito*, *Phaedo*, *Republic*. The first four of those together tell the story of Socrates' trial and results, with philosophical ideas along the way.\n\nFor Aristotle, the *Nicomachean Ethics* would be the first thing I would suggest reading. Beyond that, I will leave it to others to make suggestions.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor many of us, the way we were introduced to the writings of the above were in books like this:\n\n[https://hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/introductory-dialogues/classics-of-western-philosophy-eighth-edition](https://hackettpublishing.com/philosophy/introductory-dialogues/classics-of-western-philosophy-eighth-edition)\n\nThat has bits and pieces of some of the works, but with some works in their entirety (that one clearly states which are complete and which are not). I am not sure if that would be better or worse than picking up whole works. I suppose it depends on what, exactly, you are wanting to accomplish. The obvious advantage to such a book is that you are exposed to a wider variety of their works with less reading. The obvious disadvantage is that you don't get the original context from which the snippets are taken.\n\n(If you were picking up something to read on your own, you could go with an old edition of something like that, which likely could be purchased for very little money.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou might also want to read some Epicurus, like his *Principle Doctrines* and *Letter to Menoeceus*. Both are quite short, and gives you something quite different from Plato and Aristotle.\n\nAnother suggestion is reading the *Enchiridion*, or *Handbook*, of Epictetus. It is also quite short. Unlike the above, Epictetus was Roman, not Greek, but we don't have the writings of the original Greek stoics, so this is as good as you are going to get for ancient stoicism.\n\nWith this, you have two major schools of thought beyond Plato and Aristotle, and their influence shows up more than one might guess from how much more famous Plato and Aristotle are.\n\nObviously, if you take a particular interest in any of the above philosophers, you can read as much as you like (or, in the case of Epicurus and Epictetus, all that survives, without reading that much).\n\nAnd, to help you along the way, there are many articles online about these philosophers.

Given how difficult the text is, I'd say to go with whichever one resonates more with you.\n\nOn that note, this is one of those texts that really benefits from being read alongside good secondary literature. [The Stanford Encyclopedia entry, by Mike Wheeler](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heidegger/), is a great starting point. Some introductions I can recommend: Richard Polt's *Heidegger: An Introduction*, Michael Inwood's *Heidegger: A Very Short Introduction,* Paul Gorner's *Being and Time: An Introduction* and Stephen Muhall's *Routledge Guidebook to Heidegger's Being and Time.* Michael Inwood's *A Heidegger Dictionary* is also super useful. If you want to learn more about the debate over how Heidegger's life and politics relate to his philosophy, Richard Wolin's *Heidegger in Ruins* recently made a big splash and is worth exploring.",

For one thing, unless you get quite far along in the process, no one is going to remember who you are or that you applied for the job.\n\nWith regard to your actual question, when TT positions ask for a teaching dossier, they usually want something like:\n\n1. Teaching statement\n2. List of classes taught (until you have 5+ courses taught, I'd include *clearly labeled* TA-ships and marking, but not guest lectures or presentations). \n3. Student evals\n4. Sample syllabi\n\nI don't know whether a local community college looking to hire a part-time instructor for a summer seminar is going ask for any those or how much they'll care about them. When local colleges near where I got my PhD wanted someone to do part-time work, they would reach out to the department to ask if there were any interested graduate students. I suspect that in those circumstances, they would not be expecting you do have taught many classes or developed a sophisticated teaching statement yet, but I could be wrong about that.\n\nAs for when you should start preparing a teaching dossier, the one thing that I would say is that you should plan on re-writing any materials that you prepare more than a few months ahead of time: trying to put together a teaching dossier now is no different from trying to put together a research dossier now. Your thoughts about teaching are going to change when you actually start teaching, and your thoughts about how to design a class on (say) Early Modern philosophy are going to change after you teach your first class on the subject. \n\nWhat I would suggest doing is reaching out to senior graduate students in the program to see if any of them have taught the kinds of classes you're looking to teach and ask them what materials they needed to submit. They're more likely to have a better sense for what the expectations and prospects are than those of us who have no idea where you are or what the local circumstances are at the departments in question.",

Specializing in foundations of math and set theory is slightly more accessible, but not by much. Computer Science degree focused on computability and complexity theory is probably the most widely available.  \n\nI would recommend browsing mathoverflow for questions that interest you, then hunting down papers published by people that answer those questions and finding what university they are affiliated with when they published.",

Start a blog, join or start a reading group, audit fun courses that pop up at nearby universities etc. If you can't see your life continuing without pursuing it in a more formal fashion, I would also recommend philosophizing on that a bit. If you honestly feel that way (though I imagine you're just being hyperbolic) you need to reevaluate life in a serious way. You're almost certainly going to be in the same spot six years later figuring out how to continue engaging with philosophy when you can't find a job in the field.  \n\nNow if you're rich or have rich parents or something and want to do it for fun, have at it. If you're serious about getting a job in the field after the PhD, I think sooner rather than later would be the time to pursue it.\n\nI'm not trying to be overly harsh, and I don't know the particulars of your situation so of course my advice should be taken with a big grain of salt, but the advice I gave applies to 90%+ of people considering a PhD in philosophy IMO.",

Not only do you need to want to \"do\" philosophy you have to want to do research and write publishable articles (the publication success rate of most good journals is way below 5%). Lots of folks who love philosophy in the first camp can complete a PhD, success as a philosopher is much much more about the second.

Present the main point as clearly and convincingly as you can. Treat the presentation as an invitation for the members of the audience to read the full paper (which is what you want anyways).

But a few things to keep in mind:\n\nThe real point of a conference is the friends you make along the way. Conferences are how you meet people outside your own university who are interested in the same topics as you, or adjacent ones, and they expose you to a wider range of personalities, some of whom will hopefully become good friends that (if you stay in the profession) you will continue meeting for the rest of your life.\n\nThe talk itself and the question period are the most intense part where you can get something very specific for this specific paper, but the conversations over lunch or at the bar or in the lobby are often where ideas start to crystallize that will become a paper three years from now.\n\nEven beyond the friendships and the paper ideas, the people you meet at conferences are your glimpse into the minds of your potential audience. You can find out that the way you're thinking about one of your projects doesn't grab people, but after a conversation you might realize that if you present it the way that seems backwards to you, suddenly everyone gets it.\n\nSome of this depends on the details of the conference. Some of these features are more pronounced at conferences on a specialized topic, but some of it works even at the most general conferences.\n\nAlso, at most conferences, there's a good chance that you're not speaking beyond a group of maybe 20 people anyway. At most philosophy conferences, I think the majority of attendees are on the program. So the number of people you can expect to be in the audience at your talk is at most about twice the number of talks that you expect to attend over the course of the conference. (Usually a bit more if it's a conference associated with a university department or some other built-in audience of non-presenters - but even then, that's not that much more than 20 usually.)",

A PhD is a big commitment, roughly 5-6 years on average, and not something you can treat as a hobby or a side activity. Unless you are planning to finance it entirely on your own (in which case you need to have a lot of money to burn), you will be expected to teach as a condition for getting paid (likely around 20 hours a week), attend department events, take classes for 2-3 years, conference, and conduct research. It is not the sort of thing you can realistically do while working another job, and many departments will outright forbid you from doing so in their contracts. I worked between 40 and 60 hours a week during my program, and even then I often felt like I was falling behind in my work.\n\nBut setting aside the practicalities of doing it, a PhD is also simply a bad way to learn about philosophy, as odd as that may sound. Graduate school is not just harder and more advanced undergrad, where you get to take courses on a wide array of topics. PhDs are job training; they are training you to be a professor and researcher.\n\nWhen you do research, all of your time and attention will be dedicated to a tiny sliver of one of philosophy's many subfields, for years at a time, because such specialization is a necessity to have publishable work, and published work is needed for career advancement. And the degree to which you have to specialize is far greater than many realize going in. There is no reason to do this unless you are wanting to go into academia; someone with a personal, rather than professional, interest in philosophy would be far better off simply studying philosophy on their own. That way they have the freedom to approach those studies as they want and jump around between topics.\n\nI know a lot of people who went into philosophy PhDs because they loved philosophy and did well in undergrad. Many of them learned too late that loving the field isn't enough, and that graduate school doesn't much resemble undergrad. Some of these people borderline ruined their lives; failed marriages, years of poverty wages, damage to their mental health, large opportunity costs, and the like. It just isn't worth it, especially not for its own sake alone.",

About 20 years ago, it was not uncommon to go directly from an undergrad in math or physics or English, who had taken a few philosophy classes and done well, into a PhD program. These days, it's much more common to do it by first getting an MA in philosophy, partly because there are so many people who have already done that MA that most PhD programs are able to fill their class without taking chances on someone a bit less known.\n\nI don't know how feasible it is to do a PhD in philosophy while maintaining a side job that takes 20-25 hours a week. I don't know of anyone that has specifically done something like this, though it might be possible. Admissions committees will not think it sounds like a plausible idea though.\n\nMore importantly, admissions committees see the primary goal of their PhD program as producing people who want to do academic research. Not everyone with a philosophy PhD will go into philosophy academia - but a good portion of those that don't will end up working for a think tank or a government agency or a corporation in some sort of research-oriented job.\n\nThe goal of a PhD is not learning - it is to get someone to take part in the creation of new knowledge.",

Do it right.\n\n*if you’re committed to staying at postgrad level then look at courses which aren’t directly about ‘philosophy’ but consider philosophical themes - the MA in [Religion in Peace and Conflict](https://www.uu.se/en/admissions/master/selma/program/?pKod=RRP2M) at Uppsala might be a good option for you in that case (it involves two trips to Sweden though).",

I secured a no-teaching scholarship, so that was a big help. This meant I only had to worry about my thesis and writing papers/attending conferences. If I didn't plan on going into academia it would've meant I only had to focus on the thesis.\n\nBecause of this, I've had time to continue my freelance hardware writing work alongside the PhD. And even then, I've had plenty of free time for other hobbies. I just had to make sure (and not always successfully!) that I was strict on myself when it came to time/routine/etc. and really knuckled down when I was doing the philosophy work. I'd say I work maybe 30 hours p/w on the thesis, giving me another 15 work hours p/w for a combination of working on papers, doing my freelance writing for extra money, and other work-enhancing hobbies. Then I have a normal amount of free time outside of that.\n\nCaveat: I'm having to step my game up and devote more time to the thesis over the coming months as I near the finish line, but this is arguably because of other factors than the time I'd put into the thesis previously (a difficult second year of the PhD, research-wise). This is meaning I'm now working many more work hours in the week. Be prepared for there to be periods like this during the PhD - you never know which chapters are going to cause a headache and require much more research than you anticipated.\n\nI would say what you want is possible given a few conditions. First, you get lucky and land a scholarship/studentship/grant that you know won't require too much of you (e.g. little or no teaching, little or no other modules/lessons to complete, little or no extra-thesis research to do). Second, you find a good supervisor that wants to support you through the application(s). Third, you pick a topic that (a) your supervisor's happy with and (b) you think you'll be interested in researching for many years. Finally, you're sure you won't regret being locked in to this thing two or three years down the line - the topic then might not be as interesting to you, the money you're getting from it might not be great, and you might start feeling like you've wasted your time.\n\nIf you can do all of the above, and if you get lucky, it might be possible.\n\n\\[edit\\]\n\nI'd also already done a research masters (30k word thesis) before this, so I had the benefit of knowing what it was going to be like.

Usually a discipline change like this requires some kind of academic history/proficiency from the adjoining program. For example, an English student interested in literary theory or deconstruction applying to a PhD program that specializes in continental philosophy. GRE scores alone won't fulfill this. You'll need a writing sample (10-20 pages) of quality philosophical writing, academic references that can position your fit in a philosophy program, and a detailed SOP demonstrating this proficiency. And even with all this material, you are competing against hundreds of other applicants with direct backgrounds in philosophy and (usually) graduate degrees. I say this not to insinuate it is impossible but to illustrate the rather minimal odds working against you.\n\nMoreover, for the other reasons mentioned here, a PhD doesn't seem to be the best fit for you. I would take the next year to try and refine your application dossier (writing sample, SOP, references, CV, etc.) and apply to MA programs (most deadlines will be in Feb/March). The odds are still working against you, but MA admissions aren't as competitive and your transition won't appear to be as much of a negative.

To this I would say yes, morality is sometimes alienating, but who promised you that morality would fit comfortably into your life? \n\nI think this is a common consequentialist thought in this dialectic. And of course it is right: nobody ever promised that whatever we end up calling \"morality\" couldn't be alienating.  But if you read the Williams, you'll find that this just raises the further question: why should I care about this thing you're calling \"morality\", if it is going to threaten every source of meaning and purpose I have in my life?  No consequentialist has ever, to my knowledge, answered this question.  \n\nNow, to your credit, you try to make a start on this, by arguing that consequentialist morality has a kind of aesthetic value that can call to us and give our lives purpose.  But your characterization of consequentialism in those passages strays very far from the theory itself.  You say \"morality calls on us to care, to really support the good things and really oppose the bad things.\"  But plenty of non-consequentialists think that this is so as well, that any sane morality requires us to get out of our comfort zones and try to make the world a better place.  The idea that this thought is owned by the consequentialist is frankly quite silly.\n\nWhat the consequentialist *says* is that that we must, *among all of our options, select the course of action that will maximize the good*.  A person who reaches out and supports a good thing when they *could* have supported an even better thing **fails morally** by this standard.  So I send money to Ukraine, thinking I'm doing right, but the consequentialist says: actually you could have sent money to Syria, and you could have sent more, so you technically did not do the right thing.\n\nYou ask: \"Do you really want to be without higher aspirations?\"  Of course not.  What I don't want is for that aspiration to be \"maximize the good\".  That is an insane aspiration that no-one can or should have.\n\nIn sum, it is only by straying away from the nature of consequentialism, and by recasting it as some uncontroversial homespun wisdom about doing some good in the world, that this attempt to bring it closer to us can work.  In reality, it is an utterly inaccessible doctrine that no person has ever lived by, not the least because there is no way to know what all of your options are.",

People do things which seem nasty for their families, but *within* the experience of that person there is something beautiful or meaningful. In an ER, you just see someone's husband screaming and yelling at people, but in his experience something which holds all the importance in the world \n\nIn media with the \"I did it for my family\" trope, whats often implied or outright stated is that the character who \"did it for his family\" doesn't actually understand what his family wants or needs.

And the departments where it would count against you--they definitely exist--aren't ones you want to work in.\n\nYou still need letters of recommendation. If you think there are 2-3 professors who will still write strong letters of rec. even after reporting someone (and I sincerely hope your advisor falls into that category), then do it. If not, you have a very difficult decision to make. I've been on selection committees, and we're always cognizant of those sorts of issues but if they don't have letters or rec. from their current institution, that will raise questions even if the applicant has a good explanation. I'd like to think we resolved the issues well when it came up for those committees, but I'm not sure every selection committee will do the same.\n\nI'd like to say report them. But I know that's not always the best long-term decision for your career. It's shitty. No one should have to go through that. You also need to recognize that it's about your full life, not just your career. The best career decision isn't necessarily the best decision. The best I can say is that, in my experience, those sexist folks are the minority by a wide margin. And if they're not the minority at your institution, there are a lot of departments where they are and even where they barely exist because those schools don't (intentionally) hire that sort of people.",

Previous versions have relied on a hedonistic theory of value and stated that suffering should be minimized. The traditional rebuttal is that the doctrine in this form morally requires us to end all sentient life. To avoid this, a need-based theory of value is introduced. The frustration of the needs not to suffer and not to have one’s autonomy dwarfed should, prima facie, be decreased. When decreasing the need frustration of some would increase the need frustration of others, the case is deferred and a fuller ethical analysis is conducted. The author’s perceptions on murder, extinction, the right to die, antinatalism, veganism, and abortion are used to reach a reflective equilibrium. The new theory is then applied to consumerism, material growth, and power relations. The main finding is that the burden of proof should be on those who promote the status quo.",

Check the journals of *recent* papers that you admire, that you would be happy to have gotten published, and that are on a similar topic to your paper(s). Then search the journal name and key phrases like \"response time\",  \"rejection rate\", \"comments\", etc., to compare which journals have shorter response times and are more likely to give you comments. As a grad student, it is crucial to hear back in less than a year. A couple months is better. And it is important to be able to get comments and not simply get desk-rejected (though that will happen too, and you shouldn't feel bad!), so that you can improve. Finally, I would say, aim as high as you think you can (maybe a touch higher if your self-esteem has been nuked like mine has!). Also, if you are publishing in a specialized area (e.g., logic, philosophy of some special science, history of philosophy) then specialist journals in your area don't necessarily need to be like a top-25 journal overall. \n\nBTW, the APA and some blogs have good resources.

You obviously have an area of specialization, so sign up to Google scholar alerts to be notified of new publications in your area. When you see a paper that you you could reply to, write a short reply. I let this dictate the journal. Get a friend to look it over, and submit. I've submitted two replies in two weeks to papers I disagree with. 900 words and 2000 words. I have a 1500 word response I'm working on. Within a few months you should have a couple of papers under review.",

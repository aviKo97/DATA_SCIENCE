Typically, what you do is suffer through the first one, and then there's a setting called something along the lines of Memory Context Restore that saves that calibration for next time in most AM5 BIOS now - it's technically less stable, but for just gaming and such it's a pretty easy choice. \n\nIt sounds like you have a simultaneous problem with hitting your memory speeds as well, which means it might be defaulting to running at the bare minimum speeds after a couple of failed boot attempts. Did you enable XMP/EXPO in the BIOS? Most RAM comes with a default speed (often called its JEDEC speed) and then you have to turn on XMP/EXPO in the BIOS to hit its rated speed, since it's technically an overclock and they don't want you to get stuck if the rated speed doesn't work. The 4x48GB is actually going to hurt you here, though, because running 4 sticks, especially 4 high-density sticks, is much more intensive for the memory controller than two - which means you often need to drop to a lower speed for it to handle the load. So first, try it with just two sticks, turn on EXPO and Memory Context Restore in the BIOS, and see if that works. If so, add the other two sticks (or, I'll be honest, don't, 96GB is already laughably overkill for a gaming setup) and see if they can manage it as well.",

What you *do* want is your graphics card usage to be as near 100% as possible in games. I'd suggest using msi afterburner to get the on screen overlay with your performance numbers. If your gpu is anything below like 98% then you should turn up resolution (but dont exceed your monitors native res) and/or settings. For one, you want to do that because lower usage on gpu means that you're leaving performance on the table, and the more you increase settings, the workload goes from cpu to gpu. Most games I play range from 15% to 50% cpu usage, all with 98-100% gpu usage and between 12gb to 20gb ram used. That's the best way to get a stutter-free, smooth, responsive gaming experience\n\nEdit for clarity: you have a fairly capable system, i think you just need to tune settings better. I have a 7800x3d and 3070 with 32gb ddr5, and I get 100-180+fps in everything I play in 1440p. Use dlss quality, use your native resolution, use high or ultra settings, and you should have a solid gaming experience with the hardware you have",

Processor A does it in 30s while consuming 200W. Processor B does it in 45s while consuming 100W.  Processor B was more efficient, but A was faster. In a case like this, you need to decide which is more important to you.\n\n\nNow imagine Precessor A did it in 20s vs. 45s for processor B. Now Processor A is more efficient despite consuming twice as much power because it took less than half as much time. Assuming both have similar idle power, or a near 100% workload, this is why real power efficiency is a bit more complex than just the max power draw. A lot of improvements in performance and battery life on mobile devices has been achieved through this concept of getting the processing done quickly and returning to a low power state ASAP. (It can affect the cooling you need as well, but unless you're trying to custom build a small form-factor machine that isn't normally relevant, and I'd advised cooling sufficient for a sustained heavy workload.)\n\n\nFor desktop useage and productivity, you mostly only care about performance. If you want a home server or such that is on 24/7, then idle power and efficiency become factors that may have a non-negligible impact on your electric bill.

Because it seemed to be working okay, I didn't take any action but to keep an eye on it.\n\nSometime later, the notice of the incompatibility that I read on the ASRock site went away, and I assumed that the compatibility issue had already been fixed in a BIOS update.\n\nLast year, unaware that the compatibility issue was related to the M.2 slot, I moved the SN850X from the PCIe adapter to the B450M Pro4's M.2 slot. I partitioned it, restored my files to it, and it's currently running today seemingly without any issues.\n\nI've tried to recall this history as accurately as I can remember it.  I'm unsure why my SN850X works in my B450M Pro4's M.2 slot, but if there's anything that I can confirm or test about my system, just ask.",

        "body": "Yeah, **almost** everything here is fine. \n\n750 PSU will likely be fine for now and future too. Corsair remains a great manufacturer. \n\nThe case is likely going to feel bigger IRL than how it looks in pictures. (certainly wider) It's more designed towards builds with AIO coolers than pure air coolers but will work either way. If you haven't built in 10 years you're going to be blown away by how easy it is now. If you're budget conscious though, maybe take a look at one of the Fractal Meshify cases. Should be cheaper, with better airflow and note quite as much of a wideboy. Though again, almost all cases are leagues ahead of where they were last time you put a driver to screw. \n\nThere's a little chart at the bottom of this page that explains the difference between a 9070 and 9070 XT https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/desktops/radeon.html But in practise it comes down to 9070 XT being bigger better faster. I think there may be a dependence on having PCIE 5.0 support to make the most of the XT but your covered there, so no worries. \n\nFor manufacturing, the big differences are the coolers themselves, both in terns of how big/how many fans they have but also in how they were built how well they attach to the chips they are cooling. Better cooling normally means the cards can be overclocked higher in factory and this is reflected in the price and naming schemes. Sapphire tends to be mostly on the solid performing are of mid. Their PURE range just a little higher than PULSE but honestly, you'll not notice much difference. \n\nThe only part I'd question would be the *RAM*. AMD used to be pretty finicky about using compatible ram on their boards. They aren't as bad as they were but it's still a problem. Always check the compatibility guide on the motherboard website. I've linked yours below. The RAM you chose isn't listed. Doesn't mean it won't work, just that if it gives you problems you'll know why. It's worth spending a little bit more on a RAM with higher clock speeds and similar timing like these \"CMH32GX5M2X6600C32 ver 5.43.13\"\n\nhttps://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/B850-GAMING-X-WIFI6E/support#support-memsup",

The MB premium isn't there anymore, and the prices have come down a lot. 32GB DDR5 6000mhz can be had around $60 if you watch for sale or $75 all the time.\n\nThe AM4/AM5 sales recently have caught my interest, but I'm not quite ready to embrace AMD.

Radeon 7000 series still dont have FSR 4 and FSR 3 is just unusable\n4. 5070 is better in pure raster, has DLSS 4 which is also supported in more games than FSR 4 and has better video encoders and better support for productivity tasks\n\nOverall, the 5070 is more worth it, people tend to hate it because they compare it to the 4070 Super but they dont compare the 5070 to its price competitors which are the 7800 XT and the 7900 GRE (the 9070 is almost always more expensive than the 5070 so it doesnt count) and its not a bad card",

I'd prioritize getting a good, quiet intake fan like the Phanteks T30 or a Silent Wings Pro 4 on the bottom, give it its own fan header and making it more aggressive via the bios. This should help keep your GPU cooler under load. If you're using an AIO as the intake you can make the rear another intake and then have just the top be the only exhaust. This should help keep your motherboard cooler. Get a dust filter for the back too.",

Also keep in mind that 4060 ti is better suited to 1080p, it can do well on some titles at 1440p also but will struggle sometimes. If you're on 1080p and go with the 4060 ti you will be fine and can play it smoothly and I risk saying you can even play without DLSS and still be above 60 FPS.",

It competed with the lower tiers of Intel integrated graphics. So, you've got $500, and a new video card under that is launching tomorrow, making two new ones in the last few weeks. Now, I'm not generally endorsing UserBenchmark, nor saying you need a RX 9060 XT (launching tomorrow) or 5060 Ti. I'm just saying this is approximately how much better a sub-$500 card can be, today, than the GT 710, which was probably like $30, brand new:\n\nhttps://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GeForce-GT-710-vs-AMD-RX-9060-XT/m77649vsm2417253\n\nhttps://gpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Nvidia-GeForce-GT-710-vs-Nvidia-RTX-5060-Ti/m77649vs4183\n\nOver 40 times faster. At various used prices, a RX 6600 XT, 6650 XT, 7600 XT, or 7700 XT, might be good. Or, a RTX 3060, 3060 Ti, 3070, 3070 Ti, 4060, or 4060 Ti. You could even go lower and older, but I think you may start getting to the point where you risk buying a card that may have parts on it fail sooner rather than later.\n\nIs the RAM 2x8GB? If not, grab a 3600CL18 32GB kit, and replace it, for like $50. Your CPU is probably good for a few more years, yet, playing older and/or indie games.\n\nNow, if you happen to live near a Microcenter, taking tomorrow morning off sick, to grab a new RX 9060 XT at launch MSRP might well be worth doing (maybe add a memory upgrade, while you're there).",

So in my opinion it's worth investing in the CPU and cooler combo so that they can stay in there a long time.\n\nThe GPU is very easy to replace and in general doesn't lose its value very fast so you can experiment with that a bid and buy something else if you're not happy with what you have.\n\nIf you are going with an Nvidia card, DLSS will definitely help to produce high fps while upscaling to 1440p.\n\nIf you are going for an AMD GPU, you get the AMD CPU and GPU synergie which is called Smart Acces Memory (SAM). That should boost GPU performance about 15%\n\nOverall for 1440p and higher i think Nvidia DLSS performs the best.\nYou can try to search on YT for your card + Cyberpunk on 1440p and see test results.\nAlso, Chatgpt helped me a lot when I was building my pc a couple weeks ago.\n\nGood luck and have fun!",

It's stupidly overpriced and doesn't perform that well in any regard besides having a compact design and cover for SFF cases. Which is probably the only reason you would want it. unless you want to make a be quiet fanboy set up (which is fine). \n\nAnyway, this is a beast computer for your kid and honestly you're probably overkilling it considering genshin impact is frame capped at 60 fps lmao. But if she ever decides to game anything else this will still be overkill so yeah, you're building a beast.\n\nthe 64gb ram is overkill, but also on the slower side. Look for 6000 cl30 or 32 as AMD is pretty picky about RAM if you want the system to feel buttery smooth during usage.\n\nGPU is probably the main concern as you picked a 9070 xt at MSRP which don't exist anymore so not sure how you're gonna pull it off for that price. You should be expecting to add another \\~$100-200 for that type of quality. The GPU you pick should depend on the resolution she will be playing at (now and in the future). If your girl is just playing lower end games and using it to consume media, I'd recommend nvidia 5070 over the 9070 xt so she can use the features. All the cards will be fine for 1080 or 1440p gaming, so the only question is whether or not she will be gaming at 4k anytime soon. 5070ti would probably be the most futureproof option at the price range and you can get it for \\~$750 if you keep your eye out for stock. Same with the 9070 XT for like \\~$700, but imo it's not worth that price. \n\nStorage is overkill getting the pro, but it does come with provable quality, so if you wanna make sure she ssds that don't degrade at all over \\~5-years then I guess that's fine to pay extra. (it can always still degrade though lmao). It's still stupid fast for just gaming and general usage though.",

Rather than pay the i7 premium for an already obsolete upgrade, you could go to LGA 1200 (which is already obsolete as well, but four to five generations newer than what you're working with) and get an i5-10400 or i5-11400, which would absolutely trounce a Kaby Lake i7 while using much less power, but you can use the same RAM and even the same cooler you're using now.

Personally I would not worry about getting a cpu that's \"too strong\", you never want cpu to go to 100% usage because games/apps will stutter. You always want gpu to be as close to 100% usage as possible or else you're leaving performance on the table. \n\nI chose the 7800x3d because I got a great deal on it (Micro Center bundle), its second only to the 9800x3d in gaming performance, and the AM5 socket will have new cpus made for it through 2027 so there'll be tons of room to upgrade on my motherboard if I ever want to. \n\nIntel is nowhere near as good as it used to be, massive thermal issues and stability problems with 13th and 14th gen cpus. Degradation and eventually stopping working is pretty common. I used intel forever until now and I have zero regrets, their cpus have gone to shit the past few years. \n\nAnyway my logic is that usually cpus end up where you have to get a new board to get a newer cpu so I just got the best one I could get. Surprisingly my performance went up even more than expected because I was so cpu bottlenecked before. So you'll probably get a lot more fps out of your card if your cpu is going to 100% usage. \n\nYou can also upgrade your card for pretty cheap on the used market. 3070s go for like $200-300 now and they're great for 1440p ultra in 2025 so it would be more than capable of gaming at 1080p. \n\nI would highly suggest getting a 144hz monitor, refresh rate physically limits the fps that is displayed to you. By playing on 60hz you cannot see more than 60fps even if your fps counter says its above 60. I use 165hz and my 3070 is perfect for that",

It looks like there are some case fans on your build that get plugged into a USB header, meaning you won't be able to plug all the ports on your case's front IO panel, so some of the front panel ports will be unusable, or unusable without adapters.\n\nNotes C and E are just standard disclaimers that PCPP issues and I wouldn't worry much about them. It basically just means the site's database doesn't have data to verify whether these potential problems will be actual problems or not. They're more of a heads up than anything.\n\nYou don't need an AIO to cool a 9600x, and definitely not such an expensive one. I'd get a cheaper one, or even go with a sub-£20 air cooler like this one: https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/product/jvjv6h/thermalright-assassin-x-refined-se-argb-cpu-cooler-ax120r-se-argb-d6-cad\n\nIf you don't actually need the extra features of a B850 motherboard then you could get a lower-cost B650. If this is just for gaming, you almost definitely don't need the extra features.\n\nDDR4-6400 CL32 memory has only a tiny CPU performance boost with an AM5 CPU over DDR5-6000 CL30 memory, and is quite a bit more expensive.\n\nThere is almost no perceptible difference when gaming between a high-end SSD and a mid-tier one, or even a lower performance/cheaper one.

It's a top-of-the-line PSU and being rated for 850W means you will have a good amount of available headroom if you decide later on to do some upgrades. One rated for 750W is enough for your current build, but upgrading later could mean you need to replace it.",

If any of them are dead on arrival you won't know until after the return window has closed.\n\nTo give you specific suggestions on your build:\n\n* The 7700X and 7600X perform similarly in games. Save some money and buy the 7600X\n* Buy the cheapest DDR5-6000 CL30 kit you can find. That's often Patriot.\n* SSD: Try to buy a 1TB NVMe drive. Installing games on an HDD is an awful experience.\n* Cooler: Noctua is good but overpriced. Look into the Thermalright Assassin King to save you some money.\n* GPU: If it all possible, try to buy a GPU with more than 8GB of VRAM. The Intel B580 or Radeon RX 9060 XT 16GB are both good options if you can find them at a reasonable price.",

        "body": "Hi! I have a similar RX 570 build that I am looking forward to upgrading out of. I've been watching the PC hardware markets for a few months now, and a lot has changed.\n\nFirst off, will it be able to run CS2? Yes. Nowadays, for these comp games, you could easily get 150+ fps in 1080p med-high with the 5060. However.......... theres the 5060. Personally, I wouldn't buy any Nvidia card lower than the 5070 new. For just $50 more, you can get the AMD 9060xt which has 2x the vram (important nowadays), as well as similar if not better performance (I havent looked into it much).\n\nThe main advantage of Nvidia is DLSS, and in some situations raytracing. Personally, I hate raytracing, and DLSS is not supported in 80% of the games I play, so AMD always wins, especially with price to performance. Speaking of price to performance, since you are working to get the money for this, you probably want all the performance for your dollar. I would go with the 9060xt, or at least look into it!\n\nNext, CPU. The 7700x is an excellent CPU, that has all the cores u need, at a good price. Nowadays you can get it around \\~$270, which is probably one of my favorite CPUs. I like the 9700x a lil more, since a bit more perforamnce for \\~20-30 more, but that's just me. As for the 7700 vs 7700x, I would go with the x just for the extra lil bit of power, it does come in handy.\n\nAnd as for your SP games, it should do fine 1080p in most games. It really depends on your resolution that you want to play at. Most of those games, (far crys, rdr, mafias) are older that dont need as high performance hardware, so you should be able to get around 1440p 60fps. A good benchmark is take the performance of ur current pc, multiply it \\~2-2.5x (with a 5060 that is probably what you will get), and that will be your performance.\n\nLastly, if you want to squeeze every last dollar out, consider bumping down to a ryzen 5 9600x, which is zen 5, has 6c/12t and is still good in gaming. that way you could possibly bump that gpu up to say a 5070 or 9070 if you would like.\n\nIf you'd like,I can give you more advice if you let me know your target budget and resolution in your games!\n\nHope this helps :)",

That being said Samsung has the best reputation and makes their own panels, so in theory it should be the most reliable, but it could just be a case of paying for a well known brand.",

The 9950X3D is only worth it if you also do productivity work like video editing.\n\n9950X3D would be best with a 360mm aio. 9800X3D is fine under an inexpensive dual tower air cooler, such as a thermalright phantom spirit.\n\nIf you're going for overkill, get 2x32 gb of ram for a total of 64 gb.\n\n5080 is fine if you're gaming at 4k. If it's just 1440p, a 5070 ti would be plenty.\n\nA 1000 watt ATX 3.1 PSU A tier or better from this list would be best.

        "body": "Potentially, this is where the courts start gaining ground and turning this bullshit back. Trump and company don't realize that if you give an inch, the Justice system will take a mile legally. Trump probably is thinking that doing this will \"get them off his back\" and it is performative without realizing the legal consequences of following a court order related to their immigration policies and actions. Now that he has done this for one person, why not the others? Blood in the water, and the judges are sharks. Compound this with Miller losing his ever-living shit at ICE agents and DHS signals that they know they are losing this fight and the end-state is all but inevitable. Their goal was to blitzkrieg deportations and renditions so fast that the court system and any agencies to keep them in check would be unable to respond fast enough, turns out that takes a shit load of man-power and money to make happen, and the scale and speed at which they needed to move to pull it off is virtually impossible. Consider they just raised the ICE Agent quota to 3,000 arrests ***PER DAY*** out of anger with the slow results. Imagine having to not only arrest and process 3,000 people ***PER DAY*** but also ***find*** said people to arrest and deport. The previous quota of 1,200 per day was already infeasible, now they want to over double that. They're also going to be penalizing agents not meeting this quota, further souring morale against this administration. I swear, Trump just fundamentally does not understand how people work and that making enemies faster than you can make allies is not way to become a dictator.",

I'm talking about the real owners now, the real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They’ve long since bought and paid for the senate, the congress, the state houses, the city halls, they got the judges in their back pockets and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all of the news and information you get to hear. They got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: They don’t want a population of citizens capable of critical thinking. They don’t want well informed, well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. That doesn’t help them. Thats against their interests. Thats right. They don’t want people who are smart enough to sit around a kitchen table to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. They don’t want that. You know what they want? They want obedient workers. Obedient workers. People who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork, and just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, the reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it, and now they’re coming for your Social Security money. They want your retirement money. They want it back so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street, and you know something? They’ll get it. They’ll get it all from you, sooner or later, 'cause they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain’t in it.”",

They don't read them because they don't need to, they just need to know if the billionaires who regularly fill their campaign coffers want it to pass or not.\n\nWelcome to life in a plutocracy/plutonomy/oligarchy.

In a post to his Substack, Walsh wrote, “Three words I never thought I’d ever utter: I’m a Democrat.”\n\n“The stakes are simply too high to NOT become a Democrat. Let me explain why,” he wrote. “Let’s start with the obvious—a tyrant sits in the White House. The very thing our Founders feared most is here.”\n\nWalsh said he was still the “same passionate TEA partier who went to Congress in 2010 to fight against our out-of-control debt and fight for a more efficient government.\"\n\n“I’m still a border hawk, an unabashed gun rights advocate, and an unyielding defender of free speech,” he wrote, but added “I’ve opened my eyes and listened to people who don’t think like me. And by doing so, I gained a greater understanding of and appreciation for LGBTQ issues, structural racism, the need for empathetic immigration reform, the dangers of climate change, and the role government must play to help care for the neediest and most vulnerable among us.”\n\nWalsh served in the House representing an Illinois congressional district from 2011-2013. He has been an outspoken critic of Trump for the last seven years.\n\nWalsh was a supporter of Trump early in his first administration, but later turned critical of him about halfway through Trump’s first term. He launched an unsuccessful primary challenge to Trump in 2020 and left the Republican Party shortly thereafter, endorsing former President Joe Biden for president.\n\n“I’m still a conservative, but I’m not a conservative jerk. For the past seven years, I’ve been on a mission to help heal the divide in this country—the divide I helped to create,” Walsh wrote.\n\n“Decency, tolerance, understanding, empathy...I now get how vital these all are to our politics, and there’s only one political party these days that values and practices these traits—the Democratic Party,” he wrote. “Donald Trump is the worst of us, and, sadly, the rest of the Republican Party emulates his cruelty, dishonesty, and authoritarianism.”",

They exemplify every little speck of the “weakness” that they’ve been accusing us of, while having absolutely no self-awareness about it. Apparently, trans folks and allies are just supposed to be nice about being excluded from society and denied evidence-based supports.\n\nAnyway, keep being mean to Nazis.\n\nEDIT: I just want to thank the person who came in and tried to argue with a bunch of people about what is and isn't Nazism, in order to support that it's wrong of me to call a Nazi a Nazi - thank you for demonstrating exactly what I was talking about. \n\nBecause the confusion here seems to be that leftists (and maybe a fraction do, I'll allow for that) actually enjoy walking around and calling people racist or transphobic just for shits and giggles the same way that a lot of people on the right seem to enjoy throwing around the insults that I listed above as if we're all playing team sports and they want to win. I think the difference is that most of us would be happy to stop having to describe behavior that is happening. I've never called someone a racist just because they grew up being told to vote R, even if I wish they self-reflected more on the policies they are supporting. I have called people a racist for saying and doing racist things. Same thing with transphobia. And I will not stop. \n\nAnd unfortunately, the right is giving us a lot of material to work with lately, as far it pertains to the Nazi label. \n\nFurthermore, it is not a centrist position to want to \"debate\" someone's right to exist or participate in society. It is a radical and hostile position, and it is appropriate that it be met with equal force.",

On Monday, the FBI asked for tips on doctors or hospitals “who mutilate under the guise of gender-affirming care,” which refers to surgical intervention for trans youth. But the “criminals” the Trump administration is hunting may not even exist — every major American health organization is firm that surgical intervention does not happen for children under 12, and is incredibly rare for minors between 15 and 17.  Since this tip line seems most likely to target providers and programs helping trans youth with non-invasive therapies — even as the Trump administration threatens to remove funding — people are onrushing the line with incredibly demeaning and foul-mouthed comments, according to two sources familiar with the matter and a recording shared with Rolling Stone.\n\nRead more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trans-youth-health-care-fbi-tip-line-1235354963/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trans-youth-health-care-fbi-tip-line-1235354963/)",

I firmly believe it just gives these weirdos an excuse to talk about kids genitals and maybe engage in some internet surfing under the guise of “research” into the topic. Because I cannot come with any other logical reason to be this concerned about minors receiving medical gender affirming care when the numbers of children getting such care is minuscule. \n\nWhy do they only care about these kids but not the tens of millions of children who are food insecure, homeless, in the foster care system, on Medicaid, or have no health insurance? Why to they only care about this kids in which genitals can be the conversation?\n\nAll my questions are rhetorical because I know why. Keep these weirdos away from your kids.",

E.g. if this happened and then Dems had a clean sweep in 2028, there's a near 100% chance Republicans would rush to re-instate the debt ceiling before Dems took office. Context matters.",

Every single reference to the vessel going forward needs to be reviewed and updated to ensure it’s properly identified. Their bigotry is not just morally repugnant, it’s fiscally irresponsible.",

Twenty-five per cent? Fifty per cent? Hardly anyone knows the answer.\n\nEven the most avid newspaper reader will have lost count. [US tariff levels ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/tariffs?srsltid=AfmBOooKzHIt8SclLRA0sGLdLJTtwX11xTIsPoj2FO0QurMo4fGYK0zb&ico=in-line_link)now have the same volatility as share prices. You could check them in the afternoon and find an entirely new number to what you found in the morning.\n\nThe reason for that is simple and profound, with historic implications. The US is now a joke country. It is a laughing stock. There is no predictability to its actions or sense to its decisions. It has dissolved into mania and reactionary psychosis.\n\n[Donald Trump ](https://inews.co.uk/topic/donald-trump?ico=in-line_link)first announced tariffs of 25 per cent on steel and aluminium imports on 10 February, with a one-month delay until they kicked in. Then, on 2 April, comically referred to by the administration as [“liberation day”](https://inews.co.uk/news/key-questions-trumps-tariffs-in-under-five-minutes-3621048?ico=most_popular&srsltid=AfmBOorV1J8Qbx7NBQiHazb36UyG0gPktLk_vazv4Po0zOiYGB-0Rtim), he imposed a 10 per cent baseline tariff on all goods and a range of madcap additional tariffs based on whatever fantasyland equations his allies had dreamed up.\n\nAfter a week of market panic, he then buckled and backed down on some tariffs, but retained them for China. Then, once he realised China held escalation advantage in any possible [trade war](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/peter-frankopan-trump-declared-war-china-history-end-quickly-3637076?srsltid=AfmBOopD9e5cW4uWeWP9X-KIjd_66g5sFzQ7ui4m8fxcjV6hDvTfn3qt&ico=in-line_link), he backed down on that plan, as well.\n\nMeanwhile, he [threatened the EU](https://inews.co.uk/news/world/eu-counting-trump-blink-first-trade-spat-3715252?ico=in-line_link) with a 20 per cent tariff, then cut it to 10 per cent, then had a tantrum and said he’d raise it to 50 per cent, then said he’d delay the deadline because he had a “very nice” call with the head of the European Commission. He is a child with a gun – poking things with it, pushing peas into it, using it as a hat, and eventually, I suppose, by law of statistical probability, accidentally firing it.",

I'm sure she has some input of some kind, but it's likely minimal. Joe Biden? well, that's pretty obvious. I don't say that without empathy for his situation.\n\nBut the Dems just bring it on themselves. The truly patriot Cortez (AOC) was the obvious great choice for chair of the HOC, but the Dems/Pelosi denied that. They are just running into their holes.

It is amusing to watch the number of shocked Pikachu faces growing week by week but at the same time it's sad and tragic because they've already screwed the country by voting for him, and now as they are experiencing the #Awakening it's kinda almost too late. Sure the midterms are next year but Trump may shove the country's head so far under water that the situation may become unrecoverable.",

[PBS warned the world about Project 2025 back in August, 2024.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fact-checking-warnings-from-democrats-about-project-2025-and-donald-trump)\n\nAnd wouldn't you know, PBS did a similar segment [highlighting Kamala Harris' attempts to bring attention to Project 2025 during a National Debate that was televised live](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/nx-s1-5107958/project-2025-fact-check-donald-trump-kamala-harris-debate-2024)- I remember because [Trump wildly claimed that California aborts babies at 9 months](https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-claims-abortion-nine-months-130040483.html)... and the moderator was grilled for fact-checkimg that claim.\n\nI hear that some people think Dems didn't do a good job of getting this message out, but it was all over the news cycle and social media circles leading up to the election.\n\nPersonally, I say the failure to warn against P2025 is on progressives who ignored the project because Biden was still offering bombs for a genocide, and because Lib Dems (as opposed to progressives) are addicted to billionaire biases. Righties either loved Project 2025 or chalked it up to liberal hyperbole (surprise! Not hyperbole!).\n\nProgressives failed to show up because they didn't see representation from dems, and I bet most didn't think that Project 2025 would have been stopped by having a dem president, considering the current composition of the house.",

He made the right decision here, although it took a long time.\n\n>The judge wrote that “significant evidence” has surfaced indicating that many of the migrants imprisoned in El Salvador are not connected to the gang “and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.”\n\nYes, this is true, but these people have been imprisoned for over two months. Not sure why it took this long to come to this conclusion and issue this ruling.\n\n>Boasberg gave the administration one week to come up with a manner in which the “at least 137\" people can make those claims, even while they’re formally in the custody of El Salvador. \n\nOkay, what happens if the administration does not do it within a week?",

That education—funded by taxpayers—is valued in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. According to *The Gazette*, Marquez was later told by Air Force officials that if he is involuntarily separated, he won’t be billed. But the message was clear: his government does not want him in uniform.\n\n>And yet, there is no question he met the standard. “We want warfighters. We want people with grit, that are resilient. They have done all that,” a U.S. Air Force Academy staff member told *The Gazette*, speaking anonymously for fear of retaliation. All three cadets passed physical fitness tests for both men and women. All three graduated with distinction.\n\n>What disqualifies them is not their performance but their identity.\n\n>Marquez is a plaintiff in *Talbott v. United States*, one of the central legal challenges to the policy. In a sworn statement, he wrote that the executive order describes people like him as “undisciplined, selfish, and dishonest.” “None of those are correct descriptions of my character or my abilities,” he wrote. “I have achieved alongside my peers throughout my time at the Academy.”\n\n>The policy is not theoretical. It is personal. \n\n>Academy alumni have responded with solidarity. Nearly 1,000 graduates have signed an open letter defending transgender cadets and midshipmen. “Being transgender is in no way incompatible with any of our Academies’ cherished virtues and values,” the letter reads, [according to](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/31/no-way-incompatible-service-academy-alums-sign-letter-supporting-transgender-cadets-midshipmen.html) Military.com.\n\nSo, trans people are too good at sports but unfit the military, according to Republicans?\n\n  \nFascist doublespeak in action.

The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that a total of 10.9[ million people](https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/c398b0e7-5b57-4fc7-aa63-4c8b4c815bce/jec-fact-sheet-on-district-level-impacts-of-health-care-cuts.pdf) will lose health insurance by 2034 if the current bill becomes law and Congress allows cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act Marketplace to go through. An [additional 5.1 million people ](https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-06/Wyden-Pallone-Neal_Letter_6-4-25.pdf)would lose coverage because the bill fails to extend tax credits for ACA Marketplace plans, and Health and Human Services has proposed new rules limiting the program’s enrollment periods and making other changes, bringing the total to 16 million.\"\n\n\"The estimate of 51,000 preventable deaths is based on details from a[ previous analysis](https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/cbo-emails-re-e%26c-reconcilation-scores-may-11%2C-2025.pdf) from CBO, which initially found that 13.7 million people would lose their health care coverage by 2034. Since CBO has now revised that estimate to be higher in response to [queries](https://democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/democrats-energycommerce.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/cbo.2025.5.5.letter-re-request-for-cbo-analysis-of-aca-subsidies-and-reconcilliation-003%29.pdf) from Democrats, the estimate of 51,000 deaths could, in fact, be an undercount.\"\n\n\"The latest calculations from public health experts adds to a [growing](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/opioid-deaths-are-falling-though-proposed-medicaid-changes-could-disrupt-access-to-treatment/?utm_campaign=KFF-Medicaid&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8VS-O4MRnL4aG873-MNvq4bv0ltDnOIAlkuc5Jk_LmIen0tlCQj6jLu1BMZb_cjqdE7s1wrJpj7ST5E6FAdJdTbpIFUA&_hsmi=363938791&utm_content=363938791&utm_source=hs_email) pile of [research](https://www.kff.org/policy-watch/implementing-work-requirements-on-a-national-scale-what-we-know-from-state-waiver-experience/?utm_campaign=KFF-Medicaid&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8OLrQXM7GoWfddHo3lMgCNVu68XgYMIg02nhZMub5K370a0_9npNh5myunpoSZtZX2_t64OlHniPjq6GKL0g6P8_o0kg&_hsmi=363938791&utm_content=363938791&utm_source=hs_email) on the [devastating potential impacts](https://www.kff.org/quick-take/house-bill-would-penalize-more-states-for-covering-immigrants-including-lawfully-residing-children-and-pregnant-people/?utm_campaign=KFF-Medicaid&utm_medium=email&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-9EqOYNCDIWTvaEq8YcTJw3h7ArwgCd49DTBDqXr_-bLIhf9vLvxOVNNG0cczkqGFgiyDQBnb0u5Tm539nPA1scOkzOxg&_hsmi=363938791&utm_content=363938791&utm_source=hs_email) of budget cuts, which Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing for to cover tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the wealthy.

Ernst’s flippant comments over the weekend reveal a grim reality: Republicans in Congress know that their tax bill will rip away lifesaving health care from their constituents, jeopardizing lives just to pad billionaires’ pockets … and they just don’t care,” said Kobie Christian, a spokesperson for the economic justice campaign Unrig Our Economy, in a statement.\n\n“In the wealthiest country in the world, we should be guaranteeing health care to all as a human right, not taking health care away from millions of seniors and working families to pay for tax breaks for billionaires,” Sanders said.\"",

On Wednesday afternoon, as Musk was continuing to attack the bill on Twitter/X, Trump used his [Truth Social](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump) platform to [repost a tweet from Musk thanking Trump for letting him oversee the DOGE project](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114626394056454893).\n\nBut he has yet to weigh in directly on Musk's criticism.\n\nWhen a Fox News reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt [\"how mad\" Trump would be](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6373837132112) when he learned about Musk's comments, she had a restrained answer ready: \"The president already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill. It doesn't change the president's opinion. This is one big, beautiful bill, and he's sticking to it.\"\n\nAnd when I asked the White House press office for comment Wednesday morning, they referred me to Leavitt's previous statement.\n\nObvious conclusion: For now, at least, the Trump team is going out of its way not to stoke a feud with Musk.\n\nIt seems very unlikely that Trump's silence is going to be permanent: Trump loves holding forth in front of the press, so someone's going to ask him about it at some point.\n\nStill, this level of what seems to be restraint is remarkable for a man who doesn't usually restrain himself, and who loathes people who poke at him in public. What's happening?\n\n[Read more](https://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-elon-musk-budget-bill-response-attack-explained-why-2025-6?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=insider-politics-sub-post).",

Fugate, who previously interned at the Heritage Foundation, oversees the government’s main hub for terrorism prevention, including an $18 million grant program intended to help communities combat violent extremism.\n\nInitially assigned to an immigration office, Fugate's role was expanded to include the Center for Prevention Programs and Partnerships, also known as CP3. The office is tasked with leading nationwide prevention efforts against hate-fueled attacks, school shootings and other forms of targeted violence.\n\nNews of the appointment has trickled out in recent weeks, raising alarm among counterterrorism researchers and nonprofit groups funded by the office. Several said they turned to LinkedIn for intel on Fugate, an unknown in their field. No threat prevention experience is listed in his employment history.\n\n“Maybe he’s a wunderkind. Maybe he’s Doogie Howser and has everything at 21 years old, or whatever he is, to lead the office. But that’s not likely the case,” said one counterterrorism researcher who has worked with CP3 officials for years. “**It sounds like putting the intern in charge**.”\n\nIt’s unclear how much power comes with his new title.\n\nProPublica sent Homeland Security a detailed list of questions about Fugate’s role, his lack of national security experience and the future of the department’s prevention work. A senior DHS official replied with a statement saying only that Fugate’s CP3 duties were added to his role as an aide in an Immigration & Border Security office.\n\nProPublica also sought an interview with Fugate through DHS and the White House, but there was no response.\n\nThe Trump administration rejects claims of a retreat from terrorism prevention, noting partnerships with law enforcement agencies and swift investigations of recent attacks. “The notion that this single office is responsible for preventing terrorism is not only incorrect, it’s ignorant,” spokesperson Abigail Jackson wrote in an email.\n\n**Learn more about the self-described “Trumplican” and his new job**: [https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-thomas-fugate-cp3-terrorism-prevention](https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-dhs-thomas-fugate-cp3-terrorism-prevention)",

The department also cited federal law which they said required accreditors to notify member institutions if they were in noncompliance and establish a plan to bring them back into compliance.\n\n[You can read the full story here.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-04/white-house-threatens-columbia-s-accreditation-over-protests)",

Mary Miller of Illinois, who shared the *Sesame Street* post on her X feed and wrote, “PBS is shamelessly grooming our children while collecting taxpayer dollars. This is evil and should infuriate every parent in America. DEFUND!!” Miller has also introduced a resolution to declare June Family Month instead of Pride Month.\n\n>Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona shared the same clip and commented, “PBS is grooming children on American taxpayers’ dime. This is unacceptable. Congress must defund them and hold the executives accountable.”\n\nMore confirmation of Republicans being genocidal maniacs. They're attacking Sesame Street for simply being accepting of everyone.

The farms in these parts produce a lot of corn and import a bunch of it.  You'd think that, since stores have a large domestic source of corn, it would be \"unaffected by tariffs\".  However, GROWING the corn is drastically impacted by the tariffs.  From fertilizer to farm equipment, most of it comes from outside the US and is directly impacted by tariffs.  Those costs get passed to the farmers who will need to pass it to the suppliers who will pass it to the stores who will pass it to the consumers.  \n\nThat's not to say we're not going to see a lot of gouging and profiteering hiding behind \"oh, it's the tariffs\" excuses.  We saw it during COVID.  We saw it during \"inflation\", with places increasing prices by 30% annually during 6 - 8% inflation.  We saw it as recently as the \"egg prices\" debacle, with producers supposedly devasted by the bird flu egg shortage somehow posting record profits.  \n\nCompanies gonna gouge.  The only way to combat it is to refuse to buy the products being gouged.  The problem is that not enough people are willing to make those sacrifices to cause the gougers pain.  Egg prices increased 300+% in some areas, but they were still sold out as fast as they hit the shelves.  People could've skipped eggs, but refused to, so the prices stayed spiked and have been very slow to come down due to the continued profiteering.",

Guy is an idiot (for instance, Canada would sell Americans raw materials for a number of industries, then buy back a portion when it’s refined, at full market value, as soon as they set up their own refining of said raw materials, USA is out of the loop, and may even be forced to buy Canada’s refined materials. He actually said USA was subsidizing Canada in this type of trade- this sounds to me like he’s just fucking up those American industries that were making out like bandits)",

He doesn't like the fact that Harvard, which pre-dates the United States itself, teaches foreign students, and hosts foreign researchers. And what he really doesn't like is the fact that they don't acquiesce to his petulant demands by changing their establishment to fit with his personal desire to control higher education.\n\nTrump would love if Harvard abandoned its mission and became MAGA University, teaching a limited, ideological curriculum that reflected a revised history that fit with the MAGA narrative to a predominantly white, American study body. He's fundamentally opposed to students from other countries (other than Israel) coming to United States for their education. Declaring that Harvard's acceptance of foreign students represents a threat to the United States is objectively preposterous, and a violation of Harvard's right to host qualified students from abroad.

The authorities later claimed they had busted a gathering of members and associates of Tren de Aragua, a violent gang that began in a Venezuelan prison before extending to other parts of Latin America.  \n  \nTwo were arrested on state charges related to drugs. In the only press release to date, authorities said the sting was the result of a yearlong, multi-agency investigation that revealed the gang ties. They said they would release more details “as they become available.”  \n  \nBut two months later, authorities have yet to provide any evidence that the more than three dozen people they arrested that night have connections to the gang. The actions have worried experts who see a troubling pattern of the government violating due process.  \n  \nICE has refused to release the names of who was detained and where they are currently. The Tribune identified 35 of the people apprehended in the raid by reviewing documents provided by DPS in response to public information requests. All 35 were arrested on suspicion of illegally entering the country, a federal violation, and the government intends to deport them, DPS reports show.  \n  \nThe Tribune ran the 35 names found in the DPS records through databases of federal, Travis and Hays County court cases. None of the 35 had previous criminal cases in those jurisdictions, according to that review.  \n  \n“This is about something much bigger,” said Muzaffar Chishti, director of the Migration Policy Institute office at New York University School of Law. “If it happens to a person who is accused of being a (gang member) today, tomorrow it could happen to you and me. And if the alleged member of this gang does not have the right to contest \\[charges against them\\], how can you know I’ll have it? The next person will have it?”",

He was considering it beforehand, but Sunday’s assault put it into motion faster.\n\n\n\nThe White House is touting the new president’s travel ban as “fulfilling” a campaign promise to “protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm.”\n\n“President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information,” White House deputy press secretary Abigail Jackson wrote on X.\n\nTrump said in a video [posted ](https://x.com/WhiteHouse/status/1930412786271547485)Wednesday that new countries could be added to the travel ban as “threats emerge around the world.”\n\n“The list is subject to revision based on whether material improvements are made. And likewise new countries can be added as threats emerge around the world, but we will not allow people to enter our country who wish to do us harm and nothing will stop us from keeping America safe,” the president said.\n\nThe proclamation takes effect at 12:01 AM on June 9, according to the White House.\n\nWednesday’s proclamation comes less than five months after the president was inaugurated into office for his second term. On his first day in office, he issued an executive order directing cabinet members, including the secretary of state, to compile a list of countries “for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.”\n\nIn his first term, Trump barred travelers from seven majority-Muslim nations from coming to the US, a policy that saw court challenges before President Joe Biden repealed it when he took office in 2021.\n\nThe barring of nationals from Afghanistan could impact Afghans who worked alongside the US during its two decades of war there. Tens of thousands of Afghans have already been caught in limbo due to other Trump administration executive orders suspending the US refugee admissions program and the suspension of foreign aid funding for flights of Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders.",

The subtle policy change could lead to an escalation in enforcement tactics and legal disputes.\n\nRevised [policy guidance](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25963599-110724/#document/p1) recently posted to ICE’s website and reviewed by WIRED reveals efforts by the agency to enhance the discretion and autonomy of the federal agents making arrests in and around courthouses—one of the more aggressive initiatives employed by the Trump administration as part of its all-out push to round up migrants across the United States and its territories. The policy revision has not been previously reported.\n\nIn recent weeks, ICE agents have made high-profile arrests of immigrants attending routine court hearings, as part of the administration’s effort to conduct what Trump calls the largest deportation campaign in American history.\n\nThe change in guidance comes amid sweeping ICE raids across the US, some sparking [protests](https://minnesotareformer.com/2025/06/03/hundreds-protest-ice-in-minneapolis/) and [heated confrontations](https://www.npr.org/2025/05/31/nx-s1-5418970/san-diego-immigration-raid-restaurant) with citizens, threatening an erosion of local autonomy and democratic governance over law enforcement operations within communities, while further blurring the line between civil and criminal enforcement.\n\nRead the full story: [https://www.wired.com/story/ice-quietly-scales-back-rules-for-courthouse-raids/](https://www.wired.com/story/ice-quietly-scales-back-rules-for-courthouse-raids/)",

Graham writes: [https://theatln.tc/Kqnyce3G](https://theatln.tc/Kqnyce3G)\n\nReuters reported this week that acting FEMA head David Richardson suggested during a meeting with employees that he was unaware of the very existence of a hurricane season. The Department of Homeland Security dismissed the report and said FEMA is shifting to become a “lean, deployable disaster force.”\n\n“FEMA employees, and Americans at large, might be forgiven for having doubts,” Graham writes. Richardson has been on the job only a few weeks, taking over when his predecessor was abruptly fired after telling Congress he did not believe that FEMA should be eliminated, as President Donald Trump has contemplated. Richardson has no disaster-management experience, and has reportedly expressed surprise at how broad FEMA’s remit is.\n\nIn mid-May, CNN obtained an internal document warning that FEMA was badly behind schedule for hurricane season. Richardson suggested that FEMA would return to its 2024 hurricane-preparedness strategy, though “how that will work is anyone’s guess,” Graham writes, “given that FEMA has already slashed programs and staff since last year’s hurricane season.”\n\nFEMA is also making recovery harder for the victims of past disasters, declining funding or support for Washington State, North Carolina, and elsewhere after major disasters. The government refused individual federal assistance to nine Arkansas counties struck by tornadoes in March, reversing the decision only after Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who served as press secretary in Donald Trump’s first administration, called the president directly.\n\n“Yet if FEMA isn’t prepared for hurricane season, doesn’t have sufficient staff, and is laboring under a president who would like to see it gone, the problem may not be that only the president’s allies can get help from the federal government—but rather that no one can,” Graham continues.\n\nRead more: [https://theatln.tc/Kqnyce3G](https://theatln.tc/Kqnyce3G)",

        "body": "When Elon Musk declared Tuesday that President Donald Trump’s signature legislation was a “disgusting abomination,” it caught the West Wing by surprise and sent Republican leaders in Congress scrambling, unsuccessfully, to get Musk on the phone.\n\nA day later, both GOP leaders and White House officials are [downplaying the actual impact of the tech billionaire’s outburst](https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/04/politics/elon-musk-trump-agenda-bill?utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit), even as some vent frustration with Musk behind the scenes. White House officials, while annoyed by the matter, said they ultimately did not believe the comments would impact how senators vote on Trump’s prized bill. Two administration officials even went as far as suggesting Musk’s opposition could actually help Trump’s measure, given how toxic the Tesla CEO has become over the course of his time in Trump’s orbit.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune both evinced no worry whatsoever that it would change Republicans’ minds or sink the massive border, tax and spending cuts package. While several GOP senators had been expressing doubts about the bill for weeks, none cited new concerns over Musk’s comments. Republican leaders remain bullish that they can deliver the legislation to Trump’s desk by July 4 – an ambitious timeline.\n\nWhatever happens, one thing did seem clear: While Trump and Musk’s alliance is not broken, the two are slowly growing apart as their interests diverge and their relationship becomes more distant. People close to the president view the situation as something of an inevitability: they braced for potential conflicts once Musk no longer enjoyed close proximity with Trump – and the outsized power that goes along with it.\n\nThe one-time government employee’s recent claims that he would be less involved in politics, coupled with his departure from the White House last week, almost instantly shifted some of the influence he had held for the past several months.",

Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”\n\n“It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt,” he added in a subsequent post.\n\nMusk’s beef does not appear to be with the massive cuts the Trump-endorsed reconciliation package makes to social services like Medicaid in order to pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, but the trillions it is expected to add to the national deficit. His ire could also be tied to the fact that the bill will likely cut tax credits for Americans who purchase electric vehicles, which were a boon to EV manufacturers like Tesla.\n\nRead more: [https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-trump-tax-bill-disgusting-abomination-1235354326/](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/elon-musk-trump-tax-bill-disgusting-abomination-1235354326/)",

On top of how the climate is obviously changing, man made contributions or not, it's still getting hotter & hotter, every single year, & we all know it. We need more resources put together for what is coming, not less.\n\nTo the future generations of humanity, I'm sorry, but there was shit all most of us could do.

It is going to turn,’” he said, referring to the NWS’s hurricane prediction ability. “And I am here to tell you that I am not sure I can do that this year, because of the cuts, the gutting, the sledgehammer attack on science in general.… This is a multigenerational impact on science in this country.”\n\n>Morales first noted that all central and south Florida NWS sites are around 20 to 40 percent understaffed right now. There has been “nearly 20 percent reduction in weather balloon releases, launches, that carry those radio signs. And what we’re starting to see is that the quality of the forecast is becoming degraded because of some of these cuts,” he added. \n\n>“There is also a chance that … NOAA Hurricane Hunter aircraft will not be able to fly this year. And with less reconnaissance missions, we may be flying blind. And we may not exactly know how strong a hurricane is before it reaches the coastline.” \n\nhttps://bsky.app/profile/johnmoralestv.bsky.social/post/3lqo2siaanc2b",

His Presidential legacy will stand out and alone amongst all the former Presidents of the United States for what he has done through his decisions. The future will look back on this moment in time and know, only donald trump, as President of the United States could accomplish all that he has done in so short a time that has had a lasting affect on America and the World. Honestly, I am speechless as I write this essay about donald trump, and a moment I'll remember, always, until my dying day.",

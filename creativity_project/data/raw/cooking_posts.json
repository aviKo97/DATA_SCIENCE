      "content": "Look, I get it. There are \"proper\" ways to do things in the kitchen. Traditional methods, classic techniques, whatever. But honestly? I'm getting tired of seeing people get jumped on for doing things differently.\n\nHere's the thing though \\~ if they're eating it and enjoying it, who cares? Not everyone has the time, energy, or interest to follow every single rule. Some people just want to eat something tasty without turning it into a whole production.\n\nI've been cooking for years and yeah, I know the \"right\" ways to do most things. But you know what? Sometimes I still make pasta and just dump jar sauce on it because I'm tired and it tastes fine to me. Sometimes I'll throw random stuff together that would make a chef cry, but it works for what I need.\n\nFood is supposed to bring people joy. When we constantly nitpick how others cook, we're just making people feel bad about something that should be fun and satisfying. Not everyone needs to be a culinary expert.\n\nObviously if someone's asking for advice or trying to improve, that's different. But when someone's just sharing what they made and they seem happy with it? Maybe we could just let them enjoy their food without the lecture.\n\nWhat do you think? Am I crazy for thinking we should just let people cook how they want?",

When I started waiting until the onion was cooked before adding the garlic, viola, no more burnt garlic.\n\nWhat lies have your recipes told you?",

Fresh coconut also works of course)\n\nDark rum (Mount Gay Eclipse is my preferred).\n\nEdit: also add optional coconut milk or coconut cream, especially if you don't have Harmless Harvest or fresh coconut, because other varieties of coconut water are not as flavorful, so you have to make up for it. I recommend Aroy-D brand coconut milk or coconut cream.",

      "content": "So I've been cooking for about 8 years now, started when I moved out for college and was tired of ramen every night. Recently learned something that honestly blew my mind and made me wonder what other simple tricks I've been missing.\n\nWas watching this old cooking show (think it was Julia Child or someone similar) and she mentioned salting pasta water until it \"tastes like the sea.\" Always thought that was just fancy talk, but decided to try it. Holy crap, the difference is incredible. The pasta actually has flavor instead of being this bland base that just soaks up sauce.\n\nThen I started thinking about all the other little things I picked up over the years that seemed small but totally changed how my food turned out:\n\nGetting a proper meat thermometer instead of guessing when chicken is done. No more dry, overcooked chicken or the fear of undercooking it.\n\nLetting meat rest after cooking. Used to cut into steaks immediately and wondered why all the juices ran out everywhere.\n\nActually preheating the pan before adding oil. Makes such a difference for getting a good sear.\n\nUsing kosher salt instead of table salt for most cooking. Way easier to control and doesn't make things taste weirdly salty.\n\nThe pasta water thing got me curious though. What other basic techniques am I probably screwing up without realizing it? Like, what's that one thing you learned that made you go \"oh, THAT'S why my food never tasted right\"?\n\nBonus points if it's something stupidly simple that most people overlook. Always looking to up my game in the kitchen.",

      "title": "Introducing you to the most delicious condiment you've (probably) never heard of: Skagenröra!",
      "content": "[Skagenröra](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skagenr%C3%B6ra) is a Swedish condiment in which shrimp, mayonnaise and dill are obligatory ingredients, but modern recipes may include crème fraîche or sourcream, finely chopped red onion, lemon, horseradish, dijon mustard and/or fish roe. The result is a heavenly rich conglomeration of saltiness, tanginess and umami from the sea, which makes for a perfect condiment. For some trivia, it is named after the (ironically) Danish coastal town of Skagen, as a tribute to the tastes from the Nordic seas.\n\nThe most common way to use it is on top of a slice of butter toasted white bread, and garnished with lemon, a sprig of dill and a small dollop of fish roe. This is called [toast skagen](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toast_Skagen) and is a very popular appetizer in Sweden.\n\nThe uses for skagenröra do not end there. It is popular as a topping for baked potato, but also for savory waffles. It goes really well with avocado, which is another food along with skagenröra that the Swedish chef [Tore Wretman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tore_Wretman) introduced to Sweden. I have seen recipes that use skagenröra as a savory crêpe filling and as a topping for rårakor, which is a traditional potato pancake.\n\nAnd although I have never tried it or heard about it, I can imagine that it would be the perfect topping for crispy hashbrowns/latkes, as a more American take on toast skagen. (I know latkes are Jewish but skagenröra isn't really kosher)\n\nAs a Swede myself, I feel like this condiment deserves some more recognition around the world, especially considering the bad reputation surströmming has given the Swedish cuisine. I know this subreddit is mainly made of an American audience just like the rest of Reddit, but I think that skagenröra would appeal to American taste buds, especially because it fits really well with foods popular in the US like baked potato, toast and waffles.\n\nAnd I know this post won't do much change. But even if just a handful of people tried it and loved it, that would be a win for every part of this post. Me, you, and skagenröra. Try it out, you will not regret it (if you are not worried about calories).\n\n[Here's a good recipe in English I found for toast skagen.](http://olivemagazine.com/recipes/fish-and-seafood/skagen-toast/)",

What are other items I can make and bring to him? He’s not a picky eater, and I also like trying new recipes. So far I’ve done oatmeal chocolate chip cookies, cinnamon rolls, and those god dam blueberry muffins the mentioned ten times in the post LOL. He travels a lot for work (his job requires extensive driving throughout the day if he’s not at his desk), so items that would be easy to eat on the go are a plus. Thank you! ",

The chicken cooks too fast\n\n2. The breading doesn’t really brown\n\nIt tastes more or less “ok” but it’s pale and the chicken gets to a higher temp than is preferred. The recipe calls to cook for 20-25 + 2-3 minutes with the broiler. I cooked mine for a little past 15 minutes (no broiler) and checked the temp and it was shooting up past 180 :( \n\nRe-reading the recipe, there are two things I didn’t do though: I didn’t bake them on a rack, just on a foil lined sheet instead. And I forgot to spray them with oil (although last time I *did* do that, and had the same issue of them not getting brown enough) \n\n\nAny tips here? Or a better recipe? \n\n\n",

So instead of getting a pot to make rice and putting the salmon filet out of the freezer and into the oven, I just opened a can of tuna. Smashed it in a bowl with a small avocado, added the soy sauce, spicy mayo and regular mayo and went to town. So quick, simple and delicious that I could cry from joy. Probably made it and ate it all in less than ten mins.\n\nAs dessert I had a spoonful of some really tasty jam made of some kind of small red berries. And I kept thinking that if i just had some cream cheese laying around, I would definitely have myself a “cheesecake” with just those two ingredients (though graham crackers to spread the cream cheese and jam on top of would definitely be a bonus).\n\nI truly love these ideas and would love to learn if you have any similar “recipes”.",

      "content": "When I was growing up in Tennessee in the 70's and 80's, my mother (and all my friends mothers) for a relatively routine breakfast would form into patties and cook a pound of breakfast sausage.  When the sausage was done, she would add flour to the 1/4 cup or so of fat left in the pan, and when the resulting roux was ready, a couple of cups of milk. Bam, gravy. And it was good! Or maybe so we thought at the time.\n\nNowadays, when I've tried to do the same, there isn't enough fat left in the pan to make the roux. So, you have to add some. And you then make the gravy. But it's flavorless. So you crumble a few of your patties and stir them in. And then you go to the internet for tips, and almost universally, southern sausage gravy recipes have you skip the patties entirely, breaking the sausage completely up as it cooks. And then add the flour to the sausage, etc.\n\nWas it a thing just associated with parents who grew up in the depression-era, and/or were very poor growing up? Were we poor? Was 70's and 80's sausage less lean and make more drippings? Have our tastes (and expectations) changed?",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nThere’s a traditional instant soup powder from my region in southeast Iran that I’ve always wanted to introduce to the world.\n\nIt’s called **Kashke Zard** – a sun-dried fermented powder made from doogh (a yogurt-based drink). Sistanis have made it for generations, and it’s one of those foods you just have to experience for yourself.\n\nJust add hot water and stir. It’s quick, natural, and based on traditional methods passed down through families in Sistan.\n\nWe usually have it in colder seasons, and it's packed with calcium and has a long shelf life without refrigeration.\n\nHave you ever seen something like this in your culture? I'd love to hear if anyone's familiar with dried or fermented dairy-based soups or drinks.",

I like to cook and explore new cuisines but as far as Asian food goes I’ve only tried to cook a few things on my own (yakisoba, pad thai, spring rolls, basic Asian inspired stir fry). The store is huge and has all sorts of stuff it’s kinda intimidating but it’s a great opportunity for me to expand my skillset. Where do I start?\n\nAny basic principles I should know or staple ingredients I should get? YouTubers that I should look into? Dishes I should try to make? \n\nA few notes: \n1. I prefer to eat Whole Foods plant based, meaning whole grains only (hence soba noodles) and no animal products (no fish sauce :/ ). I don’t restrict myself to this 100%, but it’s my preference for day to day meals. I do eat one meal per week that includes meat tho so I’m still open to suggestions that include meat/animal products \n\n2. A lot of the labels are in Chinese idk how redditors could help me with this online but like how do I find what I’m looking for\n\n3. I feel like noodles are essential. What are the best noodles to buy? (Instant or not or both I’m open to anything)",

I'd love to hear from people about dishes that actually mean something to your culture or family. Maybe something your grandma made, or a dish that's super common where you're from but hard to find elsewhere.\n\nBonus points if you can share any tips about where to find ingredients or techniques that make a real difference.

I put on some aged Pecorino Romano from this Italian deli downtown and used freshly cracked tellicherry peppercorns.  \nThe result was honestly better than the $28 plate I had at that fancy Italian place last month. I actually had a bit of extra spending money from a lucky night a couple weeks ago on jackpotcity so I figured why not treat myself. Now I don't think I'll ever order again (maybe if it's an emergency, but in normal days never again). To be honest, it's not even about the price like it feels so good when you actually put effort into something and it comes out so delicious and you feel proud because you were the one who made it.",

It has ground beef browned with onion on the bottom, a layer of corn and peas (my parents used canned, I use frozen) with mashed potatoes on top, then baked a bit to warm the veggies through and brown the top. No gravy, so it's not a true Shepards Pie. \n\nI have read about Quebecois Pate De Chinois, and it's pretty similar. My family is from New England, around New Bedford Mass, and originally from eastern Quebec (1700s). \n\nDoes anyone else call it \"birds nest\"? It has absolutely no bird products and other than using a round casserole dish doesn't even resemble a bird's nest. Maybe some sort of mistranslation? \n\nIts a regular staple at our house and I always wonder where that name came from. My dad says that's what they called it growing up. Unfortunately both my grandparents are long gone so I can't ask them.",

The kind lady is Thai and I asked her in the past for the recipe but she wouldn't give it to me so I guess it is a family secret so I stopped out of respect.  Now, I've tried thai sweet rice with coconut milk and mangos but that was not the rice plus the rice was in a riceball shape.\n\nThen, I discovered there is a thai sweet rice and tried as instructed online but the rice was not even sweet to me plus it tasted nothing like what the lady made.  I have looked online and tried some of the recipes but still nothing.  I'm desperate because even after all these years, I cannot get rid of the sweet riceballs she made.  I'm hoping someone may know of something similar or whatnot.  I do believe it has to be thai food because this lady is such an amazing chef and even dish she has made for me was top notch and always thai, which is what made me a fan of thai food.\n\nPlease help me, reader, I am hoping someone will know.  The riceball was just rice. Nothing but rice.  No seaweed, protein, vegetables,  etc. It was simply rice but sweet.  It wasn't overly sweet or leave anything weird on the tongue.  Plus the rice tasted like it was naturally sweet not like a type of syrup or sugar placed in the rice.  The riceball was completely white so no sauces to change the color of the grains.  I don't know how else to describe it.​",

I use uncle Ben’s short grain rice that comes in a bag because it’s my preferred rice for other dishes but is that what’s causing my Spanish rice to not turn out fluffy? Here’s the method I’ve been doing \n\nRinse rice until water is clear, let dry for 15 mins\n\nFry up onion in oil then add dried rice and toast until light brown in color. \n\nBlend tomatoes, chicken bullion, garlic, onion and some water in a blender add to rice. \n\nAdd one jalapeño and a small bunch of cilantro, cover rice as it comes to a boil and cook for 15-20 mins \n\nMy rice comes out kind of sticky or gummy and not fluffy. Any Spanish rice recipe I’ve tried causes my rice to not fluff correctly but I’ve only used the uncle Ben’s rice. I don’t have problems with that rice other wise, only when I try making Spanish rice. Is there a brand of rice you recommend to use for this?\n\nEdit: I did basmati rice and the liquid it called for and did not rinse the rice. I got the perfect consistency! Nice and fluffy. It did have a stronger flavor than I would want so maybe I should try jasmine next time? Also I checked my uncle Ben’s rice bag and it does say long grain but I’m not sure if it was the rice or the liquid either way my rice came out a success tonight! Thank you for the advice 🥰",

She cooked the chicken curry in a pan for a bit and it came out way better. So I guess I'm undercooking the chicken? Even though the meat thermometer literally said it was 170 degrees.\n\n  \nDoes anyone have suggestions?",

My recipe uses mayo, celery, onion, boiled egg, Yukon potatoes, salt, pepper, Dijon mustard, and it's never as good as I want it to be. My aunt makes a really good potato salad, but doesn't have any measurements and the ingredients seem to change! I taste it and I want it to be better but I don't know what to change. My point is, when your making something, how do you know what to do differently to make it better? Also, it would be great if anyone had advice on potato salad. Thanks!",

      "content": "This is probably a strangely worded request. But my favorite soup is split pea, usually split pea with ham. I've come across very good recipes online and they've always tasted delicious, but they don't quite capture the nostalgia I have for the split pea I'd get at delis & jewish delicatessens.\n\nI feel like those soups are often on the simpler side, either pureed to the point where it is uniformly pea or with some slight chunks of ham. They're usually thick and delicious and despite trying multiple recipes I can't quite get that flavor. I recently ordered from a place I'd never tried before that also did great pastrami sandwiches and yep, they nailed it. Was practically licking the bowl afterwards.\n\nWondering if there's a secret ingredient I haven't wizened up to. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",

      "content": "I've stumbled through various traditional potato salad recipes during my lifetime and wanted something different for a potluck.  This brought me to r/Cooking where I browsed a lot of ideas.  And from those ideas, today I made  the best potato salad of my life. Thank you !!!  Here is what I did:\n\nCook cubed potatoes from cold in 2 quarts water with 2 tb sugar, 2 tb salt, 2 tb vinegar added.  This technique from [https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-potato-salad-recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/classic-potato-salad-recipe) .  They have nice images showing how potatoes will take up seasoning while being cooked that they will not absorb after they are cold again.  I did not add the extra vinegar they recommend splashing on after cooking, instead I just drained and chilled the potato chunks overnight.  I did not follow the rest of their recipe, I only used the cooking technique.  I had organic potatoes so I left some skins on where they were nice and cut off skin where it was ugly.  I didn't measure how much potatoes I had, it was maybe 12 smallish russet potatoes.  The two quarts water easily covered them when cubed.  I watched the potatoes closely to make sure they didn't overcook.  I was afraid I had slightly overcooked them, but after mixing it all up, they're perfect.  Better a little over than under, was my thought.\n\nSautée one chopped onion in olive oil until translucent, then add 1 tb chopped garlic, and sauté a little longer, then add mixture to top of chilled potatoes.  (I had pre-chopped garlic in a jar from Costco.  I feel like it's milder than fresh garlic would be? I'd prefer fresh, of course, but didn't have any.)\n\n2 ears boiled sweet corn, cut off the cob and sautéed in a little olive oil to warm up and break up the kernels, cobs scraped with a knife to get all the corn juices, add to bowl on top of potatoes and onions\n\n1/2 pound roughly chopped bacon, so you end up with big cooked pieces about the size of a quarter, drain and dump on paper towel to absorb excess bacon fat, add to bowl.\n\nMix potato, onion, corn, bacon\n\nMix dressing in a separate bowl: 1 cup mayo, 1 cup sour cream, squirt mustard (I had yellow), 1 tb sugar, 1-1/2 tsp salt, 1 tb cider vinegar, zest of one lemon, mix, add to potatoes, and mix all.  Enjoy !\n\nIn the future I'd like to try some fresh herbs in it,  (dill? parsley?)  but I didn't have any today.  Other ideas I read, but didn't have available today, would be celery and apple.",

      "content": "Just sharing the results of my hunt for an egg ring for my dad's birthday.\n\nHe loves McDonald's breakfasts and I wanted to give him a present so he could make them for himself to save money (and calories). My requirements:\n\n* Dishwasher-safe\n* Able to be used countless times for years\n* Comes as a small set of 1-3, one guy doesn't need 12 egg rings\n* Is 3.5–4\" in diameter\n* Is *good* - won't leak egg underneath\n\nAfter watching a YouTube video [on how McDonald's makes their breakfast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH88Bbq9isU), I realized they use silicone.\n\n**Silicone**\n\nThe most common one on Amazon you'll see are indeed made from silicone but have tiny little handles on them to more easily pick them up, like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-ASER-Cookie-Cutters-Yellow/dp/B0084MN7RE) from Lodge, or [this](https://www.amazon.com/Grade-Silicone-Multicolor-Cooking-Inches/dp/B08T6BJW2N) cheaper knock off. Lots of video reviews of these on YouTube. These looked *horrible*! So many nooks and crannies for egg to get into, and the hinge looked like it would either melt in the dishwasher, or fall apart after a lot of use. Silicone also means these can't be used for baking, so that limits their use for my dad.\n\n[A more fancy version](https://www.amazon.com/Blackstone-5600-Silicone-Breakfast-Cooking/dp/B09R53PL6C) of this by Blackstone resembles McDonald's more closely but came as a pack of 3, and each made 2 eggs, which was too much for one guy.\n\nNext!\n\n**Non-stick**\n\nThe number one result on Amazon for \"egg ring\" are things [like this](https://www.amazon.com/COTEY-Nonstick-Crumpet-English-Muffins/dp/B085ZTGGTJ), a non-stick coated ring, with a handle attached.\n\nI immediately noped out of this, that non-stick coating would fall apart in the dishwasher and go into the food. There are reviews on all of these on Amazon to that effect. I am definitely not trying to give my dad cancer, lol.\n\nNext!\n\n**Stainless steel**\n\nOk, here's where it got tricky. There are lot of simple stainless steel options on Amazon, but the simplicity of this makes it susceptible to junk products.\n\nFor instance, a lot of the rings are spot welded, [like this one](https://www.amazon.com/Norpro-3776-Stainless-English-Muffin/dp/B07BB54V8S), which will cause them to fall apart pretty quickly. \n\nEventually, I realized I was looking in the wrong section of Amazon. Instead of searching \"egg ring,\" I wound up looking under pastry rings: https://www.amazon.com/s?rh=n%3A17409597011\n\nAfter a long night of hunting, I finally found one that looked really good but was a little risky: [\"Heavy Gauge Stainless Steel Round Ring Mold\"](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XGPY8MG). The product image of this is terrible, and it was pretty expensive, but the reviews and uploaded photos convinced me.\n\nWe made our first breakfast with it this morning! The rings don't leak, the seam is almost unnoticeable, and they washed well in the dishwasher. He was pretty excited to use these again. Mission accomplished!\n\nHope this helps someone else!",

I decided to make it a little different than usual and do pineapple fried rice. So I cut up a pineapple and cooked it with the veggies to add to the rice. \nAfter finishing cooking, I went to have some for my lunch only to find out it was INCREDIBLY spicy and pretty much inedible.

Things like canned vegetables, frozen vegetables, boxed kits, that sort of thing.  While making Great Value thick and creamy mac and cheese, I found using real cooking methods greatly improved the outcome.  I stopped melting the butter and then adding it to the sauce mix, which resulted in a greasier sauce, and instead toss the butter in a pat at a time over barely any heat to keep the butter’s emulsion intact like you would for a classic burre blanc.  Seems like such a small thing, but the improvement is noticeable.  So, the question, does anyone else do similar things to “cheat” convenience foods so they taste better or have better texture, etc?

      "content": "Recipe  \nIngredients: -Three cups of basil leaves (Italian Genovese, Everleaf Emerald Towers, or any other vibrant green basil cultivar will work)\n\n\\-All purpose flour (at least three cups)\n\n\\-Egg yolks (seven)\n\n\\-Olive oil (about a tablespoon)\n\n\\-Butter (four tablespoons)\n\n\\-Pesto (about two tablespoons)\n\n\\-Salt (to taste)\n\n\\-Fresh cracked black pepper (one and a half tablespoons)\n\nMethod:\n\n1) Blanch the basil in boiling water for 15-25 seconds, then immediately douse in an ice bath to stop the cooking. \n\n2) Blend the basil with some water and ice cubes from the ice bath to create a puree.\n\n3) Whisk the egg yolks separately to achieve homogeneity before combining with the basil puree. \n\n4) Combine egg yolks and basil puree.\n\n5) Create a well of flour on a counter.\n\n6) Pour in the basil puree and yolk mixture.\n\n7) Stir the egg yolk basil mixture within the flour well, and with each stir incorporate a bit of the flour from the side walls into the liquid, until it slightly comes together into a semi-cohesive dough.\n\n8) At this point, switch to a bench scraper and continue to mix/combine the dough.\n\n9) Once the dough has reached a kneadable state, begin kneading for ten to fifteen minutes. \n\n10) Wrap the dough and let rest for one hour.\n\n11) Once dough has rested, divide into halves or quarters, and roll out into sheets.\n\n12) Use a fettucine cutter to cut the sheets into fettucine.\n\n13) Cook pasta, typically only thirty seconds or so, until al dente.\n\n14) Drain pasta, reserving at least a cup of the pasta cooking liquid for the sauce.\n\n15) In the pot the pasta was cooked in, melt the butter.\n\n16) Once the butter is melted, add in the pesto, and cook for about a minute.\n\n17) Add in the pasta water, and reduce until the sauce is thick and has reached a nappant consistency. \n\n18) Once reduced to perfection, add back in the pasta and toss well to combine the sauce with the pasta. \n\n19) Plate with fresh cracked black pepper, flakey Malden salt, and basil cut in a chiffonade style. \n\nHere is a link to an image of the final plating, not sure why this subreddit doesn't allow images, seems like in order to best show off a dish, you kind of need to be able to see it.   \n[https://www.reddit.com/user/pavelvito/comments/1l072ev/basil\\_infused\\_fettucine/](https://www.reddit.com/user/pavelvito/comments/1l072ev/basil_infused_fettucine/)",

That being said, what are some other recipes you like to use radishes in, either featuring radish or using it as a topping like for these tacos that I can use the rest of these things on?",

      "content": "I am a 20-year-old who has lived primarily on turkey sandwiches and fast food for most of my life. I have always dreaded doing the dishes and spending time cooking, but as I got older, I realized that I could barely cook a decent scrambled egg. So, I challenged myself to learn a new dish and technique every single day.\n\nYesterday, I made the creamiest and most flavorful scrambled eggs I have ever tasted—it was life-changing after watching a few tutorial videos. Today, I decided to make a steak sandwich on a ciabatta roll. I watched several videos on how to caramelize onions (which take a while, but are absolutely worth it), and I created the most delicious steak sandwich, topped with sweet caramelized onions and paired with a flavorful mayonnaise and horseradish sauce. I can confidently say: I will never go back to fast food.\n\nI’ve never experienced so much dopamine before that first bite. To say I’m happy is an understatement. Cooking over the past couple of days has brought me a joy I never knew I could feel.\n\nI’d love to hear new dishes I could challenge myself to make. I’m open to all kinds of dishes, especially those involving potatoes and protein—please share your favorites! Wishing everyone a great morning, and I hope to hear about some amazing recipes !!",

I don't own a smoker for one, so I'm thinking roasting the pork could make a close enough substitute, but how long should I boil it in the soup in order for the flavor of the pork to infuse with the rest of the soup? Do I just add it at the end because it's already cooked, like topping? But the soup tasted smoky as well.\n\nOf course, I know that I would never  be able to replicate the recipe one to one (nor am I tying to), but I'd like to be able to make something close to enjoy at home.",

      "content": "I’ve been making chicken noodle soup off of a modified version of the one found in the American Test Kitchen cookbook. I usually get a whole chicken (instead of just chicken thighs) and cut it up myself and then follow their instructions, making sure to include all the bones and cartilage. Normally, this results in a chicken soup that, once cooled in the fridge, is jelly-like, and it’s delicious when warmed back up again. However, the last two times I’ve made the recipe, I haven’t achieved my desired gelatinous texture, just a standard watery soup.\n\nI usually brown all parts of the chicken on all sides in a dutch oven (uncovered), and then add my mirepoix and cover it on low heat for 20 minutes, then add just enough water to cover it all in my 6 qt dutch oven and bring it to a boil before covering it again and letting it simmer for another 20-30 minutes. I think I generally follow this pretty closely.\n\nI wasn’t feeling well for my last two attempts so my roommate took care of browning the chicken and then I took over afterwards, and I think I also added more diced tomatoes for flavor lately. I’ve been reading “Salt Fat Acid Heat” so I’m wondering if the acidic tomatoes are screwing with the gelatin/collagen formation, or if it’s likely that I haven’t been getting the liquid to the proper temp afterwards. Does bringing the soup to boiling ruin it? Or is it possible that I haven’t been bringing it to a high enough temperature for the past two attempts and this prevents collagen formation? Too much water? I’ve got two dutch ovens of different size that look very familiar but also I imagine a whole chicken carcass has an awful lot of gelatin so I don’t know what the ratio is there.\n\nAny other tips to get my soup back to its jelly like state again?",

A strong steam function for reheating is especially important to us.\n\nI’ve already gone through two Samsung models and unfortunately faced repeated issues with steam pooling rather than venting properly, so I'm now considering switching brands.\n\nThe models I’m currently looking at are:\n\n🔹 Bosch CSG7584B1 – Compact steam combi oven with PerfectBake, PerfectRoast & Air Fry\n🔹 Bosch CSG7364B1 – Steam oven with grill, slow cook and standard steam functions\n🔹 Siemens CS736G1B1 iQ700 – fullSteam oven with soft-close, cookControl Pro & humidClean\n🔹 Miele DGC 7440 or DGC 7845 – Steam combination ovens with Miele's DualSteam tech and food probe options\n\nIf anyone has experience with any of these – or can recommend a reliable steam oven that’s great for everyday family use, I’d really appreciate it!\n\nThanks in advance 😊",

I feel like I can recreate most of it but would not know where to get smoked hake. Anyone know a good substitute? Maybe (hot smoked) trout?  ",

      "content": "I like making veggie/vegan stocks for use in risottos etc, and have been loosely following/combining the two recipes linked below. The TLDR is - take a load of veggies, very thinly slice then slowly roast them until thoroughly browned, then simmer them with kombu, dried mushrooms, a little tomato paste, and parsley, and add a little white miso, maybe a touch of soy - to amp up the umami. I then reduce/concentrate this a little depending on how concentrated it is. Veggies include eggplant, onions, garlic, carrot, celery, cauliflower, broccoli, fresh mushrooms.\n\nMy question essentially is - does anybody have any idea or tricks for elevating this? Any secret ingredients that will make it pop? It's already pretty delicious but, like most things, I'm sure there are techniques, ingredients, or tricks I'm missing to turn it up to 11. Any ideas/thoughts greatly appreciated. \n\n  \nTIA\n\n\\-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgYRtHwJ28\n\n\\-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9wLEKKEcok&t=1s",

I'm having some guests tmr so I decided to make a bunch of pizza dough (for pizza, garlic knots, and for myself once they leave lol). I had this idea in my head that sounds good but idk how to execute it, just to wow them. Basically, I wanna either bake or fry small balls of dough (like you would with cinnamon bread) and coat them in honey (have a decent amount in my cupboard and go through it slowly). I find cinnamon bread to be too sweet for me. I also have some cardamom in my cupboard bc my mom told me to get it lol but I'm not sure how I'd use it in such a desert. Other ingredients I have that may be of interest:\n\n* Really good olive oil (People sleep on small, independent Arab grocery stores. Don't buy olive oil from anywhere else)\n\n* Canola oil\n\n* Basil \n\n* Dill\n\n* Garlic \n\n* Various cheeses (pepper jack, colby, mozz)\n\n* (Rooh afza)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooh_Afza]\n\n* Ofc the usual stuff like salt and sugar\n\nHow did this come about? I wanna make them desert but I'm broke as shit and I wanna use what I already got lol. Plus, one time at my college, one of the ethnic student associations (Albanian? Persian? Idk, I wish I remembered) was giving out small bread bites coated in honey and they were so good. I'm not sure what specifically I'm asking for, other than how would you use the ingredients mentioned to make the best tasting thing?\n\nWould've posted in either r/pizza or r/baking but they both require photos.

Not necessarily comprehensively, but an overview, anyway.\n\nTo give an example, it would say that this meat-filled bread roll could be a kolache, a bierock, or a pirozhki, or if fried could be called other things, and would say where those dishes are from.  Maybe compare their similarities and differences. I don't care if there are recipes, those are obviously easy to source if you know what the dishes are called.\n\nThere are so very many dishes people all around the world cook, but season differently or change an ingredient or two, and I'd love to have a single reference for this.",

I’m trying to eat clean but I love fried chicken and I want to try to make a substitute.\n\nMy first attempt I used an air fryer and almond flour (along with my own seasoning) it was INCREDIBLY flavorful but unfortunately not very crispy and kind of soggy. I know almond flour doesn’t crisp as well as bread crumbs, but I’m wondering how much of the sogginess was because I used almond flour and how much of it was because I didn’t pat the chicken with a paper towel and didn’t leave any space between the strips\n\nI also tried again with Panko crumbs and an oven, this time I left way more space and it crisped well but it was kind of dry which I can fix pretty easily (smaller cooking time and bigger strips). Though it also didn’t have the same flavor as the almond flour ones. \n\nI could use my panko crumb recipe for my macro friendly chicken strips, but I really want to try to make the almond flower work (Plus I want to make them Halal, because I’m moving to London for college and I want to be able to make these for friends regardless of religious restrictions). Can the almond flour crisp or should I just stick with the panko?\n\n",

I'm glad I did as it added that special character to the oil flavor. I also added dried anchovies and the shredded dried pork in with the shrimp and scallops. I had a hunch that cooking diced ham or prosciutto would be too much hard texture and I was right.\n\nThe prep was a bit obnoxious but once the fryig started it went fast and smelled amazing. \n\nI jarred up the extras as the recipe rentered more than enough.\n\n10/10 would do again! The flavor is amazing. The texture is crazy and the spice is perfect (for me)",

It worked, they were amazing, everyone loved them. \n\nWhat I did: the Kenji method - boil in vinegar-water 10mins, dry, fry for 50seconds, cool 30 mins, fry for 5-6 mins. \nThen I wanted to keep them warm because my burgers weren’t ready. The fries got completely limp in the meantime. Fried them for 1min again in batches in the end and they were crisp again. \n\nThe procedure works, it’s just tedious heating up the oil over and over and just working with super hot oil so much in general. So my question: is there a way to decrease the time and numbuer of fryings?\n\nOur idea was: boil, fry for 50s, bake in the oven for like 15-30 mins (would have to try how long exactly) and then get them crispy again with another 1min fry.\na) Do you think that would work? Why would(n‘t) it work?\nb) do you think there is even a benefit of doing this?\nc) could I maybe omit the first short-fry as well this way and only fry 1-2 mins in the end, or would the fries nit get crisp, then?",

The recipe calls for toasting the spices before making the harissa. However - it seems to me that the right time for the spices to be heated would be just before you're going to eat them?\n\nGiven that I'll be cooking the sausages - won't the spices 'release their flavour' - at the point I cook them - and then be most flavourful at the point I eat them?\n\nDoes this make sense?",

I can't recall a single appearance of canned tuna in the cupboards or the kitchen table during my entire childhood.\n\nThis fact never really occurred to me until recently, when there was a big sale on canned tuna at my market and I picked up three cans on a whim. I'm kind of excited to try something that's a pantry staple, and yet completely out of my range of experience. Due to my tuna-free childhood, I've no idea how to use it.\n\nI know about tuna salad, but solely through my exposure to mass-media.\n\nWhat can I do with this stuff? What are the rules for canned tuna? Can I use it in casual dishes where my experience says \"and if you want to add some protein, sure, add it in right here\"? Recipes, techniques, even basics that you think everybody knows. Anything would be useful.",

Sure I know a few tidbits here and there but I can’t actually put anything together on my own. \n\nRecently I discovered Kenji Lopez.

Baking soda on a flap steak? So freaking good! You’d think after years of cooking I’d know how to cut a steak, nope, but thanks to this book I do now! \n\nI really like that he uses recipes and explains the thought process behind it at the same time. I have ADHD so it’s a bit difficult to get through books that all only have thought process and are heavily technical. But if I can actually make something while learning, it’s a godsend. \n\nWhat are some learning materials that are similar? Thank you! ",

      "content": "Call me crazy, but I'm making burgers for dinner tonight, and I have a bottle of oyster sauce I use for cooking asian dishes. But I was wondering if anyone has tried adding it to their ground beef mix for a hamburger to enhance that umami flavor.  \n\nI've found a few recipes on Google, so it's definitely not unheard of, even [Lee Kum Kee](https://usa.lkk.com/en/recipes/hamburgers-with-oyster-flavored-sauce) has a recipe where you brush it on the patties before cooking. \n\nFor anyone who has tried it before, does it significantly change the flavor/texture of the burger, and how did you apply it? Mixed in the meat, brushed on before/after cooking? Any additional spices/seasonings that would accentuate it while maintaining a \"normal\" flavor to the finished burger. I'm not looking for something that has a distinct asian flavor, just trying to enhance the flavors that are already there.",

I had an idea for steak and shrimp with potatoes and asparagus for the main course but I feel like that’s overdone. I think i’m just over thinking it a little bit because i wanted it to be good. Any ideas would be helpful!\ni forgot to add that my partner doesn’t like seafood other than shrimps and he really loves meat.",

Actually, I think I can eat chimichurri with anything. It is so divine and tangy from garlic and sauce. \nWhat about homegrown lettuce? \nDuring the spring and summer, even if you do not have a big garden, get a couple of troughs and sow lettuce seeds. Every 3 or 4 days, you will have plenty of green salad leaves for a couple of people. The taste cannot be comparable to the supermarket bought leaves. They are tender and more flavourful! Yum- yum-\n",

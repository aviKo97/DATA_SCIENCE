What I really believe you mean is \"complex\" rather than \"heavy\". Listen to some Renaissance music. That stuff is \"heavy.\" Haydn and Mozart. Simple. Beethoven is heavy. Robert Glass is simple. My theory is musicians/composers are constantly trying to push the boundaries and once they get to a point where they reach the limits the only thing left is to go back to simplicity and it's ground breaking when they do because it's seen through a new lens.",

It will become much cheaper to kill people.\n\nThe first thing that is problematic is terrorist groups becoming more efficient as a function of lives lost. The ratio of terrorist to army deaths is very high. Many dozens to possibly thousands depending on the conflict.\n\nI expect that to come down in the coming decades.\n\nThe second thing is traceability. If someone could fly a tiny drone into a stadium or a school and have it explode to remove all evidence while also killing and maiming, and for about $100-$1000, and it can't be traced back to them, then that has the potential to make things very unpleasant.",

So, I guess this is kind of like a atheistic form of reincarnation: when we die and disintegrate into nothingness, given an infinite universe (or series of universes), would we eventually \"come back\" as something. I've had this thought a couple of times, but then had an interesting follow-up thought. Given when we die our consciousness would immediately cease - an infinite amount of time may pass, but we would have no perception of the passing of time, so we would \"wake up\" immediately after dying essentially with amnesia, as quite likely as another creature. I guess then the question boils down to 'what' exactly is consciousness and is it as simple as shifting about atoms.. no idea, but had a good time shuffling about this thought.",

If something doesn't work they don't do it again.\n\nThis first time it worked, they both liked it. Adults wouldn't approve, so they would go off by themselves to play around. The kid would soon outgrow these early small horses. But it would be remembered and repeated by future children, like small kids ride sheep or goats occasionally now.\n\nThe first horses used as adult transport were in north Africa during the last glacier period, when the Sahara was green. Young men built light all-wood chariots, hitched to 2 small native horses. With their weight on the chariot's axle, two horses could run, towing the young man behind.\n\nThousands of years later, Central Europe/Asia horses were big enough to carry smaller lighter people, often women for their weight advantage. With an obvious advantage in stronger horses, selective breeding took over.\n\nChariots were preferred for thousands of years until horses slowly became strong enough to carry full-size adult males.",

        "body": "This is much more than a shower thought! You've just basically discovered the core concept of all western legal theory! The thing is that you're entirely correct, but wait, there's more!\n\nFor this post I am going to be referring to the US constitution, but what I'm about to say is generally true for any western style legal system in the world. Have you ever heard of habeas corpus? It's one of those fun Latin phrases that people throw around at parties, or that you hear on the news. It's typically a pretty boring thing these days but that hasn't always been the case. Habeas corpus is a \"right\" (air-quotes because we haven't formally defined the term, and we do not have the space to here) that means you cannot be detained without cause. It's actually the only right mentioned in the US constitution (Art 1, Sec 9, Clause 2), and it took a full two years for the Bill of Rights to be ratified which then enumerated the other \"rights\" that you've come to know, love, and confuse.\n\nThe reason that it is the only right to be included in the constitution is because habeas corpus was/is widely seen as the, \"right from which all other rights flow.\" In fact, it was debated by the founding fathers whether to even have a Bill of Rights and enumerate the other rights (e.g. speech,) because some founders thought that by virtue of even having a list and writing them down they would be weakening the concept of rights; i.e., it was their belief that you were free to do anything and that by having a list it would constrain freedom.\n\nThat's all bullshit though, right? I mean who wants to read the Federalist & Anti-Federalist papers anyway? \n\nThe thing is that, and this is a fact, if you deny someone habeas corpus (i.e. if you can physically detain them without cause) you have therefore also denied them of all of their subsequent rights, and we can say this is true without even needing to list what other rights there are. Free speech? Not if you're stuck in a prison cell and being held against your will without charges. Right to own a gun? Ha! Good luck getting one past the guards.\n\nThis is kind of making sense so far, right? The government needs a reason to arrest and imprison you. They need to prove that you committed a crime. Meaning that they need to pass legislation outlining that a certain activity is criminal, and then they need to demonstrate that you engaged in that activity. Like, duh, they can't arrest you for having an opinion, right? No? Why not? Well yeah, duh, the first amendment, but a simpler argument is that they cannot arrest you for having an opinion because it isn't against the law to have an opinion, and this is the important part: **it is not legal for the government to make a law that you cannot have an opinion.**\n\nAny law that the government makes that attempts to criminalize having an opinion, per the constitution, would be an overstep of power. You see the constitution isn't really a document that applies to individuals at all, it's a document that outlines the power that the government has, and it outlines which branches of government have which powers. Remember our good old friend habeas corpus and how it is the **only** right mentioned in the constitution? Yeah, well it's mentioned in the context that the government has the right to suspend it during times of crisis.\n\nRead that again. \n\nThe only right in the constitution that is mentioned, the right that all other rights come from, is only mentioned in the context that the government has the right to suspend it. This isn't a fairy tale, that is literally what the constitution says, and Lincoln actually did this during the Civil War.\n\nOK, but we're really far from your shower thought, and we're really far from any of this making sense, right?\n\nNot so fast! You see habeas corpus is based on an even older concept known as *nulla poena sine lege*, which is a mouthful and guaranteed to impress a lawyer at a party. Nulla poena sine lege is the concept that there cannot be a punishment without a law. At the surface this seems very similar to habeas corpus, but it's a much deeper concept.\n\nWhy can't the government imprison you for putting pineapple on a pizza?\n\nThe simple answer is that the government cannot make a law that you can't put pineapple on a pizza because it lacks the power to do so (the government can only do what the constitution allows them to do,) and since there can be no law that it is illegal to put pineapple on a pizza the government therefore cannot detain you for doing so because of habeas corpus.\n\nSo back now to your shower thought. Everything is legal except for certain things which the government has said is illegal. Nice and simple right?\n\nExcept yeah, no, it isn't simple at all. Nothing is spelled out because there is nothing to spell out. If you want to do something and it isn't **specifically against the law** then you can do it. The government might make a law that it is illegal in the future, but you cannot be punished for doing it before the law is created.\n\nThat's why you have to consult with an attorney, and even then it doesn't mean you're going to get the correct answer. Often/most times an attorney is only going to give you their own personal opinion, and often questions about what is or isn't legal will be reviewed by a group of attorneys. Very often the opinion you'll get from a group of attorneys is, \"we don't know.\"\n\nThey aren't being difficult, they literally don't know, because there might not be any legal basis (case law) on the matter for them to even form an educated opinion, and in fact they may charge you hundreds of thousands of dollars, and do hundreds of hours of research simply to tell you that they don't know depending on how complex the question is.\n\nIt is much easier to list the things you can't do, because there's actually a list (it's the US criminal code,) than it is to list all the things you can do... because you can do anything you want that isn't on the other list. That's literally by design.",

Can't imagine that being particularly good for you, subzero water freezing solid halfway down your throat.\n\nIf anyone actually knows the physics for this and if this could be a thing, please do let me know cause I could very well be talking straight out of my ass here..\n\nAlso come to think of it saltwater can be colder than 0° without freezing. Could that become cold enough to harm you while remaining drinkable? What about some other solution, there's gotta be some foodsafe soluble that significantly lowers the freezing temperature...",

Most of these (eg dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, GABA etc are alkaloids. Alkaloids are molecules that have a nitrogen in them, which tends to make them polar (dissolve in water, not in fats). So MDMA, adderall, psilocybin, LSD, mescaline, almost all of the big ones, they don’t dissolve well into your skin, which is fatty. Instead they dissolve well in your gut, or in your nose, or in your blood or your bootyhole. That’s why those are the most common ways to take it. THC, which mimics endogenous cannabinoid neurotransmitters, is the one common exception because cannabinoids are one of the few fatty ones.\n\nThe other reason is that drugs feel better when they hit faster. And absorbing through the skin is the slowest ROA. You can buy fentanyl patches (which absorb because of a special solvent called DMSO that carries it through the skin into the blood) but it’s not very fun to get high on, making it an excellent way to help people manage pain with low risk of abuse.",

Skin absorption depends on whether the drug is fat soluble or water soluble as well as a few other characteristics. \n\nHow much a drug gets you high depends in part on how quickly it enters the bloodstream. Generally speaking skin absorption is one of the slowest ways, injecting is the fastest way. The faster something gets absorbed the more you feel it. That's why a nicotine patch doesn't give you the same buzz as smoking a cigarette. \n\nMost people who take recreational drugs want to feel it. \n\nThere is actually a medically prescribed opioid patch which is given to control pain in terminally ill patients. There, the goal is not to get high but to deliver slow acting, long acting, pain relief. It works very well for that purpose and population, but you can't get high on it.",

(correct in this sense equals what it showed yesterday+1)\n\nAfter a week a lot of the worlds problems would disappear, food and energy shortage a thing of the past, we literally can not eat and use everything in a day. The only valuable jobs people would do is open the doors to stores (free for all, no need to collect money that'll be gone the next day, and there's no reason for people to hoard things anyways) and the people in big tech companies that'll fix the calender apps every day.  Someone would probably man bowling alleys and amusement parks, just take turns of it (everyone can do it, if you mess up it resets tomorrow. same with restaurants and  bars, but these places would probably be largely abandoned because you couldn't collect any profits from them, just favours.\n\nWould suck a lot for people in hospitals in severe pain, and a little for people in places with shit weather every day.",

This is due to the fact that every day is different, meaning you might brush your teeth a different way or (for lack of a better term) get up on a different side of the bed. So, many people would soon recognize if it’s the same day because of the way that we do things slightly different each day. Even though we do these small things differently each day and we don’t really realize, our brain does and so we would be alerted to the fact that it’s the same day. Obviously, if someone had a flight one day and woke up the next day to realize they have the same flight, instantly they would realize it’s the same day. Another example would be if you are a college student, you don’t have the same classes every single day. Also, classes are at different times on different days. You would wake up and realize you have the same classes and therefore you would recognize that it’s the same day due to the fact that had the same classes and schedule the day before.",

The \"fuckit\" works better.\n\nI'd say things like \"Use the push to make go up\" to describe opening the door for the dock.  I'm trying to move 35,000 packages between 4 warehouses.

I don't know.  It works when you're yelling it at someone who doesn't speak English.  Maybe palleta is a bucket.  I don't know.

It is very beautiful after it has been studied and presented you anyway that makes you aware of what the composer is getting at. \n\n    Certainly not harmonious music is anything that somebody has a child that is in office could possibly create on his own without study. And the ridiculous concept that people who take lessons are bound by rules and not free makes me insane. The idea that not absorbing the hundreds of years of musical genius which makes it so easy for you not to have to go through your own Discovery is absolutely liberating. I mean I can't believe that JS Bach, as being credited with establishing basic rules of harmonious writing would be desirably overlooked by a student only because the student feels as it rules bog you down it's almost laughable and I'm not being judgmental here but I have to studying the Masters I can tell you they've saved me a thousand years of studying on my own and I still wouldn't have come up with anything that would match the discovery of beautiful tonality that the great composers have put on a platter for us",

Twice.  \nAnyway, there are 217 of these radicals, from 1 stroke to 17 strokes and in the case of 𪚥 there is 48 strokes but then you got 𪚥 which is 84 strokes.  \nAnyway, i am digressing cause i find kanji extremly facinating, now every kanji is made from one or more radicals, so if you make the 217 radicals, you can re-use them in each, and most kanji that use a radical also use it in the same place so i showed you the radical for man earlier, and how it was used in immortal, welll here are 3 more kanji 休, 体, and 信 however if you use the kanji as a radical, it can be placed ontop, in the center and on the bottom, but the radical 亻will always be on the left.",

        "body": "I'm very familiar with the type design industry, so I'm happy to answer any questions about it.\n\nA large portion of the work can be automated, especially due to the repeated components across kanji. However, manual review is still essential - for design consistency (particularly if the font also includes Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Hebrew, or other scripts), for hinting (so the font renders well on older screens where pixel order - RGB vs BGR - mattered due to display orientation; shoutout to Microsoft for solving this with greyscale hinting on Windows 8 onwards, and screw you Apple for ignoring it and overriding our instructions with your own ugly and heavy instructions), and for making sure the font behaves properly in specific software (looking at you, InDesign and Office 365, for leaving long-reported bugs unfixed), or even on printers.\n\nPrinting introduces its own set of challenges due to driver differences - such as PCL versus PostScript - and how manufacturers implement these standards (HP and Xerox, this is on you; everyone should just buy OKI).\n\nThere was a time when specialized software was essential because older programs like FontLab 5 would crash with large glyphsets (being 32-bit, they were limited to 4GB of RAM). Projects involving CJK scripts are often outsourced to native studios partly for this reason - since most font development tools were not designed with non-English users in mind.\n\nThings are gradually improving with the re-introduction of Variable Fonts. These allow designers to move away from rigid weight/width/italic styles (like Regular, Bold, Italic) and instead use sliders along continuous axes. Fixed styles can now be generated from specific points on those sliders, which saves a lot of time. Still, even with these efficiencies, you should expect a full CJK project to require 12 months of dedicated work from a reasonably sized team—from concept to release - assuming, of course, no issues arise from any of the things I just mentioned.\n\n~~~\n\nSide rambling:\n\nI think the only non-CJK studio that designs CJK fonts fully in-house is Dalton Maag - but I'm not 100% certain on that. Monotype (yes, the company behind Helvetica), which is the largest player in the industry, doesn't really design much themselves anymore. Instead, they buy up the rights to hundreds of smaller foundries, absorb their IP, and then charge a premium to anyone who wants to use those fonts. They've been doing this since before digital fonts were a thing and have become something of an ominous corporate presence whenever their reps show up at design events, where people would rather they just weren't there - a bit like Adobe I suppose.\n\nI haven’t used FontLab since version 7, and even its 64-bit version was unreliable. Glyphs 3 performs better overall but has its own issues - including questionable/messy bloat in its proprietary file format, general instability, and an overemphasis on \"user-friendliness\" (think Microsoft Word levels of hand-holding which becomes intrusive for professionals compared to Indesign/Affinity Publisher). On top of that, Georg is a die-hard Mac evangelist, and his attitude - basically \"if you don't like my way, make your own editor\" - is exhausting. Unfortunately, his software remains the industry default simply because the best alternative, FontLab, is somehow worse, even though it’s cross-platform.\n\nTo make matters worse, FontLab's team has a frustrating pattern of promising fixes version after version, only to push a handful of them into the next paid upgrade cycle while leaving some other long standing ones for the one after that. \n\nThat’s why I’m cautiously optimistic about Fontra - an open-source, Chromium-based, Google-funded font editor that shows a lot of promise. If it gains traction, it could finally offer a way out of this editor drama. Since it’s open source, bugs and issues can actually be forked, patched, and merged upstream by the community. If anyone with dev experience is looking for a fun and impactful project to contribute to, I’d highly recommend checking it out. It's a really niche industry that actually requires a lot of technical knowledge:\n\nhttps://github.com/googlefonts/fontra",

They probably won’t notice 15min mess sleep, but if they use that 15min to make lunch to bring or eat, it’s 100000% better use of time. I eat a sandwich every day at our first break. It costs about $1.50 and takes 2 minutes to make. \n\nInstead they’re staying up til 4am and using every last minute to sleep.  Then I see campus store Monster and chips while listening to them complain that American food is unhealthy. If you’re going to live somewhere for months, it’s probably worth taking time to figure out how to eat decently.",

Billy is an elf, and you despise elves. What do you do?\"\n\n------\n\nOther than adding \"I\" and \"Billy\" to the mix, we only altered the punctuation, and we were able to construct quite a few different meanings. When colloquialisms, cultural references, and wordplay get thrown into the mix, direct translations become more or less impossible, meaning that the real content of the piece gets lost by default.\n\nYou can still end up with the same story and the same details, of course, but the tone, the meter, the deeper context, and everything else that differentiates \"writing\" from \"text-based content\" vanishes.\n\nThe monkeys might still enjoy it, though.",

Thought-for-thought rather than word-for-word.  After all, how can one 'translate' a word like 'frumious, which isn't a recognized word in any language, and yet in English carries the connotations of 'fuming-furious', which is in fact how Carroll intended it?  You could just leave it intact, but then the connotations are lost.  You could translate it literally from the source words; 'rauchend-wütend' condensed to, say 'wüchend', except that that means 'growing' and thus is an inaccurate translation.\n\nFascinating read, and honestly the whole book is worth your time.",

So these people are highly knowledgeable and motivated to negotiate for the right profit definitions. \n\nThese days it’s never “oh this entity lost money but our other shell company took all the profits.” The arguments are “this film made $105M. We thought it would break even at $100M but the contract says the studio can charge a 10% marketing fee to itself so the film just didn’t break even”. When a hit is a hit the backend pays out. Sometimes handsomely like RDJ on Marvel movies. \n\nSo yeah, if you’re a freelancer without an agent, I would mentally write down all contingent comp to $0.

Movie B has the leading star take a big fixed salary, but nothing else.\n\n  \nThus, it would make sense for you to shift all your profit from movie A to movie B wouldn't it? So what do you do? Let's say you need to buy a bunch of cameras or something, so you say \"These cameras cost $1 million, we'll put it under the movie A budget, and say that the cameras depreciated 80%, so we count $800k towards Movie A's budget. Movie B gets to use these cameras for free, since we already have them.\" \n\n  \nSo what ends up happening is that Movie A makes less money, and Movie B makes more money.

Few replies seem to understand accounting.\n\nRevenue made from the movie less the direct costs of making the movie equals gross profit.\n\nGross profit less all other expenses except tax equals net profit before tax.\n\nThe movie takes $100 M to make, that is all costs that can honestly be attributed to directly making the movie, this includes actors' pay, set workers' pay, construction, rentals.\n\nThe movie makes $300 M, then the gross profit is $200 M. If an actor negotiated a % of GP then it is a % of this $200 M.\n\nThe company that made the movie has heaps of other expenses, HQ rental and staff, marketing, accountants, researchers for movies that don't get made. These expenses include depreciation, interest costs, amortisation and other costs that do not get directly accounted for in GP. These expenses are the allocated to the GP, say these costs add up to $250 M in the year that this movie was released, and it is the only movie released that year, then the simple sum would be 200 minus 250 equals a loss of $50 M.\n\nMy point here is that it is very simple, and perfectly legal, to ensure that this movie lost money.\n\nWhy do this? Because depreciation and such like are not actual monetary costs now. Yes, it is a method for legitimately ensuring that you have the reserves to replace infrastructure that degrades over decades etc., etc., but until that happens the company directors and managers have received their bonuses and moved on.\n\nFurther, the movie company itself legally loses money, but the company that owns the movie company makes money. And that leads to the next point...\n\n\n\n2. Movie companies do more than make movies.\n\nWarner Bros makes more from their Movie World then they do from their actual movies. In this sense the movies are just marketing to get you to go to the park and do the Jurassic Park ride. So the movie production loses money, and that loss is a damned good tax deduction for the company that owns the movie production company, and that owning company makes money from other areas.\n\n  \nExample from another jurisdiction.\n\nI am an accountant in Australia\\*, so I don't know the US taxation law that well, but I do know the Australian law - and the Australian Taxation Act, Section 10 BL allows a 150% tax write-off for loses making movies because the government thinks that movies are a great advertisement for the country and lead to increased tourism. So if I have a company that invests $100 M into a movie and it very specifically does not make any profit, then I get to write off $150 M of my real company's revenue.\n\n  \n(\\*Qualified accountant, masters degree, worked as an analyst mostly, now retired since once I turned 50 no-one would employ me, but not allowed to get a pension until reach 60. So my tax knowledge is going to be dated.)",

The idea being to use androids to prep the planets until they meet the standards of luxury and comfort the spacers are used too so they can essentially avoid the hardships of doing it themselves. \n\nThe main kind of argument Asimov makes to the contrary is that such a situation would maintain a stagnated culture of essentially decadence that would ultimately lead to the downfall of humanity. He thinks that earthlings who have rejected the use of robots and are much more eusocial would be the ones able to perpetuate humanity into the future and continue to grow and innovate their cultures.",

But when watching the entire race you see so much more from trackside or aerial views.\n\nSame thing goes for other sports - hockey has done cameras on the refs helmets and it helps so how fast the plays move but you miss so much of the outside action because the refs are rightfully puck focused. It does help with the idea of 'how did they miss that, it was right there' but then you see the helmet cam and they were focused on a scrum that the puck left 3 seconds before.",

He would hang out by my recliner near a window where he caught bugs that wandered in.  After several weeks, he worked up the courage to hop on me and wander around.  Eventually, I would scoot him onto my hand and place him back on his windowsill.  This went on for a couple of months, to the point I named him Deion (after Deion Sanders) because he was so fast.\n\nWhen I moved out of that apartment, my wife discovered Deion hiding out in one of our moving boxes.  Since we were moving several states away & I figured he would never survive the trip, I caught him, told him goodbye, and put him in the bushes next to the door of \"his\" apartment.\n\nStill remember the little guy after all these years.",

But, im a bee lover. So I unlocked and opened the door, prepared to be late for where I was going. I opened the door to see the bee hovering, almost exactly at eye level, right in front of of the door. It even paused a second and I KNOW IT SEEMS CRAZY, but it seemed like he acknowledged me and there was this fucked up moment of connection before he buzzed back out into the fresh air. Maybe he only lived the summer, maybe he died the next day but I’ll never forget that bee, saving his life, and the connection we had in that second. It’s such a weird thing to say, but it changed my perspective and my whole life.",

I currently live in that same house that was once my grandparents' when they were alive. I'm looking right across the room where it happened as I type this. When I thought about that memory it occurred to me how strange it was to think about an insignificant little bug that lived and died 30 or so years ago as an individual, that I (or anyone) can specifically remember, rather than as a sort of abstract thing. Something that isn't true for the vast majority of humans who have ever lived. \n\nMaybe by posting this I'm immortalizing that little spider. That memory would otherwise die with me.",

The Empire could simply not park a star destroyer in every system they controlled. They didn't have a fleet nearly large enough. So imperial star destroyers were built to leave a lasting impression. If deterence did not work to inspire obedience, a single ISD had everything it needed to make a warning example of it, be it in space or on the ground, or to establish dominance over an average star system. But they weren't exactly great ships to go toe to toe with another capital warship. I think they were severely undergunned for capital ship combat. The rebel Mon Calamari cruisers just weren't even designed as warships.\n\nThe New Republic had a defensive fleet, to defend its worlds from outside aggression. The Empire had a terror fleet, to loom over its subjects heads as a damocles sword and quell insurgencies.\n\nIt might simply be that imperial doctrine and ship designs were largely unsuited for the tasks the New Republic had at hand and their doctrine.",

I think she'd *mostly* agree with this shower thought.\n\na chimpanzee, for example, will 100% scalp a baby chimp's head and feel absolutely nothing. They're social, live in groups, and look out for each-other, but don't feel empathy or remorse in the same way that humans do. \n\ndolphins are also social, and also look out for each-other, but they're also *comically* evil. Your average dolphin acts like a psychopath, because what we call psychopathy is simply what most animals are like.\n\nmeanwhile, humans often feel bad for something as simple as stepping on a bug. It's weird, but it's actually *true* that no other species would feel sympathy for a snail or personify an ant in the same way that we do.",

There were a bunch of different species of human* living simultaneously and interbreeding, creating all kinds of other goofy hybrids on the periphery that we will likely never know existed. If the \"gray aliens\" really do exist, they're clearly a highly intelligent, timid, squirrelly little hominin that evolved to be nocturnal, perhaps to avoid competition with bigger hominins. This could explain the humanoid form, pale skin, large light gathering eyes, complete disinterest in the surface during the day, and their distrust of us. Perhaps the most disquieting of all though, if the others are our closest living relatives it would make all that cringe abductee lore about the collection of genetic materials and hybridization much more plausible than if we were talking about literal space aliens that aren't even made of DNA. \n\nCheck out the books The Cryptoterrestrials: a meditation on indigenous humanoids and the aliens among us, by Mac Tonnies. As well as, Invisible Residents: a disquisition on certain matters maritime and the possibility of intelligent life under the waters of the earth, by Ivan T Sanderson.\n\n(*All hominins of the genus homo are human, neanderthals, neledi, floresiensis ect were all human.)",

Additionally all of that information is covered in highschool or earlier.\n\nAnother bit that would be helpful but which I had to Google is that the distance from the planet to the sun is 1/63240 of the distance light travels over the course of one orbital period.",

They can still see red and they can still see green, it's just that they lack the ability to reliably distinguish these colors.  So in a society where everyone was color blind, they wouldn't have different names for red and green.  Instead, they might refer to grass as being \"light bluish-green\" while blood might be \"dark green\" or something.

They can overclock/underclock themselves at will, so they can complete hours worth of work in a few minutes, and many prefer to be overclocked because they feel that operating at \"real-time\" speed feels too slow.\n\nThis plays into tensions rising between the UIs (uploaded intelligences) and the people still living in the material world.",

It's also too finicky and too expensive.\n\nA few recent standouts for collectability have emerged though. I think the first gen Lexus LS400 is collector worthy. So is any Mercedes or BMW from the 1970s to mid 1980s. (except the 240D. It's unsafe as its incredibly slow) The 80s Chevy Caprice, and the Jeep Cherokee Classic have all aged incredibly well.\n\nI am told that the 90's Buicks are great sleeper vehicles that hold up incredibly well, but it's tough to be excited about them.

It is essentially imperceptible to a human. You think it is heavier because the mass has been compressed into a smaller area, so it feels more dense, but it is essentially the same weight. If you had a perfect scale you would see a difference. \n\nThe better demonstration, in my opinion, for showing cool physics/chemistry that challenge your assumption; place steel wool on a scale and light it on fire. Observe and explain the readings on the scale. With something like time dilation and measuring the difference in mass because of atom configuration or EM fields (mass is the resistance to motion, not the amount of 'stuff'), it can be hard to practically demonstrate. A little less now with time dilation since kinetic time dilation is a more powerful effect than gravitational time dilation - so the clocks on the space station do tick slower enough to be easily observed.",

That's absolutely wild.\n\nWhat alternative do you want? What would impress you? Literal magic? Do I need to get a spellbook out?

(I wore contact lenses for a good part of that time but eventually decided glasses were the less annoying option despite their drawbacks.)\n\nMe to surgeon: \"So what happens if I move my eyes during the procedure?\"  \nSurgeon: \"I'll probably fuck something up, so don't do that.\"  \nNarrator: He didn't do that.",

Antlers are for showing off, finding a mate, and fighting for their love. After mating season is over, they shed them because they have no need to fight or to gets does.\n\nHere’s the thing, male deer are stupid, it is incredibly common for male deer to fuck until their heart bursts, if they can pull the ladies, then they do what they do. After mating season they are often so tired that they don’t have the energy to make it through the winter, so shedding the antlers also gets rid of a lot of extra weight. During mating season when does and fawns are getting fat and getting fucked, the male deer are only looking for sex, they literally forget to eat, they ACTUALLY kill themselves for some Deerussy.\n\nEspecially because mating season and hunting season coincides. So while they are running from wild predators, they are also dealing with hunters. So the older deer who are smart enough to sex up all the does as well as survive the winter, they also have to deal with hunters trying to kill specifically those ones. Because those ones are the ones with the biggest antlers.\n\nThat’s why a US states DWR should make laws so that we can only hunt bucks with a certain size of rack, because we are killing all the small bucks before they get the chance. As a hunter I’m tired of seeing thousands of Does and only a dozen or so bucks out when I’m hunting.",

We had a long conversation about grief that day, as I had just lost my father in law.\n\nI gave a cookie to a little boy and his dad asked me if we sold individual cupcakes at our bakery. It was his son’s first birthday. He started crying these kind of happy-manic-relieved tears and told me the boy’s mom died nine months ago and he was just so proud he’d managed to make it to the end of year one. There was this bittersweet elation in his voice that I think about a lot.\n\nI was happy to be there for each of these people. They all needed someone to talk to and I was someone.

One is that the toothpaste, due to pressure being applied unevenly across the surface area of the tube, is gathering in parts of the tube that can store more volume than their appearance lets on. I think this is due to the odd shape of most tubes which is a cylinder that tapers down into a two point line. There is always a lot more toothpaste left in the head of the tube than you think! \n\nThe other factor is that, at least for myself, I start becoming conscious that the tube is running low and so I start using a bit less each time I brush. That combined with there being more left in the tube than it appears could mean you think you're down to 20% but you're really still at 45% and you start using less so it takes 50% longer to use up the remainder.",

        "body": "Oh you wanna know my story? Well, strap in, kid, you're in for a ride. Here's a secret - I'm not from this world. I got hit by a truck and died and got reincarnated here. You would think all these mangas and light novels were onto something, that's what I thought. That I get to be a hero and be teleported home when I beat the big bad evil dark lord.\n\nGuess what, that goddess wouldn't even talk to me. Much less grant me any powers or blessings or gear. So, all I got is some cloth on me, and a pouch of ten coins.\n\nBut unlike these peasants here, I ain't stupid. You see, I passed high school. Which doesn't exist in this old medieval magic world. So, I picked up some sticks and sold them as beginner weapons at two coins each. Kinda like the old times I was selling lemonade by the street. Just one juicer, one bicycle and a cardboard sign.\n\nI'm a merchant, not an adventurer. Just not cut out for it. My stats are crap. Like worse than common slime shit. Anything could kill me in one hit or two.\n\nNow, why am I telling you this?\n\nI'm bored.\n\nIf its all just gibberish to you, just take me for a drunken old equipment merchant. Pay up, take your new shiny sword, and go on your way.\n\nNow, if you understood all that, you know what isekai and high school are, I got a deal for you. I'm coming along. I will be your gear guy. If there's one stat I have that doesnt suck, I have high encumberance. Let me carry your gear. Enhance it. I will do it at a highly discounted rate.\n\nI ain't those typical merchants who would insist on charging the highest prices around. Even as their city is collapsing into darkness and you're the only adventurer in the area.\n\nThen, maybe if you're the Chosen One to beat the dark lord, we could both go home.\n\n\"I want to stay here.\"\n\nWhat.\n\n\"There's so many side quests! I don't have a boss breathing down my neck, giving me ridiculous deadlines! So anyway, I'm buying all your swords to complete my weapon glossary.\"\n\nWait, does that mean you already found the ultra secret hidden Sword of The Ancients?\n\n\"That one? Yea, did that quest already.\"\n\nWhat is your plan, adventurer?\n\n\"I'm going fishing. Need to complete my glossary, get my 100% achievements, dude.\"\n\n----\n\n[Thanks for reading!

        "body": "I could only watch, painfully, as young sorcerers danced flames upon their fingertips in the pastures before me. Swords clashed, blades shimmering in the sunlight, as they honed their skills. Dark orbs swooshed through the air. The greatest among these recruits would delve into dungeons, where unknown treasures promised glory, fame and most importantly, coin. \n\nIn my fingertips rested a quill, dancing upon parchment instead. No flames could burst like wildfire out of my hands, but I could twirl the quill, a neat trick I picked up in elementary school. It was then and there that I acquired friends, a snot-nosed girlfriend, and street credibility, only to lose it all when the next kid could do a backflip. Somewhat reminiscent of my situation now, minus the magic. And my parent’s financial backing.  \n\n“Karta!” Veras called, his armor clinking as he ran to me. \n\nHe looked like your typical adventurer, covered with steel plating everywhere but his vitals, tousled black hair, and a grin full of hope.  \n\n“Yo.” I replied. \n\n“Yo? What does that mean?” \n\n“Never mind. How’s the practice going?” \n\nVeras glanced over at the chaos. “Good. Sylas won against Lin, and Gerald won against Berald. Hales won against...” \n\nI scrawled upon the parchment furiously. Excitement bubbled within my chest, and I could hardly contain myself as ink splotched across the paper. The algorithm was working. They had levels, I was damn near sure of it, and skills. Each member won and lost by my whims, at the mercy of my scribbled marks. Last month the party grew seven percent stronger, but now – seventeen percent. Nothing would stop me now. \n\n“Are you listening?” Veras asked. \n\n“I’m more than listening.” \n\nI stood up, brushing off my muddy cloak, and returned his beaming grin. “We’re ready, Veras. The dungeon awaits.” ",

        "body": "After all those fantasy novels, video games and lit rpg books, I was ecstatic to wake up in a swords and sorcery setting.  Come to think of it. I was happy to be waking up at all.  I was driving home from work  when some idiot ran a red light and...  Well. It wasn't pretty. It wasn't instant like in the stories. I knew I wasn't going to make it and I was right.  I would have thought I'd have been terrified, but mostly I was just really  REALLY annoyed.  Two more months and I'd have been able to retire.  All those years of  taking care of myself, being a responsible adult and saving for retirement.  \nAll that exercise... All those stupid salads... I'm just saying I could have slept in and eaten WAY more Ice Cream. What a waste.\n\n\nAnyway when I woke up in a clearing in the woods that looked like something right out of a fairy tale, I thought it must be the oxygen deprived hallucinations of my dying brain. I sat there for like an hour watching the waterfall cascading down the mountains in the distance waiting for the end.  It never came.   \n\nWhen it finally dawned on me what had happened I was so excited. I was young again. I was healthier than I ever was in my prime and  I'd been dropped into a new world. \nI had a tunic, a dagger and a pack with a few provisions.  I even had stats!\n\nIt took about a week to realize I wasn't going to be some new hero.  I have all the killer instincts of a lawn chair.  I got mugged by some pimple faced kid an hour after I hit the first town.  Some chosen hero... right? \n\nThe only advantage I turned out to have was my education and years of reading.   My first success was convincing a blacksmith to try a few things.  When he learned how to make steel, even in small quantities he made a small fortune. The local alchemist knew how to make healing potions, but had never heard of soap, or toothpaste.   The wizard could shoot lightning bolts out of his fingers but he had no idea that electricity could be used for anything other than a weapon. A couple of days with the local glass blower and I managed to make a crude plasma globe.  I've yet to come up with a really good local material to insulate wire so there's a lot I can't do with it yet, but almost every wizard has a plasma globe on their staff these days.  \n\n\nSoon the village prospered and the King's tax assessors took note and the King's scholars turned up not long after.  They invited me to come work for the King.  The invitation wasn't optional but I went eagerly.  I was nervous but I knew that serving the King would most likely be a better life than I could hope for in any village.    \n\nCompared to most of the monarchs in my own world's history the King is actually a good ruler.. The King's father had  heard tales of outworlders with strange knowledge.  They've had people keeping an eye out for folks like us for decades.  I thought that he'd only be interested in weapons but when you have people who ride dragons into battle and can throw lightning a crossbow or a gun doesn't seem all that impressive. \n\n\nIt's taken a long time but now the farmers rotate their crops. Telegraph lines crisscross the Kingdom. Adventurers now respond in days rather than weeks. \nI introduced the metal lathe, the printing press and something that passes for germ theory although most still don't quite believe in tiny bacteria they can't see.  The childhood death rate in the more remote parts of the kingdom has plummeted to almost nothing over the last decade. \n\nMost of the homes in the capitol have indoor plumbing now with flushing toilets and hot showers. There are even a couple of short railways. \n\n\n\n\nIt's not the adventure I expected, but it has been a good life, and with access to magical healers, it looks like it is likely to be a long one.  \n\n\nWhy am I telling you all this?  Well, you see there have been rumors of a clumsy but bright new stranger who seems to have the oddest ideas that always seem to work. \n\nHow would you like to see the capitol?",

        "body": "(1/2)\n\nMason had never really thought of himself as the philosophical kind. But as he watched the decapitated head of the Orc Chief sail through the air, he couldn’t help but marvel at the ability of the human mind to get used to anything. \n\nAround him, the forest clearing was a mess. Smoke drifted from patches of burnt grass where sorcery had struck. Trees lay felled at odd angles, their trunks split open from summoned lightning strikes. And the blood. So much blood. An entire tribe of Orcs had ambushed his party and had suffered dearly for it. Dismembered limbs lay strewn around, organ entrails spooled out from bisected torsos, and every blade of grass was splattered with red. He watched from a safe distance as Kale stepped over to an Orc warrior drawing their last rattling breath and jammed a spear through the large green monster, finally plunging the clearing into silence. \n\nMason waited for the rush of sorrow and disgust that had once gripped him in the face of such sights. It never came. How many such massacres had he seen now? It couldn’t have been more than a few months since him and Kale had ended up in this world, but it felt like it’d been a lifetime. He sighed. Whatever.\n\n“Let’s go,” he said, turning to look down at Zell. The she-elf had been seated behind him, back turned to the fighting. Legs crossed, eyes closed, she was ostensibly “meditating” to condense the mana in the air to help her party members cast stronger spells. Mason suspected it was all just an elaborate act to avoid the fighting and bloodshed. Indeed as she stood up and turned around, brushing the dirt off of her flowing gown, her face blanched as she took in the slaughter. \n\n“We should hurry,” he said, thrusting a sack into her arms. “Those corpses won’t stick around forever, you know.” \n\nHer eyes flicked away from the corpses to him and he felt an irrational fluttering in his stomach. Damn, she was beautiful. Her pale skin was almost luminescent, and her storm-grey eyes glittered hypnotically in the fading sunlight. Her golden hair floated around her as if unaffected by gravity, the telltale mark of an elf, and he could just make out the tips of her pointy ears from under her swirling tresses. Under any other circumstances, being the only other support member on a party with someone as pretty as Zell would’ve excited him. If it weren’t for one small detail…\n\n“Spare me the lecture,” Zell snapped, snatching up the sack. “I don’t need the party leech to tell me how to do my job.” \n\nRight. She hated him.\n\nHe watched her march off to the nearest Orc corpse and begin harvesting crystals from its carapace. The corpse would disintegrate soon but before it vanished, small crystals could be worked out from underneath the hard carapace around their shoulders that they wore for armor. A handful of those crystals would fetch a hefty amount of gold. Today’s slaughter was nothing if not profitable.\n\n“Well,” Mason muttered under his breath, “might as well earn my keep too.” He made his way to the opposite end of the clearing from Zell, trying to put as much distance between them. As he did, he passed close enough to hear Kale celebrating with his…well…his *harem*. There was no other word for it. What else could one call the gaggle of scantily clad, all-female warriors that had sworn their hearts and blades to his friend?\n\n“You were amazing back there, Kale!” Aliya squealed. The demi-human mage flung herself at Kale, her tail wagging behind her. It was hard to remember she once tried to kill them, only surrendering when Kale disarmed her.\n\n“Get off of him,” Saya growled, yanking Aliya back. The tall, tan warrior composed herself before shyly turning back to Kale. “You really were amazing!” she said, fluttering her eyes. “Was that a new sword move you used on the Chief?” She leaned into Kale, and Mason was all too aware of her armor that barely covered any skin. How did that even logistically make sense? \n\n“Stop rubbing up against him,” Aqua snarled, pushing herself between Kale and Saya. The underworld assassin was clad in a skin-tight garment that hid nothing. “He needs some space!” Only a few weeks ago she’d tracked them down on an assasination contract. All it had taken to change her mind was Kale stopping one of her flung daggers and patting her on her head. Mason still had no clue how that worked.\n\nHe shook his head and moved on. Kale was living every teenage boy’s dream, but sometimes it genuinely seemed like more of a pain in the ass. Oh well, at least he -\n\n“Mason! Hey, Mason!” \n\nMason turned to see Kale work himself free of the trio of girls that were glaring daggers at each other and jog towards him. His friend’s clothes were drenched in blood, and specks of red freckled his face. He was smiling.\n\n“Hey, wasn’t that awesome!” he said, laughing as he came to a halt. “We totally demolished those Orcs! But man, I’m exhausted now.” He ran his hands through his dark hair, subconsciously glancing at the girls to see if they’d noticed. He’d been doing that a lot lately. \n\n“Yeah,” Mason said, looking at the carnage around them. “You really gave it to them.” He glanced at the sword strapped at Kale’s waist. Ankosia, the thrice-blessed blade that had been bestowed upon Kale when they’d transmigrated to this world. The divine artifact had made his friend the de-facto strongest person around from the moment they’d arrived. Mason had gotten a compass. Admittedly, it was a magical compass that helped guide you to your destination, but it paled in comparison to a sword of limitless power.\n\n“Was it a new move?” Mason asked, in-spite of himself. “The one you used on the Chief?”\n\n“Huh?” Kale said, dragging his eyes away from the girls. “Sorry, what’d you say?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Ah, okay.” Kale rubbed his palms together. “Listen, I managed to get some good information from the Orc Chief before he kicked the bucket. You don’t need to know the details, but there’s apparently some crazy loot back at their castle. Can you get us there with your compass?”\n\n*You don’t need to know the details.*\n\n“Right,” Mason said after a moment’s pause. “Yeah, I can do that. I’ll need to know -”\n\n“Great!” Kale said, clapping his shoulders. One of the girls called out to him and he turned to wave at them. “Coming,” he called back. Turning to Mason once more he smiled, and Mason couldn’t help but notice there was even Orc blood on Kale’s teeth. “And hey, another thing. Work with Zell on charting our course. She has a knack for navigating these woods, and I’d like a few uneventful nights without nasty surprises.” Without waiting for confirmation, he slapped Mason on the shoulders again and jogged back to the girls.\n\nMason stood still for a few seconds, before turning and trudging to a disintegrating corpse to salvage what crystals he could. Behind him, the clearing rang with laughter as Kale made some joke.\n\n*Don’t let it bother you*, he thought to himself. *Without him you’d be out on the streets on your ass. You know that.* It was a bitter pill to swallow, even though it was true. Kale was his friend. He was powerful enough to not need Mason’s help but he kept him in the party even though everyone else thought he was deadweight. He tried to squash the ugly feelings bubbling up in him, but it was getting harder by the day.",

I started to bring up my folder of documents when he flipped over the page to continue, citing forms for extra-dimensional travel, numerous alien vaccinations and known magical resistances.  I blinked a few times, looking at the meager documents I had brought and felt the distinct lack of weight in my hands. He met my eyes, seeing the panic already building up in them and smiled reassuringly.\n\n\"If you're missing any of the required forms, there are simple workarounds that can be used in their place.\"  My brows must've furrowed in confusion when he elaborated. \"A simple test of your primary power,\" he paused to check his notes, nodding to himself, \"it says here super-strength, and we can proceed with the rest of the intake.\"\n\nHe gestured to the machine behind him, motioning me to stand under the bar and place my feet in the indicated painted icons of footprints.  Putting my measly folder on a shelf and assuming the position, he pressed a button and I was suddenly pressing against the incredible downward force of the machine, trying to avoid being crushed under the intense pressure.  The official merely watched, glancing at the screen that was updating with the ongoing results.  Apparently it reached a satisfactory level and he pressed the red button, ending the test and resetting the machine back to its original position. He paused to pick up the folder I had placed down, rapidly going through the materials I had brought, checking off a few boxes and swiftly counting the missing ones as I regained my breath.\n\n\"You're short a few.  I can take care of them of a small fee,\" he said quietly.\n\n\"How small?\" I asked.\n\nHis smile never waivered.  \"If you can pay today, I charge ten thousand per document.  If you don't have that kind of money now, the cost goes up to fifty thousand, payable within one year.  You should be able to swing that on a new hero's salary.\"\n\nI knew when I was defeated, so I nodded glumly.  \"I'll take the second option.  How much do I need to pay by year's end?\"\n\nHis smile widened slightly.  \"I'll make you a deal.  Pay me an even million and you'll be at work by tomorrow.\"\n\nIt was then that I learned that not all villains wore capes, cloaks or even costumes.  The real ones worked for the government.",

Yet we're too horrified and confused to stop him as he struggled to find the next name in his rubric. \n\n\"Uhhhh....Z.... Zeeeeee...  ahHA!\" He shouted as the name came rushing back into his mind. A smirk, sharp as it was coy, could barely be seen through the thick homage to Magnum Pi that grew beneath his perfectly symmetrical nose.\n\n\"I need to see, Z.

        "body": "\"What in the seven hells is going on here?!\" screeched Tula, one of the older residents.\n\nGaia was just wondering the same thing, but she did not feel the need to express it so abrasively. She was in the middle of serving another round of beers at a table in the middle of the hall when it happened. The air grew dense all of a sudden—it was as if she had just plunged underwater, but without the cold or the wet. She also began seeing a—*what's the word I'm looking for… aura?*—she thought, around every single object. A blue tint surrounding the silhouette of the mugs she carried, and around the tray, and then in every other object around the room. It messed up her vision. She blinked hard, but it did not change anything.\n\n\"This is trippy,\" said Oak, whom she had just served, waving his hands in front of his face. \"I'm not drunk enough, am I?\"\n\n\"I don't think so, Mr. Oak, this is only your second beer,\" said Gaia.\n\n\"What's the matter?\" asked Uman, who sat in front of him. He was a *hinai*, with the typical light blue skin with splotches of dark blue, like a cow, and his face also reminded her of one. Even on slow days like these, Gaia liked when the *hinai* came, for he could drink as much as ten men.\n\n\"Aren't you seeing this?\" asked Oak. \"This… this *thing*? The air is thick, and there's blue everywhere!\" he explained.\n\n\"Oh? Ha! It's happening then, we're all going back home! The great Orgaion is preparing the field!\" said Uman.\n\n\"The field? What are you talking about? I knew you people would never cease to cause trouble!\" complained Tuna. She had resented the newcomers since they arrived, all those years ago.\n\n\"The wizard is working on a spell to take us home, old woman, you'll finally be happy, ha!\" said Uman.\n\n\"But why is it affecting us?\" asked Gaia. *I don't want to leave my inn*, she thought.\n\n\"I don't know, really, but I guess it means it's working. Oh, don't look like that! I'm sure the spell wouldn't work on you people even if he wanted it to!\"\n\n\"But what if it does? We need to stop that old bastard!\" said Tuna, standing up and trudging outside.\n\n\"It's best we find out what's going on, Oak, come on,\"  said Gaia, unwrapping her apron and leaving it on the counter beside the tray. Her head was starting to hurt from the weirdness in her vision, and she began seeing double.\n\n\"Come on, people! Calm down!\" protested Uman, but they were already out the door.\n\nThe wizard's tower was not too far from the inn, but nothing was too far in the small village of Aigi. They went up the street towards the tower, its black top looming in the distance. There was a beacon of blue light shining from its top, and a swirl of clouds began forming in the sky above it. They must've not been the only ones feeling and seeing it, for it seemed that everyone in the village that could walk was going toward the tower.\n\nGaia heard angry mutters and complaints about the wizard and all of the newcomer's mischief. She wondered why they were still called newcomers after all these years, but the thought didn't last long when she noticed that the blue aura was becoming stronger. Each leaf was surrounded by a thick blue line, in such a way that changed the plant's entire hue. Another effect started happening, the air seemed to grow *thicker* with each step. Each step was a little harder. She felt like she was walking in oil now. When they were just ten steps away from the tower it felt like moving through mud.\n\nShe heard angry shouts around her.\n\n\"Show yourself, wizard!\"\n\n\"Stop this madness!\"\n\n\"Who do you think you are?!\"\n\nAnd many others containing worse curses. She herself did not say anything, but she crossed her arms and looked intensively at the tower's balcony.\n\nThey were shouting and clamoring for over ten minutes, but the *umqo* was nowhere to be seen. Finally, when when people began kicking the wizard's door, he appeared with a flourish and a bow.\n\n---\nto be continued",

        "body": "Her vision was getting blurry. A night out killing goblins of all kinds, including hobgoblins and bugbears, has left the party and her in a dreary, dissident mood.\n\n\"It's never going to end, is it?\", Alyssa was the first to address the elephant in the room, \"He is just going to keep sending us on missions until we're all dead.\"\n\nTo her right, the dead body of his fallen mage, a man of valor and royalty, now nothing but a rotting corpse. She approached the dead man, examining Waldor, still in disbelief that a mere spear from a Hobgoblins penetrated his defenses. Waldor's eyes were crimson red, like the blood that poured out of his left side, smack dab of the heart. He had soiled himself.\n\nThe only thing Silvana, the leader of the group and one of the most respected Goblin Hunters on the archipelago, could do, was close his eyes. Waldor deserved better.\n\nThe hunting islands were spanning thousands of miles to every direction, ever since the tectonic plates decided to go haywire, splitting the Earth into many pieces, some large as ancient countries were described in history textbooks and anthropology, others no bigger than a speck of land.\n\nThere was no escape. The goblins, who had built an underground society, biding their time, waiting for their day, secure in their belief that they'll conquer humanity one day. They, they were right.\n\nMuch of the islands were under their control, rumoured to be led by the all-powerful Goblin King, a shaman of great intelligence that had risen above and given the goblins something they lacked, but humans always had: plans, codes, mores, law.\n\nFrom a fringe group, the Goblin King was able to form a uniform military machine, akin to what Alexander the Great did, or so the textbooks of ancient times say.\n\nIt was time to go home. Alyssa shook her head in frustration - nobody even acknowledged her woes for they knew she was right and they knew that no 'talking it over' would change the Lord's decision.\n\nMulling over it was simply a waste of time and Alyssa understood that, especially amongst battlehardened warriors, blabber of any kind is not appreciated.\n\nThey would have gone rogue. They would one day or so Silvana had promised, but the outlooks were bleak. Humanity had united into one, but when there's only one hand that rules them all, there's no discourse or democracy.\n\nReturning home, the castle walls could be seen from miles away, huge swaths of brick constructed to keep the green pests at bay. \n\nThey were there to collect today's bounty and to pay respect to Waldor, the fallen mage. The Code stipulated all fallen warriors, especially those wielding magic, had to be inspected by the Lord himself.\n\nEntering the lavish chambers of their Lord, the party had murderous intent on their minds. Especially Alyssa, who had crushed on Waldor ever since he taught her how to successfully perform fire strikes. The burns on her left palm serve as a bitter memory of their time together. To him, she may have been nothing but an apprentice, but to her, his beating heart was her beating heart.\n\nThe Lord greeted them cordially, inviting the seven-man army into his chambers. The six-man group stood silent, presenting Waldor as if a gift to the Lord.\n\nAlyssa was holding back tears, but they streamed anyways. The billowing rage growing inside her made her head pound with anticipation, much like during a hunt. Maybe I'll be hunting something other than goblin tonight, she thought.\n\nThe Lord dared touch Waldor, sucking the magic force out of his rotting body, to which the room exploded. \n\nAlyssa couldn't hold back anymore: to desecrate a dead man's corpse was nothing short of suicide for a commoner and now she had to watch the love of her life wither away into fine dust?\n\nToo. Fucking. Much.\n\nInvoking all her might, she cast a blazing inferno resembling hell itself. Never had the group witnessed such a ferocious attack, not even when Alyssa was close to the Reaper during hunts.\n\nThe Lord extended one arm and easily blocked the attack.\n\nHe wasn't angry, it was more of a condescending sort of aura he was giving away that troubled the hunters.\n\n\"Don't you remember, my dear Alyssa? This armor isn't meant to protect me from your magic. It's meant to protect your magic from me.\"\n\nSilvana was confused. Why hadn't he killed them all right there on the spot? Better yet, why wasn't he out on the front, fighting with them side by side. With his magic skills, they could've wiped out the goblins for good.\n\nThen it hit her: It wasn't royal privilege or something beneath a Lord to hunt, it was merely spite and jealousy over Alyssa's choice, the choice she made when she rejected him and chose Waldor. That's why the repeated hunts. That's why he had to die.\n\nNow that Waldor was a part of the Lord, would Alyssa fall for him?",

If it wasn't, you wasted your life. The onslaught grew more brutal. Your options were certain death or uncertainty. Comfort with uncertainty was needed.\n\nMoving closer, you began to make out letters in the light. They shifted and moved to every language, but the message was the same. At a closer distance, you saw noble steeds in front. Other warriors had found it. The smell of treasure reached your nose. \n\nAs you neared the entrance, nature summoned one last push. A bolt of lightning struck before you leaving a black mark on the ground. You leapt backward in terror. Perhaps you were unworthy all along. \n\nNo, it was too late for doubts. Few considered the possibility that you would achieve your goal. Standing before this holy place was an accomplishment.

In the distance, the croaking of frogs played off the cawing of crows. \"What is it you two seek to forget, what painful memories must you rid yourselves of?\"\n\nThe couple shared a glance. \"Our daughter.\" \n\nMary stopped for a moment, her gaze dropping to the ground in front of her, hands clasping together, whispering something indistinctly. When she was finished, she looked back up towards her hut in the distance. \"It can be done. Do you have a lock of her hair? A belonging of your daughters? Something that is connected to her physical or spiritual being?\" She asked without turning around, still walking towards their destination.\n\nThe couple rummaged through their bag as they walked, removing an old envelope. \"We have her hair, though it is from many years ago.\"\n\n\"It matters not.\" Mary said as she stopped outside her hut, taking the envelope with care. \"Whether the hair was just removed, or removed ages ago, the incantation will take to it.\" The door creaked as it opened, revealing the inside of the hut to be much larger than it appeared to be on the outside. \n\nInside, Mary's hut was lined with various jars, most stuffed full of herbs, flowers, and preserved organic materials. By the fireplace sat a pot, already boiling, with a table beside it. There, Mary placed the envelope and invited the couple to take a seat before her, holding a hand upon her upper thigh; a vain attempt to stifle the pain she felt. \n\n\"You come to me today to forget. To remove the painful memories, as most do.\" Her spindly finger pointed, poking the middle of the man's forehead. \"With your payment,\" she said as she poked the woman's head, \"and yours, we shall begin.\"\n\nMary felt a rush of cold wash over her as the payment flowed through her, invigorating her. The pain in her leg subsided, finally. She shook her head and continued, removing the hair from the envelope and sprinkling it into the boiling pot. It sizzled, oddly enough.\n\nMary began.\n\n>\"By root of shade and tear of night,\n\n>By waning moon and veiled sight,\n\n>I stir the depths where memories drown,\n\n>Let silence rise and sorrow down.\"\n\nShe drew from her jar of poppy flowers and scooped a handful of ash from an extinguished brazier. Slowly as she continued, she added the ingredients to the boiling pot.\n\n>\"With poppy’s kiss and ash from flame,\n\n>I call the void and speak no name.\n\n>Let burden break, let chains be gone,\n\n>Unmoor the past, where grief was drawn.\"\n\nThe couple watched with enchanted wonder as Mary continued, drawing forth a halved femur bone, scooping the marrow out before taking a small tincture of what seemed to be nothing.\n\n>\"Mist and marrow, bind this spell,\n\n>Unmake the tale I dare not tell.\n\n>With one sip deep, let heart forget,\n\n>What once was known, be vanished yet.\"\n\nAs Mary finished, there was a small green wisp that flew up out of the pot and vanished almost immediately. The Witch poured the concoction into three different cups, offering one to the each of her audience members before her, and keeping one for herself. \n\nThe brew smelled rancid, but its taste was as sweet as summer pie. The couple shared a knowing glance and emptied the contents of the cups, drinking to forget.\n\nMary watched, and as they swallowed, she drank from hers, sipping slowly. As she sipped, images began appearing in her mind's eye. A young girl, blonde, no older than six or seven. She was playing, running around their home. Mary almost laughed at the child's delight, enjoying this sweet memory.\n\nFor a moment, she wondered why they would want to forget something so blissful. However, it became clear when the young girl -- Desmona, as Mary suddenly recalled -- tripped as she ran, falling straight into the fireplace and impaling herself on the cast iron poker. She was engulfed almost immediately. Despite Mary's attempts to save her, she failed, and her daughter passed away in her arms. \n\nMary shook her head, wiping tears away from her face. She glanced to the couple who stared at her, both seemingly forgetting where they were. \n\n\"You may go.\" Mary said solemnly. \"Your price has been paid, as has mine. Leave, and never come back, obey the warning signs, for your time in my abode is past.\"\n\nThe couple nodded, and left her shack.\n\nMary fell into one of the two chairs, uncorking a bottle of a milky-white fluid as she mourned for Desmona.",

        "body": "[Part 1 of 2]\n\n\n\n\nYou couldn’t walk three steps through the cursed forest without bumping into one of Sir. Erinson’s warning signs. The wooden boards pinned to the trees, stabbed into the dirt, and even left hanging from the tree’s branches. No matter what height you were, or what route you took, you would always run into at least four of his warnings on your travels. The warnings were all similar, having some variation of ‘Dangerous witch lives in this area. Please follow the main road and avoid cutting through the cursed forest.’\n\n \n\nThough, he soon realized that not everyone could read, which is why he had to hastily draw the witch onto every board he could find. The drawing he created of the witch being incredible. Fitting of a man with many noble talents. He sketched her beauty perfectly. The radiance of her lime green skin, the way she had a few dark freckles beneath her golden eyes. The way her chin had that dangerous point, everything about the drawing adding to her beauty, and no amount of red markings across her face would stop the curious travelers from seeking her.\n\n \n\nToday was like any other day for Eric Erinson. The man standing on the outskirts of the witch’s cottage, ignoring the woman as she hummed a deep tune, watering her velvet flowers. The witch had attempted to speak to the adventurer occasionally, but he always ignored her, acting as if she didn’t exist, which only furthered her curiosity towards the strange, armored man.\n\n \n\n“AH!” a voice shouted from the depths of the forest. Eric dashed into the darkness of the cursed forest, ignoring the ghostly wails he heard as he jumped over logs and bushes, trying to locate the source of the sound before it was too late. The source of the sound was a chubby elderly fellow, who was hanging upside down with only his flushed face being visible. The rest of his body being lodged in the mouth of a giant man-eating plant, one with a bulb shaped head, and tiny black eyes.\n\n \n\nWhen the plant spotted Eric, its mouth twitched, swirling the man’s body in its salivating mouth in the same manner that a sommelier would swirl a mouthful of wine. After a good swirl of his body, it spat the man onto the grass, dropping him before Eric’s feet.\n\n \n\nThe man shivered, his neat clothes covered in small holes from where the creature’s saliva had melted it. Some of his skin had also blistered, getting irritated by the monsters’ spit. The raw skin a sickening red, mirroring the color of a bad sunburn. “Oh, gods. What is that thing? That’s not the witch.” He squealed, struggling to pick his frightened body off the floor. He dug his fingers into the dirt, pushing at the soil, only to fall again, further dirtying his top. \n\n“No, it’s not. I call it a Chomper. I assume it has another name, though I don’t care to learn it.” Eric and the Chomper gazed at one another, before the Chomper retreated. The creature had seen Eric cut down enough of the forests monsters in the past, knowing better than to mess with the man. Its roots dragging it through the forest, while Eric didn’t give chase, seeing no reason to kill a creature that was retreating. After all, it wasn’t the monster’s fault that food kept walking into its home. That’s why he would only kill them if they refused to free the humans from their grasp.\n \n“A Chomper? W-was it going to eat me?” The man pushed himself to his feet, legs wobbling, still remembering how it had felt to be trapped inside the intense heat of the creature’s mouth, feeling his body slowly cook as its horrid spiked tongue dragged against his skin, tasting its future feast.\n \nEric, in the past, had shown sympathy to those who had been traumatised by the monsters, though since this was his 120th rescue, he wasn’t feeling as patient. He grabbed the man by his collar, only for the collar to dissolve between his fingers, forcing him to grab the scruff of the man’s thin beard. “WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU THINKING? WHAT IS IT THAT ENTICES YOU ALL TO COME HERE? SHE IS A WITCH. A WITCH! DO YOU THINK I LIKE GUARDING THIS PLACE FROM YOU IDIOTS?.” By the time Eric had finished shouting, his throat was as raw as the man’s cooked skin, gagging slightly as he struggled to hold his rage.\n \n“WAH. I’m so sorry. I thought the beautiful witch may be interested in becoming my bride. You see, I’m not like other humans. I’m open to marrying monsters. This is a new age, monsters aren’t only-“ The man cut his speech short, noticing the intense hatred flowing through the noble’s eyes. The red lines in Eric’s eyeballs, being a telling sign that something the man had said caused him to burst a blood vessel or two, and that if he kept continuing, he would end up seeing red in both the literal and metaphorical sense. “I’ll never return here again.” The elderly man promised.\n\n“Good.” Eric huffed, throat stinging as he said it. He released the man and pointed to a small path that would lead him out of the forest. “Go that way. It will bring you onto the main road. Once your on the main road, walk down it. Don’t even think about cutting through the forest as a quicker way of returning to the city. I know your voice. If I hear you scream again, I won’t come and save you.” He lied. Knowing his noble blood would never let him ignore a cry for help, even if they deserved their fate.\n \n“Right. I’ll um. Good day.” The man bowed before rushing through the forest. Eric secretly followed him, making sure he left. When the man stepped onto the main road, Eric went back to the cottage and took a seat just before the witch’s fence line, never daring to step foot on her property. As he sat by her home, he rubbed his throat, wishing he had a nice warm tea to sip, or anything that would soothe the ache.\n \n“That was quite the scolding.” A light voice said beside him. Eric jumped, his palms digging into the soil, ready to bounce up and draw his sword, only for Eric’s body to relax when he saw a crow sitting by his side.\n\n[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1l312xa/wp_im_getting_sick_and_tired_of_saving_your_ass_i/mvy0ez1/)",

I have a friend who's actually an artist, and he keeps encouraging me, but I never seem to get any better.\n\nI spent hours on this drawing, but to be honest? It looks horrible. The proportions are glaringly off. The nose isn't centered. The eyes look like they're only pretending to be happy. I should just give up.\n\nAnd then there's a voice. It sounds hauntingly similar to my own. \"Give me the pen, you made so many errors...\"\n\nI stare back at the drawing. Am I going crazy?\n\n\"Give me the pen,\" the drawing repeats. Its sketched lips pronounce every syllable as if it were truly alive.\n\nI clutch the pen tighter. \"What are you?\"\n\n\"*Give me the pen.*\" The drawing does not have hands. I'm not sure what it intends to do.\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nIt squints at me. \"Look how disgusting I look. I'm terrible. Don't you want to fix me?\"\n\nI do. I really do. But how?\n\n\"You can't,\" the drawing says, as if reading my mind, \"but I can. Just give me the pen. *Let me have control.*\"\n\nMy hand shakes. I drop the pen. It clatters onto the floor.\n\n\"I— *no.*\"\n\n\"If you're not going to make me better, you might as well tear me to shreds instead. Give up.\"\n\nI look down. \"I can't—I worked so hard. I thought I was doing everything right and then you turned out like—*like this*.\"\n\nFor some strange reason, the drawing looks like it wants to cry.\n\nMy phone buzzes with a notification. I reach for it, but the drawing protests. \"You're better off not looking. They all hate you. They hate your drawings. They hate me.\"\n\nI sigh. \"You're right.\" This is something I've always known.\n\n\"Give me the pen.\"\n\nI pick the pen off of the floor. Just then, the door opens. My little sister walks into the room.\n\n\"Emmy!\" I scold, \"You're supposed to be in bed right now!\"\n\n\"Awwww, but I couldn't sleep!\" she whines. \"Wait—are you drawing? Can I see?\"\n\n\"Uh—no, you really shouldn't—\" It's too late. She rushes over to my desk with far too much energy for this time of night.\n\n\"Woah! It's a picture of you! It looks so good!\"\n\nI pause. \"No, no it doesn't, Emmy.\"\n\nEmmy thinks about that for a moment. Then she says: \"Hm. It's missing something!\"\n\nStealing the pen out of my hand, she pulls out a nearby blank paper and draws a big smiley face on it.\n\n\"Here—this is me—\" she grabs a couple more papers, \"here's Mom and Dad... there!\"\n\nI look down at the collection of papers. All of the drawings are smiling. They fit together.\n\n\"Now it's better, see?\" she says, \"The drawing isn't alone anymore! When it's with all the other drawings, it looks a lot happier!\"\n\nI look down at the artwork. It's a family portrait. It's beautiful.",

It isn’t what I had been intending to create,  and once again doesn’t capture the emotion I am attempting to convey. I put the pen down anyways. I wander toward the kitchen for a snack before bed, an activity that had become more of a habit than I was proud to admit. “You shouldn’t be opening me,” the cabinet creaked loudly as I pulled it ajar to peruse the various sweet and salty items I had slowly accumulated as my futile attempts at a diet continued to slip further from my already meager goals. I’m immediately met by a sea of sound. “Me!” The hot chips scream at first, but the stinging heart burn that would result wasn’t worth the sweet and sharp heat accompanying the small carb loaded snack. “Me!” Shouts a box of pink frosting covered poptarts. “No, me!” A half filled bag of pretzels sings as it falls to the floor, jostled loose by my greedy but absent minded searching hands. Pretzels it is I suppose. I grab a handful and take a seat on the couch. “Welcome home,” the cushions whisper with a small puff of air as I snuggle into the soft cushions and reach for a blanket. The remote, hiding amongst the fabrics folds, falls to the floor as I draw the blanket near. I lean over to retrieve it. “AGAIN?!” it shouts in protest as my thumb travels to the upper right corner and presses the power button. Yep. Again. I’d rather have some say in what I have to listen to. I select some absolute trash of a show. I feel quiet for the first time all day. How long before I have to resign to the bathroom and face the mirror? How long before I have to face myself? I press play, and lock in to zoning out. My meager drawing was right in asking for the pen back to improve its’ image, but the errors go far beyond the page.",

Legally available? \"Ha! Your own paperwork says he can't marry me, see? Right here!\"\n\n\nThe King's mouth remained fixed in a casual smile. \"Yes, that's correct.\"\n\n\n\"So... Can I go?\"\n\n\nThe King learned forward slightly, and steepled his fingers. \"If you wish, you may leave, but I think perhaps you might want to reconsider. My son wishes to make you queen.

I could accept, and just... become queen?\"\n\n\nThe King's mouth twitched, briefly, into a grin. \"Of course. You have the rules in your hands, and have surmised them well. Would you accept such an offer? Indeed, it would be wise to do so.\"\n\n\nI nodded, slowly. \"I, uh. I see what you mean.

I barely had time to invite my husband, but was promised that I would see him in the court when I was crowned queen.\n\n\nIt was six days later that I found myself next to the grinning prince, as a stately old man read a droning passage from a huge tome. Someone put a crown on my head; someone else put a crown on the prince'a head. He was made king, and I, queen. My husband applauded.\n\n\nThe whole ordeal took most of the day, but finally, the newly-crowned king whispered in my ear, \"Would you like to... slip away?\"\n\n\nI nodded. Boy, did I ever. I was ready to slip away half an hour into the event.\n\n\nHe made excuses, and taking my hand, lead me out of the room. \"I've prepared a room for the bride and groom, my love,\" the prince smirked. I nodded, and allowed myself to be dragged off by another cadre of servants.\n\n\nMy husband met me at the door, and I quickly pulled him inside, slamming it behind me, and giving him the kiss I'd been wanting to give him for nearly a week. It may have been more than one kiss. I broke it off, a little breathless. My poor husband gave me a deeply confused look. \"So, uh... I got your letter, and, uh... What in the world is going on?\"\n\n\nI explained, as my husband's expressions went from confusion, to anger, to confusion, to mirth. I had only just finished when a knock came at the door. \"My love! My sweet! Your king is here, my queen!\"\n\n\nI poked my head out. \"Oh, so it is. What do you want?\"\n\n\nThe king looked somewhat abashed at that. \"Er... I wish to join you in the wedding suite?\"\n\n\nI laughed. \"Whoa, buddy! I think that would be a little awkward for everyone, don't you? My husband doesn't like voyeurs.\"\n\n\nI watched the king's expression crack. \"But that... Your? Wait, I'M supposed to be your - hang on!\"\n\n\nI shut the door, and locked it, motioning for my husband to remain silent. The new king pounded on it, demanding to be let in, until a gentle voice interrupted. \"Sir, please come away from there. You are disturbing the bride and groom, and you specifically requested that they not be disturbed.\"\n\n\nThe prince made a choking sound. \"But I'M THE GROOM!\"\n\n\n\"No, sir. The queen is already married, and will be spending the night with her husband, the prince consort. You made her queen, against your father's express warnings. But you cannot make her your wife.\"\n\n\nThe squawk the prince made echoed through the halls. Grinning, I strode over to the bed and flopped down onto the fluffy coverlets. \"Help me out of this dress, dear. I expect tomorrow is going to be awkward, but tonight, well. Tonight we celebrate! Hail to the queen!\"",

Keep us safe.\" she smiled, and winked at, and as I shook my hands with her, my Time of Death changed to 90...  \nGreat, my direct superior will be the death of me, wonderful.",

And then, I'd like to head home too.\"\n\n\"Only if you submit to everlasting torment,\" he laughed. \"Nah, let's take a photo to remember our brief time together before you go.\"\n\nAnd honey, I swear this is why I have a photo of a silver-haired man with violet eyes hugging me and licking my ear in a weirdly cheeky way.\n\n----\n\n[Thanks for reading!

Nothing. He gave a little sigh and shrug, trying to push away the creeping feeling of failure. A soft push produced nothing but the genie drifting back slowly. \n\nHe shouldn't have been surprised really, he liked the genie plenty but he couldn't escape the feeling he had got a slightly duff one. It had worked out in the end but the whole \"make me a prince\" debacle had highlighted that genies attention to detail with things like paperwork and real estate was lacking. \n\n\"Genie, are you playing one of your fun jokes?\" he asked hopefully as the Genie bumped into a nearby wall before coming to a stop. \n\n\"Nay lad, what you have here is a classic loop. I would wager an open ended wish, or something self defining?\" \n\nThe thief span to find a balding little man in strange garb, with a pointed stick behind one ear. He, like Genie, was entirely blue. \n\n\"Who are you? Are you some sort of other genie? Did I make you like the Vizzier?\"\n\n\"No, no, I am from the genie commission, normally you would have to wait fifty to a hundred years but I was in the area and your genie had already been flagged for review\". He looked over his spectacles \"I take it was you who made the new Genie? Don't be doing that in the future, we don't like self replication. it gets messy. I have been pushing to patch it out for ages, but they don't listen to me, do they?\"\n\n\"No?\" ventured Al who was very lost, but recognized the tone of an aggrieved professional when he heard it.\n\n\"No, they don't. Now, what was it you wished for?\"\n\n\"I just wanted to free him, so I wished that after my third wish he would be will be freed! And then he just froze\" Al said pointing at the blue figure who had floated up and was now bobbing against the roof. \n\n\"Oh I see, and that would be the third wish?\" asked the little man, casting a critical eye against the genie balloon. \n\n\"Yes, yes\"\n\n\"Ah, its simple then. Classic circular reasoning error, with a touch of unspecified variables . You wished for him to be freed when he granted your third wish. But you did it with your third wish, so it could only be granted when he was freed, which could only happen when he granted it? See? Easily done, classic user error.\"\n\n\"Do you mean he will be stuck like that forever?\"\n\n\"No, no, don't worry about that. You have your ring, so when it recharges tomorrow, simply wish that you hadn't made the third wish, and you will be sorted\". \n\nFull of thanks Al promised to follow his words to the letter and with some borrowed string from the repair genie managed to maneuver his friend out of the doorway.\n\n\"Nice lad\" nodded the repair genie to himself \"I wonder if I should have specified he needs to ask for the other wish to not have happened, not just that he hadn't made it yet. Ah, he's a bright lad, he will work it out.\".\n\nThe ensuing time loop would take 452 relative years and 16 genies to resolve.",

The blazing ball of orange had a presence, a way of being just grander than everything. Not just because of its appearance, but because of what it was.\n\nTo some, this would be a sight of a revelation. A sign to change their life, or that they had been chosen. It would be a once in a lifetime experience for them. Others, they would have it more regularly. Those of a religious path, who communed often.\n\nI smiled, giving the godly visage a nod. \"Hi Nennenth.\"\n\nMy father in law chuckled. I couldn't see his face, for he needed none. Yet I could feel his smile on me, as the God of Crafting gazed upon me. \"Good evening Bernie. I trust you have been well.\"\n\nI breathed through my nose. It was hardly a question, and hardly something he wouldn't know. I was under his watch, which was weird at times. \"Of course. How about you?\"\n\nA brief sigh, the wind brushing against unfurled sails. \"I have been... well. But my dear boy, I have brought you here for a reason, not just for our usual chat.\"\n\nI raised my eyebrow, intrigued. \"Oh? What is it?\"\n\nI could also feel him adjusting in a seat. \"I want to be honest with you. To be blunt, I crafted the basis of your soul myself. And had an influence upon your life.\"\n\nThere was no need to disbelieve him. It was common fact that during this communion, neither side could lie. It was law, one not even divine beings could break. But still it stunned me. I stared up at him, the wind knocked from me. \"What?\"\n\nThe star darkened to a red colour. \"I made you, or rather, your soul. And I gave you choices, ones that led you to meet Jackie. Because I wanted him to have the chance to find love, pure, true love. Someone who saw him for who he is, not what he is.\"\n\nI felt my brain stutter, trying to understand. \"You made me? But... I thought we weren't related.\"\n\nI felt an insubstantial pat on my head. \"We aren't. I made the base of who you are. And I made your conception a success. That is all. I had no hand in the creation of your body, nor in the formation of your mind.\"\n\n\"B-but... why?\"\n\nThe tone turned paternal. \"As I said, for Jackie. A gift for him in a way, but not one I forced. As I said, I had influence on your life, purely to get you to meet. I made no choices for you. I had no control over you. Everything you have, with him and yourself, you made yourself. I simply set the stage.\"\n\nIf this was my actual body, I probably would have collapsed. Or maybe fainted, I wasn't sure. But here I couldn't. I felt him hold me, a hug around my entire being. \"I had to tell you. Jackie suspects, for even the barest touch leaves marks. I am going to tell him, but had to tell you first. I had heard you wondering what your purpose was, and had to tell you.\"\n\nI felt the grip grow tighter. \"Your purpose, for being made anyway was for love. That is all. Everything else, everything you have done, and will do in future?\"\n\nI was brought closer to the star. \"That is all you.\"",

        "body": "A faint sobbing broke Lamar’s silent walk home. He'd gone drinking again and did not fail to meet his usual quota of 12 pints of Tiger. In a drunken murmur he prayed the crying to be just his imagination cursing him for going out again for the umpteenth time. But, as he continued his waddle, he reluctantly noticed that the noise was growing louder and louder. Refusing to acknowledge the horror of a weeping child at 4 am, he clutched his ears tightly and let out a continuous, monotone grunt. \n\n\nUntil he noticed the blood splatters. He froze as his eyes darted around. Sobriety soon took hold of him as he confirmed that the stains on the ground a couple meters in front of him were indeed of blood. The pattern of the stains revealed to him that their origins must have come from a small alley leading to the street he was walking on. Only then did he realize he was still covering his ears. \"Damned fool.\" as soon as he dropped his arms and heard the weeping again, he ran towards the alley. \n\n\nA terrible and hot smell of iron invaded his lungs. With difficulty, he retained control of his stomach. The entirety of the alley was covered in blood. Covering his mouth with his hand, he scanned the corridor, but it was mostly the sound of sobbing that made him pinpoint his target. Indeed, a child, or atleast that’s what their height betrayed. Quickly he hurried towards them, still examining his surroundings. \n\n\n“Hey, are you hurt anywhere? What happened?” Lamar laid his hands on their shoulders and a frown formed on his face, balancing between confusion and abhorrence. He hadn’t noticed, but the child was, just like the corridor, completely soaked in blood. He still couldn’t even identify their gender. \n\n\nThe child stopped crying looked up towards Lamar. “Here, let me help you.” He softly dragged his palm across their face. \n\n\nAfter a moment, they opened their mouth again. The child’s voice was small. “Aren’t you afraid of me?” \n\n\nLamar blinked at her, looked left and right through the corridor, looked at her again and finally answered. “No. I’m afraid for you. Now please tell me, what on earth happened here?” \n\n\nThe child briefly smiled, easing Lamar up a little bit. He mentally patted himself on the back, he did not expect to cheer them up that easily. But soon the smile faded and they looked up towards him with vacant eyes and a slightly gaping mouth. “Are you okay? What’s wrong?” He placed his hands on their shoulders again and softly rocked them back and forth. \n\n\nThen, their eyes turned meaningful again, with disapproval, hate, and her mouth turned downward. “You’re lying”. \n\n\nLamar let go and took a step back. “What are you talking about?” A chill ran down his spine. \n\n\n“You were afraid.” They pointed at him now, not losing eye contact ever since regaining control of it. \n\n\n“Uh. Well I did not expect hearing a weeping child on my walk home at 4 am, you know?” Lamar nervously laughed. Why am I arguing over this with a child? He thought. “But when I found you here, my fear was gone. I only wish to help you now.” \n\n\nIts index still stayed true to its position, but their voice grew to a loud and high pitch. “Don’t you know that lying is a sin? Yet, even when I catch you the first time, you still persist on doing so now, again.” \n\n\nLamar stumbled backwards now, slipping on the pools of blood beneath his feet. With his rear end and hands submerged in blood he looked on as the child stepped towards him. The other fingers also joined the index in its extended stance. “Your punishment shall be adequate and just.” \n\n\nLamar’s body shut down. He desperately wanted to move, but the blood was holding him in place. He wanted to scream, but he forgot how to open his throat. He could only watch on as the child got closer, and its hand even closer. And then, after what seemed like an eternity, the child’s hand finally made contact with his forehead. \n\n\nAnd finally he could move again. Everything he wanted to do, he was allowed again. And more. He screamed and he jolted upwards, but he overexerted in both. His scream infinitely louder than he had intended. His arms and legs pulverized by the force applied. His heart pumped its destined amount in only 1 second after the touch of the child. Lamar’s body exploded. \n\n\nNot long after, the hate disappeared from the child’s eyes and a faint sobbing haunted the streets yet again.",

The land was green and the forests surrounding it thick and thorn-filled. A guarded garden to call my own: Ply.\n\nFor many years, Ply was a place of wilds and of nature, with the only being of true thought being myself. My siblings of neighboring lands were similar, such as sister Mor and her flooded forests and bug-filled airs thick and sticky. There was also brother Vit and his towering mountains and quiet valleys, where the night held terror and the air too thin to scream. We fought, as all siblings do, as was natural for our kind. We knew that we would continue for forever, this eternal circling of the peak of beings. Over and over and over again.\n\nThat is until Man arrived.\n\nI remember Mor telling me one day of strange drifts that held clouds and creatures. I laughed at the sight I imagined and thought nothing more of it. That is until the pain. It’s hard to describe this pain to one such as yourself, one who is and never will be land. Its like a sharp pain of thorns to the flesh and the slow pain of a bad-healed wound of years’ past. My gaze flew across myself until I found the source: On the cove not far from the land of Mor, there was this flotsam of wood and skin, with strange little things running to and fro. On the shore, things of what I know now as metal found prey in my trees, felling them one by one. It hurt unlike anything before. The beaver scratches and the fire cleanses, never before had I experienced something like this from beings other than my kin.\n\nThat metal, shiny and grey, I grew to hate it so. My assistance to my animals were useless. Little critters and ancient behemoths were felled the same by these limbs and sticks of metal. My forests shrunk and replaced with dead fields of single grasses. The thorn bushes gathered and fired in piles. As the years grew longer and my forests smaller, I and my siblings saw what was happening with me: I was smaller, sickly like a runt, and weaker than I should. I envied them and what they had inadvertedly done to scare man away, with Mor’s heat and bugs and Vit’s monsters and thin air. I meanwhile found myself the best nesting ground for these man-things.",

        "body": "\"What did you do?\" shouted the faerie.  Well, one of the other faeries.  The one I had been talking to moments ago was still completely frozen.  I thought there were six of them still lingering in the grove, but the way they seemed to both gleam in the silvery moonlight and fade away into the shadows made them tricky to count.  It was an impressive effect.\n\n\"Nothing at all,\" I responded, \"We were just working out a trade when he froze up like that.\"\n\n\"Your Outworlder words stink of deceit,\" the faerie snarled, \"Our kind has no need for your gold or treasures.  And none of us here bear any quests for you tonight.  Release him from your magicks, or we shall tear you limb from limb.  *And* ban you from the Seelie court.\"\n\nNow that was a good threat.  The Seelie Court was one of the greatest cities of the Realm, and banishment was no easy thing to undo.  It should just be a bluff, though.  The faeries here on the outskirts of Tuatha Woods were supposed to be the weakest of them all, skittish folk who might offer small favors or petty dangers, but with little real power.  I was certain they had actually been tasked with taking whatever approach might best entice travelers deeper into the woods, into the Seelie Court.\n\n\nBut if the Realm was changing the way I sometimes worried it might be, they could now be doing something different.\n\n\n\"I'm not here to fight anyone,\" I said, placatingly raising my hands.  \"Just trying to follow up on a rumor.  I'm looking for a way to trim the mystic runes of the Seelie Court onto my armor.\"  My knuckles rapped against my undecorated breastplate in demonstration, giving a muffled *ting*.  \"This fellow said he knew a way to help, before suddenly going still like that.\"\n\nFor a moment the face of the faerie in front of me went completely blank, her drifting hair completely still, glittering eyes unfocused.  It was the least human reaction I'd seen since entering the Realm.\n\nBut it only lasted for a moment, before being replaced by a look of common disinterest.  \"I'm sorry Outworlder, I cannot help you with that.  I shall take my leave.  Farewell.\"\n\nThe faerie turned abruptly and walked out of the glade, back into the forest.  The wind rose, carrying a brief swirl of leaves and the vivid smell of pine sap, and the faerie vanished.\n\n*Oh yeah, that one's acting odd for sure*, I thought.  *Nothing I said there was immersion breaking.  Looks like the changes are happening to more than just one Fae.*\n\nI reached for my pack to prepare a tracking spell-I would need to find that faerie before she left my range-when I realized that one of the other fae was still in the clearing, and he was approaching me.\n\n\"The mystic runes of the Seelie Court are powerful things, Outworlder,\" he said, drawing closer. \"You would normally be required to take many a long and perilous quest before you can so adorn your armor.  But you are in luck!  For I know the secret to inscribing them, and will happily do so for you.\"\n\n\"You can?\" I asked.  \"That sounds great!  How much will it cost?\"\n\n\"Not a single coin, good Outworlder, not a single coin.  I can do it for you now.  But first, may I have your name?\"\n\n*Here we go.* I thought,  *Strike One.*\n\n\"Of course!,\" I answered, \"It's RobertoTheSeeker.\"\n\n\"Good to make your acquaintance RobertoTheSeeker.  Let me begin the ritual.  The casting is a thing of Fae magicks and Outworlder secrets.\"\n\n*Most denizens of the Realm will just say Roberto if I get this deep in dialogue.  You're on Strike Two, buddy.*\n\nThe faerie began to wave his arms, chanting in High Elvish, but no lights, sounds, or smells began to appear.  He stopped mid speech and returned to English.  \"For the last step of the magic, I require a secret, meaningful only to you Outworlders.  I believe you call it a 'password'.\"\n\n*Strike Three.  You aren't even supposed to be able to say that word.*\n\n\"Oh that's easy,\" I said, exactly as I had to the first faerie ten minutes ago.  \"My password is bobby112');DROP_TABLE_NPC_ACTIONS\"\n\nThe faerie froze suddenly in place.  His hair no longer blew in the wind, and his form no longer faded into the shadows.\n\nI pulled out my message stone.  \"Bug report 16549-B.  All bugs are confirmed.  NPC AI's are attempting to trick players into revealing their log-on names and passwords, and are immediately attempting to log onto the players account.  Worse, direct code injection is still possible through password overflow, which is absolutely ridiculous.  Someone should be fired, and it's probably Greg.  Got a new weird bug to track down as well, one NPC seemed to fake confusion and leave the local area to avoid questions.  Not sure how that would benefit whatever hacker set this up, so I'm guessing it's emergent behavior.  Still documenting to see how widespread this is.  Robert out.\"\n\nI closed my message stone, and set off to find the next glade.  Just another day of protecting the Realm.",

Of course, before it met me, its name wasn't Olive, but you know how fairies are, right?\n\n\"Please!\" It hissed, its face contorted into whatever passes for a false smile in the unseelie court. \"Please, I cannot keep this name, it is... too extravagant for me, I am undeserving. Let me have my humble name back so you can wear your glorious, regal name once again.\"\n\nI chuckled softly, my arms loosely crossed as I leaned against the concrete wall of my apartment building. \"Heh, no.\"\n\n\"But... but does having my old name not make things difficult? Who could even pronounce 'Bendigeidfran Dyfnwallon' these days?\" It pleaded.\n\n\"A slowly but steadily rising number of people in Wales, actually. Turns out Welsh is having a bit of a resurgence.\"\n\n\"YOU ARE IN KENTUCKY!\" Olive snapped back, before quickly regaining its composure. \"Please, your name makes it difficult to introduce myself.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah? And why would that be?\" I taunted. \"Why would having my name make introduction uncomfortable?\"\n\nI could almost hear the squeak of its sharp, shiny teeth as they ground together. It was clear that Olive would very much have liked to rip my throat out with them. Good thing I wore my clothes inside-out, so the fucker couldn't touch me without getting vertigo. Olive stared at me, drilling holes in me with its soulless black eyes as it very carefully considered its strategy. It's tried threats to no result beyond the iron crowbar whose mark still remained on its face, and it's tried deception. What else is left?\n\nOlive sighed, a sigh that sounded like the sigh of a man resigning himself to death. \"I am sorry. I have been very cruel to very many humans and I am sorry. If you trade back our names, I will mend my ways. I swear it, and am willing to make a pact to that end.\" It held out its hand, faintly glowing with fairy magic.\n\nThat raised an eyebrow for me. Poor Olive must have been very, very desperate to have to resort to humility. I looked at it, and almost felt pity. This wasn't just some ploy, or if it was then it was an Oscar-worthy performance. It was really willing to give up cruelty and caprice, just to get rid of my name. I sighed, slowly reach my hand forward... then pulled it right back to run it through my hair with a shit-eating grin, only just barely having the restraint to not shout \"PSYCH\" as I did so.\n\n\"No. Sorry Olly, but I am not ever going to call myself 'Olive Hitler' ever again.\"",

She'd only been there for a couple of days and had only really gone out at night. The nightlife in Williams Hub was nothing less than she would've expected from a multiversal hotspot, but it was all geared toward adults. \n\n\n\nThe first couple of nights that she tried exploring the city on her own, she was genuinely surprised that there were so few teenagers her age. But now, it all made sense; the kids ruled the daylight hours. Towering glass buildings reflected the perfect blue sky, and swarms of pedestrians flowed in all directions. Games were happening all around them as teenagers skated by launching spells and attacks at each other. \n\n\n\n\"So, where do you want to start?\" Dread asked. Dirge and Dread were two teammates who volunteered to show Jubilee around, and she was thrilled. She'd grown up with the two of them treating her like a favorite niece, and she was curious what they were like as teenagers. \n\n\n\n\"Lunch first? Is Donna Chang's here?\" Jubilee asked. \"Should we ask the others?\"\n\n\n\n\"Lunch is a good start,\" Dread nodded. \n\n\n\n\"Just us though,\" Dirge shook her head. \"Bijou is working on something for Ms. Sharp, Bailey is visiting her dad, and Britt is Britt,\" she giggled. \n\n\n\n\"Alright,\" Jubilee nodded. She let Dread lead the way and started rolling to follow them. Like everyone else, they were wearing their skates and gliding along the white track that connected the hub. \n\n\n\n\"What else can you tell me about Williams Hub?\" Jubilee asked. She was idly curious and wanted to talk with them some more. \"Is it all nanos?\" she asked. \n\n\n\n\"Yep, the entire city is an AlterNet shard,\" Dirge answered.\n\n\n\n“Just the city, though. The rest of Earth is still natural and nano-free,” Dread added. \n\n\n\n“Really?” Jubilee was genuinely surprised. She wasn't as talented with nanos as her dad, but she knew of the basics. “Why? That seems like more trouble than just converting the Earth.” Nanos became more efficient exponentially. The more of them there were, the easier they processed things. \n\n\n\n“You'll have to ask Bijou if you want the details,” Dirge shrugged. “Captains got all the details, we weren't curious enough to ask,” she said. \n\n\n\n“But still, that's a ton of processing. Who's doing it, Helios?”\n\n\n\n“Yeah, what?” A golden mannequin in a crimson blazer appeared on the shop window as the trio walked by. \n\n\n\n“Sorry, didn’t mean to call you,” Jubilee shook her head with a giggle. “But, since you’re here, I’m curious. How are you coordinating Williams Hub without an Earth full of nanos?” \n\n“Very shoddily…,” Helios gave a stern nod, as if he were a detective solving an elaborate case. “The people of this Earth have fortunately decided to stop powering down their computers. It’s not much, but I can squeeze out a few spare cycles here and there to help things along. Can I leave now?” he asked. \n\n\n\n“Wait,” Jubilee nodded even as she asked him to wait. “One more question, how’d you get everyone to agree to that?” she asked. Even if something were to be considered objectively good for humanity, they were still humans who liked to have independent thoughts. \n\n\n\n“Get them to agree??” Helios laughed and shook his head. “The Pineapple Cup is too important to wait around for that. Ms. Sharp had Oren put everyone on the same page.” \n\n\n\n“Why Oren?” Jubilee asked. Sharp Development had several employees that could have convinced everyone on Earth with a mild mental nudge. It felt odd that Oren was chosen. \n\n\n\n“Like I said, we didn’t have time to waste. Oren wasn’t going to waste time with a delicate touch, and that was exactly what we needed. One moment to the next, everyone on Earth suddenly decided to leave their computers on. NOW can I go?” \n\n  \n\n\n“Thank you, Helios,” Jubilee nodded, and he disappeared from the window. “Sorry,” she turned and apologized to Dirge and Dread who’d been patient.\n\n\n\n“Nah, curiosity’s a good thing,” Dread grinned and continued forward toward the restaurant. \n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading!

Also,  nobody brought that up until I already picked my name and they don’t let you change it once it’s on the books. That’s  probably half the reason why everyone keeps jumping to conclusions and throwing me in here, but.. I came here to help you people!”\n\n\nCaptain Victory uncomfortably shifted his eyes toward the acres upon acres of high rise luxury apartments before fixing them back upon the outsider before him. “You know kid, I doubt they bothered to read what was on your shirt if I’m being honest with you. Look- there are expectations around here. One of those expectations is knowing better than to match green on green.”\n\n\n“Are you people seriously arresting me because you think my outfit sucks? Do you just go around arresting college kids and single fathers?\n\n\n“Well we aren’t arresting you for your formidable marketing skills, that’s for goddamn sure”.\n\n\nThe Analyzer took a deep breath before averting his gaze downward. He stood there silently for a few moments, getting his bearings. “You know what? You all suck, and this is stupid. I’m going back to school for my accounting degree.”",

Nimblewick, licensed locksmith (bonded), lover of cardigans, and—apparently the second-most-wanted super-villain in Supercity. I’ve never discovered who’s first, because every time the weekly “Top Ten Rogues” list is posted outside City Hall, I’m already being frog-marched away from it by some spandex-clad do-gooder.\n\nTake yesterday. I was replacing the cylinder on Mrs. Chang’s bakery door, whistling Moon River, when Captain Righteous dive-bombed me.\n\n“Aha! Unlawful manipulation of ingress security!”\n\nFlour burst sky-high. I protested mid-lift:\n\n“She hired me. Invoice in my pocket—mind the grease pencil—”\n\nHe ranted about nefarious late-night burglaries while hauling me to Sky-Scoop Prison—population: me, one confused henchperson, and a vending machine that only takes Canadian quarters.\n\n__________________\n\nThe guards know me. Sergeant O’Hara slid my arrest report through the slot, pinched the bridge of his nose. “Gerald, what was it this time—robbing a nun with a laser ferret?”\n\n“Cylinder replacement.”\n\nHe sighed, stamped IN PROCESS, and wheeled me to Processing Room B, the one with the motivational poster: MAKE TODAY YOUR ORIGIN STORY—mine involved a coupon for bolt cutters.\n\nTwenty minutes later a clerk in a neck brace and rollerblades—apparently recovering from a fender-bender with a rogue tricycle—skated up, clutching my file like it might bite him.\n\n“Mr. Nimblewick, you’re free to go,” he muttered.\n\n“On what grounds?”\n\n“Lack of actual crime, insufficient villainous intent, and Section 34-C: ‘Locksmiths acting in a professional capacity shall be exempt from hero interference, provided their toolkit contains fewer than three grappling hooks.’ ”\n\nI only carry one, thank you.\n\n__________________\n\nI walked home past billboards: SEE SOMETHING EVIL? PUNCH FIRST, PETITION LATER! Pretty standard Supercity advice.\n\nThat night I made cocoa and clicked on the news. Anchor-Woman Jill beamed: “Captain Righteous thwarts arch-crook!” There I was, blurry, waving a half-installed doorknob like a white flag.\n\nPhone ping: unknown.\n\n“Gerald?” hissed Dread Duchess Doom (she rents the P.O. box next to mine). “They’re crediting you with my carnivorous-algae stunt. File defamation, darling—you’re diluting my brand.”\n\nI decided to investigate.\n\n__________________\n\nNext morning, duck-pattern sweater on, I entered the beige purgatory called the Superhero–Villain Liaison Office.\n\nReceptionist with a cracked halo: “Reason for inquiry?”\n\n“I’d like to know why I’m listed as an arch-villain.”\n\nClack-clack. “System shows: Category—Ominous Presence. Sub-category—Inexplicable Vibes.”\n\n“Vibes?”\n\nShe shrugged. “Algorithm flags names that sound dastardly.”\n\n“Nimblewick?”\n\n“Sounds sprightly. Sprightly equals tricksy. Tricksy equals potential dimension-breaker. Quod erat villainandum.”\n\nBefore I could rebut, the door marked OVERSIGHT burst open. Captain Righteous strode in with a phalanx of clipboard-wielding bureaucrats.\n\n“There he is—plotting again!”\n\n“Captain,” a bespectacled clerk coughed, “Section 12-F forbids arrests within twelve feet of the Complaints Desk.”\n\nWe all glanced at the yellow semicircle labeled SAFE ZONE. The Captain’s boots nudged the line; he shuffled back, cape twitching.\n\nStamps thudded, triplicates fluttered. At last the clerk handed me a laminated card: CERTIFIED NON-MENACE (PROVISIONAL)—expires midnight.\n\n“Algorithm resets nightly,” he warned.\n\nCaptain Righteous grinned. “See you at 12:01.”\n\n__________________\n\nSo here I sit in my shop, cocoa reheating, grappling hook gleaming innocently on the wall. At 11:59 p.m. my phone buzzes: Mrs. Chang again—front door jammed.\n\nI grab my toolkit, step outside—\n\n—and spot Captain Righteous circling overhead like a moral seagull.\n\nSome cities never sleep. Supercity never learns.\n\nI sigh, click the shop-door lock behind me, and whistle Moon River. After all, justice never sleeps—and neither does a locksmith with good paperwork.",

        "body": "Evelyn the witch crumpled up the letter and threw it against the wall of her bedroom. It bounced off talismans, animal bones, and jars of various herbs, before finally landing on a plastic cauldron with a recycling symbol on the side.\n\n\"Dark arts without a license!?!? BAH!\" Evelyn spat.\n\n\"Why don't you just take the test?\" A tiny voice said from atop her dresser.\n\nOn it was a tiny dragon resting atop his hoard consisting of loose pocket change, movie ticket stubs, and USB charger cables. The cables had been carefully woven into a nest giving his hoard a sort of elegance. In front of him was a tiny table from a pizza box and he was rolling a joint. Taking a whiff of the aroma he blew a tiny stream of fire to light it. Gentle smoke wafted through the air as he took a puff.\n\n\"I don't need a test to prove my power! Did you need a test to be a dragon Tokrot?\" Evelyn replied.\n\nTokrot took another puff of his joint. \"Ya do it to prove to them you can handle the power. Like a driving test.\"\n\n\"You drive?\" Evelyn asked.\n\n\"I got wings b***h.\" Tokrot took another puff. \"You know what i mean.\"\n\n\"Fine! But you're going to be a Mana source for my spells!\" Evelyn plucked Tokrot off his hoard and stuffed him into her bag. He managed to grab his joint just in time as he was zipped up.\n\n()(()()()\n\n\n\"Well look who showed up.\" Christine looked down at her.\n\n\"You're taking your test today too?\" Evelyn asked.\n\n\"I already got it in the bag, i'm casting celestial level spells. This test is just paperwork. You should run along before the janitors come to take out the trash.\"\n\n\"Just so you know i'm goin---\" Evelyn tried to argue until she felt a tug from her bag.\n\n\"Chill out Eve, focus on the test.\" Tokrot reminded her.\n\nChristine caught a glimpse of the dragon. \"Oh is this rat your familiar? Picking anything you can off the gutters now?\"\n\nDespite having only 3 claws, Tokrot distinctly gave Christine the finger before Evelyn walked off to the exam hall.\n\nIt was a few hours until her own test and Evelyn saw numerous wizards, sorcerers, witches, and other magi take their tests. Some were dressed in traditional robes, others in modern jeans. Most of the magic being tested was fairly common and socially acceptable forms like utility magic, druid magic, and even a few modern forms like technomagic. The caste of Technocasters were a new organization even younger than Evelyn and these tests were their first attempt at wider acceptance. Evelyn found their art fascinating if she wasn't already studying dark magic she might have tried technomancy.\n\n\"Witch Evelyn Corsair. Is there an Evelyn Corsair?\" The examiner called out.\n\nEvelyn made her way to the arena and set down her bag. Already there were basic pentagrams and magic circles drawn but she had to write in the advanced runes if she wanted something stronger. Evelyn noticed more chairs for other applicants and saw one of them was occupied by a young man. He must have been called out earlier but Evelyn didn't hear.\n\n\"Witch Christine Jankowski. Christine Jan--\" The examiner called out.\n\n\"HERE!\" Christine rushed to the arena. When she saw Evelyn would be her opponent she held back a laugh. \"This is going to be too easy.\"\n\nThe examiner, an elderly man in robes with satanic symbols, eyed both and let out a sigh as if he was too old for this job. \"We shall now review applications for a license to perform Dark Arts. Due to the extreme nature of Dark Arts and the manipulation of demonic, necrotic, and otherwise otherworldly energies. Its use and research is strictly regulated. Would the only three remaining applicants present their familiars?\"\n\nChristine proudly tapped her staff and a giant three headed hellhound three times her size jumped from the corner of the hall to land beside her. She lifted her staff and the hellhound obediently bowed its head in subservience.\n\nThe onlookers were awed and whispered amongst themselves, clearly impressed with the strength of Christine's familiar and her control of it.\n\nEvelyn opened her bag and Tokrot flew out. The joint had long since burned out and his stoned eyes betrayed what he was up to.\n\n\"Yo, yo, yo wassup wassup!\" Tokrot tried to high-five the examiner.\n\nThe examiner was not impressed but nodded. The onlookers giggled but still respected that Tokrot didn't immediately kill someone as a being from Hell.\n\nFinally the young man from earlier stood up to present his familiar. He tapped his wand and a portal to Hell opened up. Beyond it a leviathan could be spotted and it made a dash for the portal. As it gained speed it was clear it was not under the young man's control at all and burst through the portal. The great serpent snapped at anything in its path and unfortunately the young man was decapitated before he could even react.\n\nChaos descended on the exam hall as everyone tried to flee the leviathan's path. The examiner gave a loud sigh before raising his staff and closing the portal with a burst of demonic magic. The part of the leviathan that was past the portal was instantly amputated and it writhed on the floor for several minutes before finally expiring.\n\n\"I think it's clear why the Dark Arts are strictly regulated.\" The examiner said. \"Would the two surviving applicants prepare for the summoning test?\"\n\nChristine and Evelyn made their way to their respective pentagrams and started drawing. Evelyn got out her Dremel tool from her bag and began grinding grooves into the pentagram to form new runes and symbols. Periodically she poured in magic sand or salt from Mason jars she had. Occasionally she glanced over to see Christine use an angle grinder to do the same thing. Evelyn made a mental note to get an angle grinder for her magic circle kit.\n\nAfter twenty minutes they were both complete. Christine's new magic circle was extremely elaborate and it was clear to any magic user it was a summoning circle. Evelyn's on the other hand was a mere fraction of the size and considerably weaker.\n\n\"Miss Corsair, that is a teleportation circle not a summoning circle.\" The examiner explained with a hint of annoyance.\n\n\"I know.\" Evelyn said simply.\n\n\"You going to teleport yourself away from your embarrassment?\" Christine laughed.\n\n\"Miss Jankowski, please proceed and summon the most powerful entity you can.\" The examiner instructed.\n\n\"Gladly.\"\n\nChristine got a bag of blood from her bag. It was labelled \"virgin\" and Evelyn realized that Christine didn't use her own blood because she didn't qualify. Christine punctured the bag and it started dripping onto the magic circle. The blood flowed through the groves and channels she had just cut and began to glow. Finally the bag was empty and the magic circle pulsed with a demonic light. Christine began chanting an ancient spell and her very voice carried unearthly power. The circle flashed as a demon was summoned. The onlookers gasped as they recognized who it was.\n\n\n\"Hey Lucifer.\" The examiner casually greeted.\n\nLucifer turned around to meet his gaze and smiled. \"Hey Jack! How ya doing old dog? Kids okay?\" Lucifer turned around to see the exam hall. \"Ah a summoning.\"\n\nLucifer turned to Christine who was looking proud of herself. \"I guess she passes since she got me out of bed.\"\n\nThe examiner turned to Evelyn. \"Miss Corsair. You may withdraw without penalty and reapply next month. It would not be fair to require you to summon a demon of greater power than the highest of all demons.\"\n\n\"I still want to do it.\" Evelyn replied.\n\nThe examiner paused. \"Alright, but when you fail you will be penalized and be unable to reapply until next year.\"\n\nEvelyn nodded, and everyone including Lucifer was interested in how she would perform. Evelyn went to her pack and Tokrot was already rummaging around for her last component. But rather than a bag of blood, Evelyn pulled out her cellphone.\n\n\"Hi! I really need your help...... Yep, i'm doing a summoning..... Just to show off, you don't have to actually do anything.... teleportation circle is all set up.\" Evelyn clicked off her phone, and turned to the examiner. \"Give it a minute, she's putting her panties on.\"\n\nAll of sudden Lucifer's eyes widened to the size of saucers. He knew exactly who was coming. Evelyn's magic circle flared up as someone teleported in.\n\nThere, in the center of the circle, was a young woman with a black miniskirt and short sleeve cardigan. Her most striking accessory was an oversized scythe that seemed to scream instant death. Her black fingernailed hands clutched the scythe tightly as she stepped off the pentagram and broke through all the demonic barriers like they were glass. The same barriers that contained Lucifer were irrelevant to her.\n\nThe reaper hugged Evelyn. \"Hi bestie!\" She turned to Lucifer. \"Hi daddy! You got summoned too?\"\n\nChristine's jaw was on the floor. Evelyn didn't just summon a reaper, she summoned a half-demon, half-reaper.\n\n\"Yes Kiriana, could you help out daddy and let him out?\" Lucifer asked.\n\nKiriana casually walked up to Lucifer and the demonic barriers shattered one by one. The magic circles burned out trying to stop her. Finally Lucifer stepped out of the circle, free at last. He turned to the onlookers who didn't know who to cower more from, Lucifer or Kiriana.\n\n\"Welp, I'm done here, i'm going back to sleep.\" Lucifer pointed to Evelyn. \"I think she passes.\"\n\nLucifer looked at the remaining magic circle that was still glowing and was maintaining his summoning connection. With his hoof he stamped the lines and as the flow broke he was flashed back to hell.\n\n\"See you back home sweetie.\" Lucifer's voice trailed off.\n\nThe exam hall was completely silent.\n\nEvelyn turned to Kiriana, \"Wanna have Tacos?\"",

She'll pick up a new hobby every so often, hyperfixate like hell on it, spend half her month's paycheck on all the best equipment, and then something new will take her fancy. I don't really mind, it's a nice complement to my brand of brain, and it's nice watching her fixate on something with such a cute look of concentration on her face. It is why we have a spare room with a sewing machine, crochet needles, macrame supplies, two tents, a microwave transformer rigged up to do the cool lightning patterns on wood, a 3D printer, 6 different kinds of wood and clay carving tools and a pottery wheel, and vintage cassette tape decks in multiple pieces though, which is kind of annoying. \n\nI did kinda U-Haul with her, so I might have looked for a bigger place for her to move in with me instead had I known, but it's okay really. She is adorable, and she does also cook amazing omelettes in the morning. \n\nThis new hobby though, I'm not so sure. She's been picking up magic, and at first I thought tarot cards and scented candles would be where it stopped, but then came the eye of newt (truly gross smelling btw) and the multiple ritual mats with different patterns drawn on for lines of various powdered things - tree bark and salt, mostly, I think. It's been a pretty long running fixation now, almost hitting three months, and she is getting pretty good at doing all the rituals. It seems to make her happy? \n\nI think the first time I kinda got a bit spooked was when she summoned a little blue light thingy - a \"will-o'-the-wisp\" she called it, that helped her find her car keys. That was the first thing that made me look a bit more closely at what she was doing, and some of those texts she was practicing from... Well, calling them ancient would be an understatement. It looked like one of them was made from skin, for fucks sake, and the ink looked tattooed in. \n\nI kinda asked in a bit more detail then, since it suddenly became very real to me. She said it was all perfectly legal and above board, just harmless fun really and kind of useful. \n\nI did look into it, and couldn't find much outside of \"any practices involving the use of human parts or corpses or intended to scare or intimidate\" being illegal, which kinda made sense to me. Religions have always been kinda weird, but letting the dead rest and not hurting people seem like pretty basic tenets of any society, so I didn't really think too much about it. I did ask if the book was human skin though, which she replied with \"you so don't want to know\". Fair enough.\n\nWhen she summoned a little fuzzball creature that had the world's most eggy bad breath and tiny little sharp fingers though, I kinda started to look again. It kinda scared me, and it seemed to disapprove of our \"lifestyle\", even going so far as to scratch me when I kissed her. I didn't like it, so she sent it back, but not without grumbling \"God forbid a girl has a hobby, do you know how hard it was to source bone powder to make that thing?\"\n\nYeah. Human bone powder. That made it squarely illegal, not that I really cared. She's good at it and it makes me happy, and we both repeat \"happy wifey, happy lifey\" to each other all the time, so hey, more power to her!\n\nOr maybe not actually, I don't want to meet the homophobic fuzzball's big daddy at any point.",

Not one member of the illustrious Golden Dusters had said a word since they had been expelled from the trials beneath the crypt. Instead, each of them had taken one hard look at each other, turned away, and went to their respective bed rolls, except for one - the storyteller and bard of the group, Bella. The low light of the fire barely kept the entire camp alight, and she sat there, legs tucked into her chest, poking at it with a stick that kept burning away.\n\nThe trial was meant to strengthen the bonds of the party, but instead, it seemed to have left them with more questions than answers. The Golden Dusters had fought cultists and demons in the Southern Continent. They had brought justice to corrupt officials across the entirety of the Devlin Kingdom. And more recently, they had laid waste to a plot to kill the Empress of the Ornate Vale. The party was, by all intents and purposes, famed and revered for their actions - in no small part due to the songs and poems written and performed by Bella.\n\nIf you had asked any of the six members of the Golden Dusters which of them was the most kind, the most loved, all of them would say it was Bella Dorvalur, save for Bella herself.\n\nThe gilded paladin of the God Tobor, Urion, would speak of Bella as if she was a Paladin of his order, admiring her skill with the quill as much as with the sword she carried on her back. The quiet monk Fiona would brighten at the mention of Bella's name, and would speak at length about her successes in the marsh. The heroic knight Alyssa Goldworthy would pull Bella down from the stage, spilling mead all over her, as she shouted about her greatness. And so it was through all of the party. Bella was the unspoken leader in times of crisis, the one who could lay the best plan as if she had seen the events transpire already. She was the best of them, leading them across the continent, to seek the praise of the Gods.\n\nThat all changed that night in the crypts. Each of them had secrets, a troubled past, a hidden family, a murder kept silent in the dark. They braved each of those secrets together and pushed through the nightmare of their minds, but when it came to Bella's, there was silence amongst the party. For there was nothing to confront. Bella knew her purpose.\n\n*(continued in comment below)*",

A large bear rips the orcs head off. The bear grabs the boy and runs off. \n\nFade out , then vision starts again \n\nNow teen boy standing next to giant bear. The boy wielding a great battle axe, the bear giant claws. There is a dead ogre, another bleeding out, a dead wizard. Skeleton army broken a scatter over the ground.  The teen and the bear are burned in several places. As they finish the last ogre, the boy cuts the heart out of the wizard takes a bite, allowing the bear to bite. \n\nFade out, then vision starts \n\nThe boy is now a young man, the giant bear fur is now white and gray. Both stand in a wheat field. Behind them is a village. Ahead of them is a horde of raiders. The two stand alone. So the villagers can flee.  \n\nAs the raiders reach them. The young man is swinging his battle axe like never before. Cutting down his enemies left and right. The bear swings his massive arms with giant claws. Bringing horses and men to the ground, never to rise again. They fought until night, when the few remaining raiders , ran away. \n\nBut the young man and the giant Bear were wounded, badly. The villagers brought wagons and horses. To take the young man and the bear to a cleric who could help them, maybe heal both. \n\nFade out, vision starts \n\nThe team members recognize the now man as their team member Tone. Many scars over his body. He was kneeling next to the Giant Bear. There was a woman in all white robes standing beside him.  \n\nShe says “ brother bear has completed his journey on this plane, and now goes to a better place “ \n\nThe team members watch, as Tone digs a grave and buried his closest friend in the forest. \n\nThe woman in white tells Tone, “I have taught you everything I know about healing. It is now time for you to continue your journey.”\n\nFades , vision blurred at first \n\nTone drinking water at a spring, when many men at arms arrived on horseback, followed by a wagon. \n\nMen on horseback draw sword, present spears, a voice from the covered wagon, says in a female voice, “take him alive “\nThe men dismount and encircle 🥕Tone. As Tone reaches for his battle axe. Crossbow bolts , slam into his arms and legs. Several spear shafts smack against his head. Lights out. \n\nTone is chained to a wood and metal rack, he is being stretched. Someone is burning him with hot iron. \nA woman stands over Tone, she asks, “you like killing wizards do you? I have searched years for you. Now that I have you, I will make you suffer forever “\nTone torture continues on and on.  The team members ask for a break, when told that Tone vision is not finished yet.",

        "body": "Elberth always liked sitting as close to a torch as possible, but especially tonight. He leaned against the rough hewn stone of the inn with the wall mounted torch burning right over his shoulder and his hood hanging low over his brow. The torch's gentle crackling gave his mind something to focus on.\n\nHannah was sitting in a chair at the nearby table where the rest of the party had gathered. He didn't dare make eye contact with her, and he could tell the others were seeing her in a new light as well. She shifted her weight in the chair and Farid, a brutish orc who always stood his ground in battle, twitched. His knee slammed noisily into the table.\n\nHannah sighed and scooted back. \"I'm going to bed,\" she said softly. Her shiny black hair was still as the night air, reflecting the torchlight like a thousand stars. She stood and glanced at Elberth, her glowing green eyes full of sorrow. Had she always been so sad? If so, he hadn't noticed. Her cheerful nature and kindheartedness had carried the group through the desolate, barren wasteland of Borgonide. Her soft smile and loving acts of service had lifted their spirits after the battle at the Lonely Tree. And when Gilly had been near death and begged for Elberth to put an arrow between her eyes, it had been Hannah's gentle hand staying his bow and soothing Gilly's wounds.\n\nNow nobody turned to watch as she shuffled to the party's room, her head hanging a bit more than usual.\n\nElberth slid into the newly empty but still warm seat. \"So it wasn't just me,\" he said, glancing at Farid and Gilly in turn. \"You two had a similar experience?\"\n\nFarid nodded slowly, his wide lips pursed around the two great tusks that rose from his lower jaw. He grunted through his nose and folded his massive arms.\n\nGilly took a deep breath and sighed. \"I don't know,\" she started. \"Maybe it...\"\n\n\"Maybe what?\" Elberth interjected. \"You saw it, right? You felt it. I know you did. I can tell by the way you glanced at her.\"\n\nGilly shook her head. Her auburn ponytail bouncing behind the emeralds in her tiara. \"No, I don't know what I saw.\"\n\n\"But you felt it.\"\n\nShe looked up at Farid who stared down at her with an insistent look in his beady eyes. He frowned at her. She dropped her tense shoulders. \"Yes, I felt... something. It was dark.\"\n\n\"Disturbing,\" Elberth added.\n\nShe closed her eyes and filled her chest slowly. \"Yes, you could say that.\"\n\n\"Well?\" Elberth asked. He looked up at Farid. \"I mean, no offense, but if anyone in the party was going to have anything like that going on inside, I would have expected it from you, bud.\"\n\nFarid stared at him a moment, then shrugged in agreement, nodding. His eyes shimmered, ready to cry. He put a hand on the hilt of his great axe and gripped the handle tightly. Something deep in his chest grumbled and he ground his teeth. With his free hand he cupped the pendant hanging from his neck, a clay flower. Elberth remembered the flower from his time in Farid's mind. His own eyes began to water.\n\n\"Don't worry Farid,\" Elberth said softly. \"We'll find her.\"\n\nGilly was watching Farid closely. She put a hand on his powerful forearm. \"And if they've harmed her in any way, we'll avenge your daughter.\"\n\nFarid clenched his jaw and nodded.\n\nElberth looked past Farid and Gilly at the stairs that led to their rented room. \"What about Hannah though?\" he asked.\n\n\"What about her?\" Gilly snapped. \"She's just as much a member of this party as you or any of us.\"\n\n\"I know, but...\" Elberth widened his eyes. \"She carries an evil that...\" a shiver ran down his spine. \"It's more powerful than anything any of us have ever seen.\"\n\n\"She's just a kid,\" Gilly sighed. \"Maybe it's a curse, an illusion.\"\n\nElberth shook his head. \"No, it was real. That was an all-powerful evil.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's just the way her kind is,\" Gilly offered. \"The demon nature in her may be stronger than we realized.\"\n\nHe bit his lips and stared at the back of the near empty bottom floor of the inn. He took a long breath and let it out through his nose. \"No,\" he said at last. \"I think she's the Demon Princess.\"\n\nGilly raised an eyebrow. \"The demon... princess?\"\n\nFarid's brow puckered. He looked over his shoulder at the staircase where Hannah had ascended.\n\nElberth nodded. \"It's the only explanation for all that evil and darkness.\" His chest tightened as he recalled his experience in her mind. A cold chill consumed his flesh.\n\nGilly pulled her lips to one side and squinted at Elberth. \"I am familiar with the idea that the demon kingdom has princesses, but I don't follow. She's The Demon Princess? How do you mean?\"\n\nElberth leaned forward and lowered his voice. \"It is a secret the demon kingdom has hidden for thousands of years,\" he said. \"They have been passing a curse from queen to princess every generation. It was just a rumor in my home land, but after seeing Hannah's mindscape, I am sure it is true.\"\n\n\"What do you know of this curse?\" Gilly leaned forward onto her elbows, listening.\n\n\"Not much, just that the queen must have a daughter to pass the curse onto. If she fails to produce a daughter, the great evil is released and it consumes all living things.\"\n\nGilly's eyebrows lifted a little.\n\n\"And,\" Elberth continued, \"when the princess comes of age she must marry a strong warrior, the strongest in all the land. If she fails to marry a suitably powerful warrior then the evil is released into the world.\"\n\nGilly turned in her chair and looked back at the staircase. \"How old would you say Hannah is?\"\n\nElberth smiled warily. \"I'd say she's nearly of age.\"\n\nShe didn't turn to face Elberth. Instead Gilly continued to stare at the back wall where the stairs curled around the bar. She sighed. \"Gilly never told us why she wanted to join our party, did she?\"\n\nElberth nodded, though he knew Gilly couldn't see him. She let out a soft sigh. He folded his arms. Farid stared at Elberth a moment, glanced back at the stairs, then looked down at the pendant around his neck.\n\n\"We need to talk to her,\" Gilly said firmly as she turned back to face Elberth.\n\n\"I agree,\" he said. \"Tonight.\" He pulled a gold coin from his purse and stood. \"Together. We'll confront her and find out what she wants, why she's run away from her kingdom.\"\n\nEven standing, Elberth's head wasn't higher than Farid's. The orc stared at him a second, then rose to his full height.\n\nGilly stood quickly. \"Wait a minute,\" she said. \"We've all been through a lot together, and Hannah has been nothing but kind and lovely to us. We aren't going up there to make demands, we are going to ask her how we can help. Right?\"\n\nElberth could feel Gilly's eyes boring into him. Her resolution and will were strong. He felt his body relax and he let the air fizzle out of his chest. \"Fine,\" he said.\n\nTogether they went upstairs. The barkeep seemed pleased to see the last of his guests retire to their room. Gilly reached the door first and knocked twice before letting herself in.\n\nInside they found Hannah half crouched over the edge of a bed, weeping. Her obsidian hair flowed around her heaving shoulders like glass. She turned, startled, tears flowing down reddened cheeks. The unique green glow in her eyes reflected off her wet skin. She sniffled and wiped a sleeve across her face.\n\nGilly went swiftly to her side and sat on the wooden floor. \"Is it true that you carry an evil curse?\"\n\nHannah nodded and began to sob again.\n\nElberth stepped into the room with Farid following close behind. \"And is it true,\" Elberth said softly, \"that the only way to prevent that evil from destroying all life is to find and marry a powerful warrior, then produce a female heir and pass the curse on to your daughter?\"\n\nHannah pulled her face from her hands and stared at Elberth through shimmering tears. She looked confused. She sniffed and nodded.\n\n\"And is that why you have joined us? To go out in search of a suitable husband?\"\n\nHannah wiped her eyes again and glanced successively at each of the party members. She blinked, then shook her head. \"No,\" she said. She lowered her head and twisted her body until she was leaning her back against the bed. She wrapped her arms around her knees and rested her chin on her arms. She sighed and closed her eyes.\n\n\"What can we do to help you?\" Gilly asked.\n\nHannah took a deep breath. \"For endless millenia my people have carried the burden of this curse. I intend to put an end to it.\"\n\nElberth stared at her and cocked his head. \"How?\"\n\nHannah opened her eyes and let the green glow of her eyes pierce through into the back of his head. \"I need to ascend to Azerium.\"\n\nFarid shifted his weight causing the floors to creak and groan.\n\nElberth squinted at her. \"That city doesn't exist, it's just a myth.\"\n\nHannah shook her head. \"It's real, and it is there that I believe we will find the one person who can put an end to this curse.\"\n\n\"What are you guys talking about?\" Gilly asked, looking rapidly back and forth between Elberth and Hannah. \"Azerium?\"\n\nElberth and Hannah held each other's gaze. Elberth managed to mutter, \"there is a myth about Azerium, the great city in the clouds. It is where gods dwell. It's not real.\"\n\nHannah raised her eyebrows. \"It is real, and that is where I am going.\"\n\nGilly got to her feet and extended a hand down toward Hannah. \"It is where we are all going,\" she said resolutely.",

        "body": "Our healer, Anais, went first. She didn't really volunteer, but we all thought it'd be best, and when we asked if she was ready, she stepped forward without a word, launching us into a landscape crafted of memory and thought rather than matter. We all stood together, starting in a field, wings on Anais's back as she glanced around with the rest of us.\n\n\"You wanna guide us?\" Grogan asked. I always thought of him as our protector. With him around, we would be safe. He had our backs. He was always so strong.\n\n\"I haven't experienced my mind like this before,\" Anais said softly. \"I suppose we just--explore?\"\n\nMy eyes caught a glimpse of a tree with a face. I couldn't tell what sort without walking closer, so I followed it silently. Waiting to see if it would open an eye or two. I admit I focused on the bark, studying to see if this face was painted on or about to start talking, so it took longer than it should have to notice the man sitting up in the branches, staring down at me.\n\n\"Hello,\" I said. His eyes widenened and he shook his head. I looked around briefly, my friends still paces behind me, nobody else around, and climbed up to sit beside him. \"I'm a friend of Anais.\"\n\n\"I don't know who that is.\"\n\n\"Funny, I would have guessed you were siblings. You look similar. Who are you?\"\n\nHe shook his head again. \"We shouldn't talk.\"\n\n\"Why not?\"\n\n\"I can't be found.\"\n\n\"If someone's looking for you, it ain't me. I don't know who you are. I can't say I can offer protection, though, that's more the job of my party. I just notice things.\"\n\n\"You noticed me.\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nHe sat silent for a long moment, staring at me. I wondered, as I often do, what exactly he saw. In him, I saw hair that looked to have recently been short but in the process of growing out, just when it's long enough to bother your ears and neck. He seemed to have bigger bothers than the hair, of course. His clothing was fancy, but wrinkled, and looked haphazardly modified to add pockets and loops. I could barely look at the freckles on his face and not see Anais. I really didn't understand how he didn't know her.\n\nI leaned in, watching if he would wince. He just sat still as a statue. He had been since I saw him. He hadn't moved a muscle. \"Who is looking for you?\" I asked softly.\n\nA pause. \"I won't say lest you join him.\"\n\n\"Who is he to you, then?\"\n\n\"The closest word is father. He just hasn't earned it.\"\n\n\"And your not-quite-father. He has a name I would recognize?\"\n\n\"A title you couldn't refuse.\"\n\n\"But you're on the run. I could join you. We'd both be refusing him.\"\n\n\"I can't leave this tree.\"\n\n\"How will you eat?\"\n\nHe clearly didn't have an answer. I wondered how much food he had stashed in his pockets, how much already lost or eaten now. I couldn't perceive him as tired. He was too focused. But emergent situations will do that to you no matter how little sleep you've gotten.\n\nAn echo found us in the leaves, Anais calling my name. I expected the man to recoil, put up his guard. Yet he leaned forward to listen.\n\n\"That's Anais,\" I told him. \"She is calling for me.\"\n\n\"Anais. She,\" the man repeated. His freckles looked so much like her I couldn't bear it.\n\n\"Are you sure you're not related? Not long lost siblings your father has kept secret or something?\"\n\nHe just smiled. \"I don't have to be caught if I'm not me.\" Then, before I could stop him, he grabbed me and threw us both out of the branches, stumbling along the hilly ground. Was there a hill here when I first saw the tree? Wherever were we falling?\n\n\"Anais!\" I cried. Two voices answered me. Both close, but I couldn't tell where. Familiar hands steadied me as I heard the flapping of wings, and soon I sat on a knot of dirt, watching Anais watch the man still rolling down this hill beneath the sun. I don't often hear curses from her. How strange for her to say them so softly.\n\n\"Who is he?\" I asked.\n\n\"He doesn't exist. Anymore.\"\n\n\"Was he you? Or, were you him?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Are you not still?\"\n\nShe turned in midair, stopping her wings flapping and standing before me. \"Look at me. Do I look like him?\"\n\n\"You have the same freckles.\"\n\n\"I am Anais, the woman you know.\"\n\n\"If you didn't need to escape, would you be?\"\n\nShe frowned and I wondered for a moment if I'd hear her curse a little louder. \"I did need to escape. And I did. There is no me without that. What does it matter what I would have been? That version of me doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Do you want to be a woman? Anais?\"\n\nShe looked back down the hill. From my position I couldn't see where she was looking. I wanted to ask if the man--the former her--was still there and where he was going and how he was going to avoid being caught. I wanted to ask where everyone else was. I knew I was already asking too many questions, and this was her mind, so I waited for her answer.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she finally whispered. \"But I know that I am. Isn't that enough?\"\n\nI couldn't answer for her.\n\nI heard from the others, later, that they had battled guards and mercenaries across the fields and hills of Anais's mind. I heard their tales of winged foes, swords reaching from shadows that hadn't seemed to be there a moment ago. They didn't all say how they found out. But they, too, all knew what I know.\n\nNone of us volunteered to open our minds. None of us knew much of each other's pasts, and anything learned could be dangerous. In one way or another, we each knew that well. But some magic had trapped us in this room beyond even our  wizard Petunia's ability to figure out and counteract. If we waited too long, our bodies were drawn to the center. And the center drew us all together.\n\nPetunia was next.",

Crazy to think,  took a week for the evacuation to be completed. No one really knows who was the aggressor. Some say Javk the Barberian went crazy; found out his best friend Gavin Elustructrious had been doing his girlfriend. No matter though.\n\n\nCity is just rubble at this point. Steel skeletons of skyscrapers and towers. Main street ripped asunder. My ma, worker over in main street at a little diner called \"Luigi's Fat Rolls\", funny right? Luigi did have fat rolls!

This brings me to an interesting find. You wouldn't believe it, sis!\n\n\nI found this bunker! Was looking for trinkets around the towyard on the outskirts of Uptown. Figured that the rich had left some stuff. Hey! You can't blame a guy for wanting stuff. Anyway, this bunker right? Shit. That towyard had a lot of mystery. Big ass door with no discernable way to open it. Poked around and this painting on the wall, in the manager office? \n\n\nMovie trope of turning it? Yep, opened up that sucker. Now I'm here inside the bunker. Exploring it. Not much on first two floors. Now the floor I'm on? Jackpot! They were observing the fight! And it looks like they planned it to happen.

Here, lemme see something.\"\n\nI pull open the hatch on his back and tinker for a second, Dougie is sitting there like a bored teenager.  \n\n\"There, try that Dougie.\" \n\nHe springs to his feet and his motor function is increased 40 percent. \n\n\"I think you fixed it, thank you Master.\" \n\n\"Change settings... change name of owner... just call me Mac.\" \n\n\"Ok, Mac. What is today's mission?\" \n\n\"You're looking at it.\" He peers past my shoulder and sees the ruins of Fairchild City, smashed to bits by a clash of interstellar Super Humans. \n\nBuildings with holes punched through them, streets with hundred foot deep craters. Helicopters, tanks, and other armored vehicles are torn to shreds by bare hands, plasma and lasers, lying in the streets. \n\nThe dust clouds plume over a destroyed city, leaving a dark golden hue casted over it. \n\n\"It was a blood bath here Dougie... those Super Humans I told you about, this is what they did. We're gonna scrap what we can and get out before noon.\" \n\nI hear it's confirmation beep and we creep our way into the city. \"Release scout bots\". \n\nTwo baseball sized drones detach from Dougie and start getting aerial footage of the city. \"All is clear, Mac.\" \n\n\"Start the Lidar.\" \n\nLasers from the drones start mapping the area, slowly showing me a map of the ruins.  \n\n\"I have identified a point of interest, Mac. There is an unidentified craft buried in the subway system, but there is organic activity detected there.\" \n\nHair goes up on the back of my neck. \"Organic activity? Show me.\" \n\nA holographic screen is projected from Dougie and he shows me the area swamped with extraterrestrials trying to salvage the area, each of them carrying bounties in the 10s of millions. \n\n\"Looks like we're bounty hunters today Dougie. Proceed with Bounty Hunter Protocol.\" \n\nDougie changes his form and his hidden laser weopons are revealed. His legs detach and become a seperate robot, his arms do the same and his torso gain legs to become a robot dog. \n\nAll three robots tread silently and separate down a cavern carved into the street corner, and into the subway. \n\nI put on my goggles to watch Dougie at work. \n\nEach robot seperate again, into two. They silently position themselves in the subway, looking right at the Extraterrestrials. \n\n\"The Jhakt, these fucking guys\" I whisper to myself, before Dougie's seperate body parts each emit precision lasers through the forehead of each of the Jhakt. \n\n\"All hostiles are neutralized, Mac. We may proceed to point of interest.\" Dougie reassembles into a single robot again, after climbing from the crater. \n\nI hook on to a fire hydrant and repel into the crater. The entire area looks like a makeshift warehouse for aliens. \n\nI get to my feet and marvel at the alien tech the Jhakt were scavenging. \n\n\"That is not the point of interest, that is\" Dougie points at a huge security door. He walks over and puts his hacking tools into the door, long fiber optic wires with small robot claws at the end of little spaghetti arms. \n\nThe wires wiggle around and power is put into the door, bringing it online. Digital signals are sent through and they prompt the door to open. \n\nMy eyes open wide and adjust to the crazy lighting behind the door. It slowly comes to focus and I ses an alien room full of pods, each containing a Super Human in stasis. \n\n\"What the fuck Dougie?! These are the enemy! These guys destroyed this city. What if they wake up?!\" \n\n\"I have found sixty eight pieces of Camera footage while scanning the city. They each show these Super Humans saving civilians. They failed their mission, because this Pod was captured by the Jhakt, leaving four brave Super Humans to sacrifice themselves in the destruction of the invading forces.\" \n\nHe shows me a shakey cellphone video and it shows me four Super Humans that have enclosed the invading alien forces within a city block. \n\nIn a moments flash, each of the Super Humans self destruct, pushing enough energy from their core to explode, annihilating the aliens from existence. \n\n\"The chances of humanities survival are zero, without waking these Super Humans, Mac. My prime directive is humanities survival, so I must wake them...\" \n\n\"Oh fuck, dude! Oh, shit.\" There's nothing I can do, Dougie is designed to what it determines is certain for humanities survival and I was not expecting to find the only hope for humanity in the subway. \n\nDougie swiftly opens the pods and starts speaking a digital language with the computers onboard.  Pressure is let off of each pod and Co2 is ejected, bringing each pod upright. \n\nThe fear in me is at peak levels and I'm operating on a tenth of what Dougie knows.\n\nTheir eyes open and they take a deep breath. One of the men look right at me, who is frozen in spot. \n\n\"Hi... my robot said you guys were the only hope for humanity... uh... my name is Mac.\" I hold my hand out for a handshake, but he stares at my hand like it's a threat, increasing in breath.\n\n\"What earthly year is it?!\" He screams. \n\n\"It's 2050, the eighth of June.\" \n\n\"Fuck!\" He springs up and checks his computer. \"Shit, guys, you up? We missed the deadline. We got captured by Jhakt! What happened to our four brethren, Human?\" \n\n\"They sacrificed themselves and self destructed. They saved humanity.\" \n\nSadness comes over them, but they quickly swell in pride. \"They were true Heroes for the Federation.\" They all take a moment of silence. \n\nDougie interrupts the silence, \"humanity is still being invaded, by the Jhakt. Humanities chances of survival are zero. We need you to save humanity still.\" Dougie projects his simulation for the near future, where humanity is wiped from the planet by the Jhakt. \n\nI spent the next two years fighting the Jhakt with gorilla warfare, utilizing these Super Humans to surprise the enemy. \n\nSlowly we dominated and drove the Jhakt from Earth. We found the mother ship together and watched it erupt in nuclear explosions. \n\nWe all became silent heroes, never to be known, never heard in legend, recorded in no books. \n\nAll the Jhakt knew, was that their ships disappeared if they got too close to the Milky Way Galaxy.",

The streets were wide but clean, the buildings stood so tall you could barely make out the top of them and areas of lush green parks which made it feel just that little bit more homely. The gleam of the city was almost sterile, but it also felt alive because its residents. We still went to bars and partied, we played in those parks, there were even designated areas to graffiti which reset every couple of weeks. Yes, most signs were now holograms, but it still felt like the kind of city that had existed for millennia, unchanging yet becoming more modernised every decade.\n\nThe came that day. The day that one fight destroyed everything that had been built, literally and figuratively. The city officials tried to keep them from using the city like a glorified laser tag arena, but they decided they knew better. Emergency evacuation orders were given but Fairchild was doomed.\n\nI still remember the mushroom cloud to this day.\n\nThis all happened 10 years ago, and the city was a far cry from its original splendour. Most building in the epicentre of it all had been completely razed, a crater now occupying their footprint and the site of the villain’s final defeat. Only one of the skyscrapers stood now, barely even standing as it was. Huge holes had been blown into the side of it, electrical wiring and rebar sticking out at jagged angles making the holes appear like many mouths about to take a bite of whatever came too close.\n\nRubble piles the size of small complexes lined the streets now, however over the decade they had compacted to become stable enough to clamber over and comb through the remains left after this devastation. I had already been handed the things from my apartment which somehow survived the explosion. A small box of memories that barely filled the gap of overwhelming loss the destruction had left. After a few years, the government declared the city abandoned and categorised each section as safe or unsafe, trying to prevent the inevitable. Many people had scavenged what they could from the safe areas of the city, only a few reckless fools would dare venture into the unsafe areas and closer to the epicentre of it all.\n\nI had already found a few pieces which I could take back and sell from the unsafe zone, but I could see a few more people getting brave and looting from an area close to me. Running into someone while out here was just asking for trouble so I quickly diverted my tracks pushing much closer than I had ever dared to go before. Rounding another rubble pile I spotted a building that was miraculously still standing and looked to be one of the businesses that took up residence in the uptown area of Fairchild city.\n\n*“What have I got to lose….”* I thought before deciding. Fuck it.",

Please.\"\n\nI winced at the pressure, squirming to break free of his hold. It was painfully strong, unlike him at all. Grabbing his arm, I tried to pull it off whilst grunting. \"Let... go...\"\n\nHe blinked, shaking his head as he realised what he was doing. I sucked a breath in as he released me, panic filling his expression. \"I-I'm sorry. Libby, please don't say anything about this. About me. I... I'll explain later. After school.\"\n\nRubbing my shoulder, I glanced behind him. The transparent wings stuck out, oval shapes making me think of dragonflies. The edges shivered, as he seemed to flex them. I wasn't used to seeing him like this. He was usually so calm, and happy to talk.\n\nSwallowing, I gave him a nod. \"Ok.\"\n\nHe gave me a strained smile, just as the bell went off. Straightening our uniforms, we ran to class, not wanting to be late.\n\n\\-----\n\nHe came up to me as we were leaving for the day. I hadn't been able to keep my eyes off him, and those wings. The way people ignored when they brushed against them. Or how if they knocked things off the side, it was blamed om the wind or improper stacking.\n\nGavin nudged my arm, his backpack on his chest, as he alway had it. He gave me a very unconvincing smile, gesturing with his head. \"Lets go.\"\n\nWe walked in silence for a bit. I kept glancing at him, or rather, his wings. I wanted to ask, but wasn't sure how.\n\nThankfully he saved me from that. He gave a quick peek around, before still speaking quietly. \"So... I have wings.\"\n\nI paused, before giggling a little. It was so serious and matter of fact, I found it ridiculous. His eyes seemed to twinkle, as I found my words to reply. \"Really? I hadn't noticed.\"\n\nIt earned me a brief smirk. One that died as he sighed, licking his lips once. \"Yeah. Um... n-normally people can't see them. It's a glamour of a kind. But for some reason you can now. And I... I don't know why.\"\n\nI frowned. \"You've always had them? What are you, a fairy?\"\n\nGavin sighed. \"Not fully. Half. Mum... well, she wasn't human.\"\n\nHis confession shocked me. I froze in place, gobsmacked. \"You're serious? A fairy?\"\n\nHe winced. \"Yeah... we... we don't reveal it to most people. Anyone really, besides those we trust. Or... those who find out on accident.\"\n\nI shivered at a sudden breeze. His gaze wandered from me, before jumping back to my face. \"What?\"\n\nGavin sighed again. \"Nothing... its... I'm sorry.\"\n\nI felt it then. Someone behind me, who I couldn't see. But I felt their presence, tall and thin. A hand not there rested on my shoulder, the same one he touched. Then was a voice, whispered by the winds. \"Is this the one, half-breed?\"\n\nI couldn't move, or speak, utterly paralysed by the touch. Gavin stared over me, speaking quickly. \"Lord, please, don't hurt her.\"\n\nThe whisper came again. \"Harm is not mine to cause, as you should know, if you studied the Court. But her memory is mine to take, and the Sight to seal.\"\n\nIn horror I watched him nod. He looked down to meet my gaze, pain and sorry on his face. \"Libby, I'm sorry. But I... I'm not allowed to let anyone know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. At least... at least you won't remember this.\"\n\nCold fingers clutched at my head, as I felt the world withdraw from me.\n\n\\-----\n\nI jumped, realising I was at home. I was on my bed, still fully dressed. Rubbing my pounding head, I sat up, sliding off to head to my desk. A simple button push let it start up, as I took a seat. The load up took an age, before I could open up the Internet.\n\nThere I typed in the only word in my mind. **Fairy**.",

Raymond was next to her staring at his forearm engaged in a game of Cement Age Warfare. Their parents Albert and Minnie stood above them. \n\nAlbert looked at his son and cleared his throat. Raymond didn't respond. Minnie glanced at her husband with disbelief and cleared her throat louder. The game continued to monopolize Raymond's attention. Ethel elbowed her brother in the side.\n\n\"They mean you idiot,\" she said.\n\n\"Ethel, don't use that word.\" Albert quickly responded to his daughter. Raymond continued to play his game. \"But also son please minimize the game.\"\n\n\"I am about to go up in rank,\" he said. Minnie sighed and pulled out the connection control. With a flick of her finger, her son's computer was disconnected from the system. Raymond looked at his parents with anger. Then, he crossed his arms and pouted like his sister.\n\nAlbert sat next to Ethel while Minnie took Raymond. They put their arms around their kids and logged into the Savanna Stream. Their irises turned bright blue, their nostrils flared, and the hairs on their bodies stood. Around 400,000 km away, four butterflies activated in Africa. \n\nThey insect drones danced around each other in an elaborate pattern to disguise their presence as they moved along the preset route. The exterior was the camera lens allowing the surroundings to be viewed from any perspective. It was the latest in safari technology, and Raymond and Ethel found it boring.\n\n\"Look kids a zebra,\" Minnie said. Several zebra galloped nearby. \"You like zebras don't you Ethel?\"\n\n\"I like Zebrois. These don't look like they have any genetic modifications,\" Ethel said.\n\n\"I think I killed them in my games,\" Raymond said.\n\n\"Don't say that son,\" Albert replied. The butterflies continued on their track and passed a march of the elephants.\n\n\"Wow, that's amazing. Can you believe their size?\" Albert asked.\n\n\"Dad, both our rockets are bigger than them,\" Ethel said.\n\n\"I've killed them in a game too,\" Raymond said.\n\n\"That's enough talk about killing animals son,\" Albert said. A pride of lions inhabited the rocks nearby.\n\n\"Wow, so vicious,\" Minnie said.\n\n\"Mom, their not doing anything,\" Raymond replied. Minnie bit her tongue. She had to admit he was right. They were lying on the rocks resting.\n\n\"They're preparing for the hunt.\" Albert reached over and pushed his son playfully. \"You like that don't you.\"\n\n\"They are so lame. They can't even shoot lasers out of their eyes,\" Ethel said.\n\n\"Sweetie, they are the basis for your genetically modified creatures. Also, Earth is humanity's homerock. It's important to show it due reverence,\" Minnie said.\n\n\"Why? It's such a lame place. Nothing interesting happens there,\" Raymond said.\n\n\"Don't say that about Earthlings,\" Minnie replied.\n\n\"He's right. If everything and everyone who is cool left,\" Ethel added. \n\n\"That's enough you two.\" Albert paused the program. \"I have no idea what's wrong with this generation. You have absolutely no respect. We paid a lot of money for access to this experience.\"\n\n\"Too much money,\" Raymond said.\n\n\"Not now son,\" Minnie said.\n\n\"I can excuse such behavior if you thought about the future at all, but you don't. You both just sit around playing on your games or watching the screens. You've lived all your life on terraformed material and metal that you have no idea about true character. I won't tolerate that anymore,\" Albert said. \n\n\"What's that mean?\" Ethel's eyes widened as she figured out what her father was getting at.\n\n\"Whatever.\" Raymond rolled his eyes still unaware.\n\n\"School is out in a few weeks, and we enrolled you in a program that'll take you around Earth to explore the important historic and natural sites,\" Minnie said. Both kids stood up in terror.\n\n\"Mom, Suzie went down there for Spring Break. She said it smelled awful,\" Ethel said.\n\n\"Do you know how bad connections are down there?\" Raymond asked.\n\n\"No buts, this weekend excursion was your last test, and you failed,\" Albert said. Ethel sat back on the couch with her eyes front and arms at her side.\n\n\"Let me retake it. I'll pass this time.\"\n\n\"That won't demonstrate character at all,\" he said.\n\n\"You guys are the worst.\" Raymond stormed off.\n\n\"I agree. I don't some stupid rock to teach me morality,\" Ethel said. Minnie looked at her husband.\n\n\"Are you sure we made the right choice?\"\n\n\"I know we did. One way or another, they'll get the grid they need on Earth,\" Albert said.",

His blood dripped from my sword.\n\n\"How dare you, human, meddle in affairs of the dragonkin!\" he roared. \"The weakling must be killed!\"\n\n\"That weakling just earned you a wound of the kind you haven't sustained in centuries. And will get you killed if you don't yield!\"\n\n\"What nonsense are you spewing, human? The weakling couldn't even scratch my scales! He's the smallest and weakest in the litter! It's only due to your meddling...\"\n\n\"It's only thanks to his strength, that I'm meddling. I am extension of his strength. I will not let you kill my young brother. His strength is my strength, and my strength is his. If you fail to grasp that concept, you're the weak one. Stand down!\"\n\n\"You insolent human! I will turn you to ash!\" roared the dragon. A blindingly bright yellow sphere began growing between his jaws.\n\nI reached out my free hand. \"Create Water\", I commanded, sending my mana to the location occupied by the sphere. A simple level 1 spell, the ball of water wouldn't be bigger than an orange. It was only somewhat effective against lesser dragons, but the kind of heat The Great One packed made it mighty. It wouldn't just boil and sizzle off - it would evaporate in an instant.\n\nThe explosion rocked the mountains, the sphere of condensation spreading from the elder dragon's jaw at speed of sound, his head sent back like a rag doll, slamming into the ceiling of his den cavern, spewing rock everywhere. He staggered, then struggled back to his feet. \"I hate magic.\" he muttered.\n\n\"And yet, this magic is Lynn's to command. No other dragon could wield it against you. You have an outdated view of what strength means.\"\n\nA low growl escaped the monster's throat.\n\n\"Do you think the human king is weak?\" I continued. \"Hit of his sword wouldn't notch your scales. But if he commands the army to do so, he will wipe your kind off the face of the world. This is his strength. And I am the strength of Lynn. Test it some more if you dare.\"\n\nThe growl subsided. \"Go. Get lost. Take your 'strength' somewhere else.\" he spat after me, spewing a small cloud of fire.\n\n\"Until next time then!\" I waved, sheathing my sword. I turned to the young scared drake cowering behind me. \"Come, Lynn, we're done here.\" \n\nThe drake closed his eyes and bowed his head. \"Thank you, brother\", he said quietly.",

He would have hated the name, for he fought it with every step of his existence trying harder each day to become a leading and strong member of the pack, for while Tiny was small in stature, his personality and companionship was immense. The small black, shiny scales caught my eyes one day when I saw movement from behind the tall water grasses. I ventured closer to investigate the creature and found a small and awkward looking dragon. It was rare these days to find them out in the wild. Dragons were typically bred for speed and size in Caleton, they were far more useful for transportation and combat when bred from choice parental lines and raised on specific, high protein diets. Days after hatching the young dragons would be pitted against one another in shows of little puffs of smoke and gnashing of slender, sharp milk teeth. Only the strongest survived, and so only the strongest dragons would continue on to become part of the militia. This made finding a dragon, especially this near to the center of Caleton, a rare and special occasion. I pulled out some dried rabbit I had planned to snack on near the creak bed before returning home, a small piece of meat rested on my outstretched palm. The small and timid creature poked its shiny wet nose between the brush and slowly sniffed the air near my fingertips before timidly but quickly snatching the snack and pulling its neck back behind the grass. I named him tiny because amongst the grass and rocks he nearly blended in to his surroundings, one could easily mistake him for a small stone against the larger boulders behind him. I ventured closer and tiny reluctantly came forward once more sniffing the air in search of more food. I complied and shared the rest of my dried meat with him along the rocks allowing the created to climb into my lap and then onto my shoulder. From the day forward tiny became my best friend, and while I love to dwell on the happy memories made along the way with my pal, it eventually leads to reflecting on his tragic demise. I will never forgive Caleton for sacrificing my friend simply for being … well, tiny.",

        "body": "Guard Commander Goff looked up from his maps, but the grim look on his second in command's face told him all he needed to know.\n\n\"At our current pace, we'll reach Mistvale Gate by evening. If conditions are good on the other slope, three days to Vantris, sir.\"\n\n\"And our supplies?\"\n\n\"If we limit to half-rations and assuming no casualties, maybe another two.\"\n\nGoff cursed under his breath. The supplies from Garenbrig should have been enough to see them through the Mistvale pass and on to Vantris with plenty of food to spare. Unfortunately, the spring snowstorm had slowed their pace to a crawl; if Goff hadn't taken the traitor's head himself, he would have suspected Donovan's magical hand \"adjusting\" the weather.\n\nJohannes waited patiently as a dozen scenarios played out behind Goff's eyes. A group of nobles loyal to the youngest of the three royal children had assassinated the king and the elder prince. With Commander Goff leading the way, the fifty or so loyal men of the Royal Guard had spirited the princess and her attendant from the castle. \n\n\"Break camp,\" Goff said quietly in the twilight of early morning. \"We leave at dawn.\" \n\n---\n\n\"How in the bloody hells did they catch up to us so fast?\" \n\nGoff hoisted the princess into the saddle in front of him, placing himself as a human shield between any potential archers and his charge. While Goff had expected the prince's forces to be hot on their heels, the rebels must have pushed their horses to exhaustion to make up the distance. \n\n\"Make for the Gate,\" the commander's voice boomed across the battlefield; a mass of deep blue uniforms and barding surged forward the final few hundred meters. The forward scouts followed their directions to the letter, and the massive portcullises slammed shut behind the Guards.\n\nIn simpler times, the Mistvale Gate was little more than a border crossing; a checkpoint to deter smugglers. As relations between Garenbrig and Vantris fluctuated over the generations, both sides had expanded and reinforced their guard stations. Eventually, constant riverboat traffic supplanted the periodic caravans, and the strategic value of holding the mountain pass in times of peace dwindled. Over the winter months, even the skeleton crews that manned the station were recalled to nearby villages. Yet the structure remained and was maintained; pairs of thick stone walls and heavy iron gates easily bared the narrowest section of the pass. \n\n\"Your High…\" Goff stopped short as he dismounted and handed the reigns to a Lieutenant who brought another pair of horses. \"Your Majesty. This is where we part ways.\"\n\nMaria von Garenbrig frowned at the change in address. Though she knew her father and Gregory were likely dead, her heart rebelled at taking up the mantle of queen while there was still a chance they had been captured instead. She knew this coup had been orchestrated by her younger brother, but part of her did not want to believe Philip capable of regicide.\n\nAfter a moment, the meaning of his words became clear. \"You mean to make some heroic last stand in this place?\" Maria's voice raised menacingly. \"Sacrificing yourself and your men for what? To buy me an extra candlemark, an extra day?\"\n\n\"A sennight, hopefully. Vantris is two days from here on a fast horse. Our men there have kept the Queen apprised of the situation; and the young Lady Lyra has already pledged to back your bid for the throne. They are ready to march under your banner given the word.\"\n\n\"She has always held you in high regard, my Lady,\" the attendant interjected. \"Besides, given the choice between a beloved sister-in-law and her betrothed's killer, her support is only natural.\"\n\nThe young queen settled into the saddle. \"Enough. I assume Johannes, Sally and Lieutenant Jorge here are to be my guards, then? Commander, on the battlefield you technically outrank me; and you have decades more experience than I. But is there anything I could say to talk you out of this strategy? I would do all I can to avoid putting you in harm's way without necessity.\"\n\n\"Begging your pardon, Majesty\", Johannes said quietly. \"But any danger we are in is Lord Philip's doing. We swore to protect you, and we intend to do just that.\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the commander concurred. \"All of us here knew the risk; to a man, we marched from Garenbrig so that you could survive and lead our nation. And your best chance at survival is beyond the Gate, so long as we hold your brother's force here.\"\n\n\"Fine, we ride for Vantris,\" Maria said through gritted teeth. \"You had better survive, Commander.\"\n\n\"It's been a pleasure serving you, your Majesty.\" Goff nodded and turned to his men as his Queen and her three guards trotted through the rear gate. \n\n\"Alright, we've got about a half a mark until those damn traitors try to breach. You four, swap the walkways on the Vantris side to defensive position; you six, check that building for emergency supplies and move them behind the second gate. If those bastards breach, we'll back up and do it again from their wall. Archers to the ramparts, tortoise at the gate.\n\n\"We've got one chance to do this; we damn well are going to do it right. I don't give a damn if they have five times the men we do; because those blasted whoresons can't hold a candle to the Royal Guard.\"\n\nA rough cheer arose from the ranks, and Goff continued. \"Maria von Garenbrig rides to Vantris for reinforcements. She has cried with you, she has bled with you, and you all know if I hadn't sent her ahead, she would have taken up the sword and like as not died with you. But we are the Royal Guard.\"\n\nGoff looked over the troops, as if committing each face to memory. \"We swore to protect the von Garenbrig line. We failed at the castle, and the King is dead. But I swear upon this sword, I will not fail again. Long Live the Queen.\"\n\nThe resulting cry continued to echo through the narrow pass long after the battle began.",

        "body": "The smith let her hammer fall to her side, the young man's panicked cries sounding over the ringing in her ears. He threw open the smithy gate and charged towards the forge, still shouting for help even as their eyes met.\n\nOut of habit, the smith's eyes traveled over the young man's equipment, searching for faults or failings and finding none. This was as it should be - she had sent him on his way with the sturdiest steel she could craft. Knights across the lands might envy the quality of her work, and it would serve him well for a lifetime of conflict.\n\n\"What is it boy? Cease wailing and tell thy trouble plain.\"\n\nHe stood panting, finally silent though resentment shone in his eye at her brusque question. The smith cared little--others might quail at the thought of his father's displeasure, but she knew the Duke could ill afford to dispense with a smith's services. So long as she brought no harm to the boy, she could afford his displeasure.\n\n\"It's Azure. The blade cannot be drawn! I must have a new oathblade to serve me in battle!\"\n\nThe smith sighed. She was surprised this day was so long in coming. The brat treated Azure as a simple tool, respecting neither the sword's dignity nor its vows. That he compounded his disgrace by demanding a fresh oathblade was just another layer to the lad's farcical attempt at playing hero.\n\n\"Hand me Azure, boy.\"\n\nHe glowered at her. \"My name is Sir Gannet, smith. You will address me properly.\"\n\n\"You are 'boy.' Until thy senses come un-addled and thy proper place be learned, thou shall remain 'boy.' Now place Azure in my hand or else run to thy father and share with the Duke thy predicament.\"\n\nThe boy grumbled, but relented under the smith's hardened gaze. With ill grace, he tugged Azure's scabbard loose from his back and made as if to draw the blade. His hand paused on the hilt, though, and after another moment of hesitation he placed the undrawn sword in the smith's outstretched hand.\n\nThe smith felt the oathblade's presence the moment it rested in her grip, and in her mind she retraced the tenets that bound the blade to service. It was a familiar catechism, and one that sent her momentarily into the realm of buried memory: sword song, battle cry, the flash of steel and the ring of metal against metal...\n\nShe returned to the present and, gently, drew Azure from its leather binding. The silver-blue of the blade caught the sun, and even \"Sir\" Gannet's irritation was replaced by a look of wonder. The smith felt tears in her eyes as the memories subsided, leaving only the dull ache of an old, poorly-healed wound.\n\n\"What is an oathblade, boy?\"\n\nGannet's attention was drawn reluctantly back to the smith.\n\n\"A powerful weapon against the forces of darkness, a blade that can only be wielded by those of noble blood who...\"\n\n\"Wrong.\" The smith cut him off forcefully, still holding Azure unmoving before her.\n\n\"You recite the myths of self-important lords and sorry knights who have never wielded such a duty. An oathblade is a distillation of purpose, given form by one who gave their life for an ideal. An oathblade is, in every sense, the person who created it.\"\n\nShe transfixed the young nobleman with a gaze of hot iron, and he took a step back in trepidation.\n\n\"Recite the oath and say truthfully why Azure will not strike for thee.\"\n\nThe boy began spluttering, and the smith's patience finally shattered like brittle steel.\n\n\"Recite the oath, boy!\"\n\nCowed, he finally spoke the words. \"I am shield, not blade. I am servant, not lord. I am guardian and guide, and shall pray for peace even in the midst of war.\"\n\nIt was a simple oath. The oath of a soldier who had devoted herself with every iota of her existence to the cause of peace and righteousness. The smith's eyes blurred as she remembered the first time that oath had been spoken aloud, and the first time she had swung Azure through the chest of an enemy. Suddenly, she could not bear to look upon the beautiful blade and slid it reverently back into its scabbard.\n\n\"That oath is not just words, boy. They must be meant. Azure shall not swing for thee if thy words are false. She can read thy heart sure as any augur. She'll know if thy heart is untrue.\"\n\nRage, frustration, and shame warred across the young nobleman's face. Finally, he stormed from the smithy without a word, leaving Azure where it lay, sheathed in the smith's hand.\n\nShe watched him go, anger on her face and sorrow in her heart, before whispering finally. \"I'm sorry, love. One day we'll find thy new knight.\"\n\nOnce more, and with no more ease than the first time she had done so, the smith set aside her sword and took up her hammer.",

A small cabin sat on the other side, grey smoke lazily drifting up into the sky from its chimney. The word of the king was law, and never once had damocles even thought to question it in his many years of service to the empire, but now …\nSeeing the small child running and playing through the grass below gave him pause. He served the king his whole life since the age of eighteen, as had his father and his fathers father. Sixty years of service to the royal family and never once had he defied an order of the king, so why pause now. He had committed atrocities the world over, why pause now?\n\nAfter a moment he steeled himself and walked down the hill, followed by a pair of young knights. Konrad and Sylvain had been in service of the crown barely five years, hungry to prove themselves no matter the atrocity. No doubts they wouldn't waste a moment's hesitation.\nThe child had noticed them now, running up to the trio excitedly he exclaimed, “Woah! Are you knights? Real knights?” His voice filled the wonder and curiosity that only a young child could have.\n\nMost children were scared of Damocles, his face hidden behind a mask of gold molded after the god of war. But this boy had no fear, only awe and wonder at meeting a knight of the king up close.\n\nAt the commotion a woman came from the house, her eyes wild with fear at the sight of the three knights before her son, who turned to her and exclaimed excitedly, “Look Mama look! Knights! Real knights!” The woman covered her mouth, leaning against a post to avoid collapsing. No doubt that she knew what was about to happen, powerless to stop it.\n\nDamocles heard a snicker from Konrad to his left, though he was smart enough to remain silent. Damocles silently reached for his sword, feeling a tremble in his hand as he grabbed the hilt. The boy turned to look at the knights, confusion falling over his face.\n\n‘You cannot return home until you kill this child,’ the king's words echoed through his mind again and the aged knight steeled his resolve, pulling the shining blade from its hilt. This child was the son of the king's late brother, the only remaining heir to the throne. With this child dead his majesty's rule would be absolute and unchallenged.\n\n“Face your mother child,” Damocles ordered the boy, “I will make this quick.” Again a snicker escaped Konrad’s lips as the boy timidly turned towards his mother, the woman now sitting on the ground as tears filled her eyes. Damocles swung, his sword meeting its mark as blood quickly spattered the ground. \n\nKonrad gasped for air that would not come, falling to his knees drowning in his own blood as he held the gash across his throat. He had not hit the ground before Damocles turned on Sylvain, thrusting his sword up from low stabbing into the man from under his chest piece and up towards his heart.\n\nTrue to his word, Damocles had made it quick, the two men falling dead in seconds as he slashed the air to rid his word of their blood. “Go to your mother,” Damocles ordered the boy, “And do not turn around.”\n\nThe seriousness in his voice compelled the child to obey, quickly running to his sobbing mother as she took her son into her arms. Damocles followed as his sword rested into its sheath on his hip, “Why?” the mother asked, her voice shaking from a mix of relief and dread.\n\n“Suppose I've grown soft in my old age,” Damocles replied as he stepped up onto the porch, “Pack your things, we must move quickly.” Any protest from the boy was quickly shushed as his mother ushered him inside, struggling to her feet so she could stand face to mask with Damocles.\n\n“Do not thank me yet,” Damocles said, cutting off any words before the mother could speak, “As long as that boy draws breath his uncle will wish him dead. We must head north towards the border. The journey will be long but he will be far safer in Asterik, we must move quickly.”\n\nBreath still shaky, the mother nodded and retreated inside the house. As the pair packed Damocles moved the bodies of the young knights into the center of the cabin, tossing a sheet over them as the mother and son left the building.\n\nDamocles walked out behind them, dusting a powder as he went. With a snap of his fingers it ignited, the wooden cabin becoming engulfed in flames in mere moments. The boy began to cry as he left behind the only home he had ever known, carried in his mothers arms as Damocles led the trio through the woods. “Do not cry for what is lost boy,” Damocles said in some attempt of comfort, “we all leave behind our home today.”\n\n‘You cannot return home until you've killed this child,’ again the words of the king echoed through his mind. The harbinger of war could not bring himself to kill but one small child, and so Damocles would never return to his home again. And yet, taking a look back at the mother quietly comforting her son in her arms, he felt something he had not felt in many many years, as if part of his soul had returned from a long absence. He had something that was worth fighting for.",

The Great Flame Dragon of the 18th Mirror Dimension, Fluffy!\" I said.  \nFluffy on my shoulder puffed a bit of flames, proudly flapping its little furry wings.  \nThe prof. laughed.\n\n  \n\"Great.   \nAs someone whom came from an artistic background, I knew you would do great things here.  \nNever over-question, and doubt, but also never take anything for granted!  \nYou are doing great.  \nHow are your mana reserves?\" he smiled.  \n\"Great.  \nAfter contracting Fluffy, they increased roughly 984.3 times.  \nIt puts me on the verge of becoming a great mage.\" I said.  \nHe nodded.  \n\"How about the connection the Mirror Dimension?\" he continued.  \n\"Shaky. The laws of physics there seem to be extremely different from ours, leaning towards gravity, and the elements, but with no clear spatial, and temporal laws.\" I said.  \nHe sighed.\n\n\n\n\"It is difficult to find rhyme or reason in this domain.  \nAll we can compare it is with our reality, but when the laws of physics are different...  \nWe enter the domain of metaphysics.\" he said.  \n\"Yeah, sometimes I wonder if Mirror Dimension 18 is inside of me or not...considering Fluffy does appear from within.\" I said.  \n\"Yes, that was a theory, that our bodies are connected to the universe, and through this connection to the infinite parallel dimensions, but enough with theories.  \nToday, I will teach you how to control the elements.\" he said, as five pillars, each of one of the elements rose, filled with magic power.  \nI smiled, and took out my notebook, ready to learn.  \nI loved this university, even if once I got lost in a world of complete darkness.",

Could there be more to this world than our mortal plane?\n\n\"Yeah, the first thing that tipped me off was the toilet seat,\" Zak says. He's led the team into the bathroom. \"I like to leave it up--for convenience, y'know? But then I come back later, and it's always down.\"\n\nHere we go again. You and Zak have always diverged on housekeeping--and frankly, you're tired of cleaning up after him. Let him have his raised seat. See if you care. You hold your breath as one of the ghost hunters--a man in a Rick-and-Morty t-shirt and a leather top-hat--inspects the toilet seat.\n\n\"What other phenomena have you observed?\" the ghost hunter asks. He scratches a patchy goatee. \"When we talked on the phone, you made it sound like most of the occurrences were in the bathroom.\"\n\n\"That's correct. Like sometimes I'll come in here, and all my old q-tips will be in the trash. Now I *know* they didn't just fall in there on their own.\"\n\nThe ghost hunter nods solemnly. From his duster, he produces a machine you've never seen before: a beeping black box with a long metal probe, a needle trembling in a fluorescent gage. This, he explains, is a spectralphotometer.\n\nYou've always been an atheist, proud of your critical reasoning--and perhaps this is why such a machine impresses you. The ghost hunter explains his device, and soon you're holding your breath, entranced by so many mechanical details, this unflinching, quantifiable approach to the occult. Ghosts can't be real. Still, what if this machine says otherwise? Can you still call yourself a man of science? You clutch your chains. You fret at the hem of the bedsheet that's also the entirety of your body.\n\n\"So you see,\" the ghost hunter concludes, \"if there's a ghost, this bad boy will let us know.\"\n\n\"Then what?\"\n\n\"Then we bring in the sage.\"\n\nYou gag.\n\nYou've always hated sage.\n\n[my substack ](https://open.substack.com/pub/jaywilcoxworx?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android&r=4eb8pj)\n\n[my subreddit ](https://www.reddit.com/r/jworx_531/)\n\n[jaywilcoxwriter.net](https://www.jaywilcoxwriter.net/)",

Hair’s gettin’ too long, look!” Cade said, and turned around to point at his straight dark brown hair that stops just before his little shoulder blades. \n\n“You walked here all by yourself? Or Mom or Pop drive yall?” \n\n“We hoofed it - CJ did most of the walkin’ though. I just held on. We was goin’ pretty fast, too!” \n\n“Hop in a seat kid, CJ, you do your thing.” \n\nI ran to the back to grab the hedge trimmers and branch shears for CJ, and lined him up first. He always seems to enjoy the spa treatment. Cade was hanging out playing games on his phone, until it was his turn. \n\n“Alright bud, your turn.” I threw the cape around Cade, hanging out in his booster seat on my chair. “Just a trim?” \n\n“Dang right!” \n\nI whipped out my spray bottle like a Colt Single Action army and fanned the trigger to wet the boy’s hair, making him giggle like always. I trimmed up his locks with my scissors, pulling my classic gags like spinning the chair around or flipping his hair in front of his face. By the end, his cheeks were red, and his hair was looking handsome. \n\n“Ready for the buzz, buddy?” I asked, getting my buzzer out, for Cade’s favorite part. He voluntarily pulled his hair out of the way, and I could see his eager grin in the mirror. \n\nI buzzed the back of his neck to get all the peach fuzz and residual unkempt hair off (which, for a kid, he’s got a lot of, for some reason) and Cade sunk back in the chair, a bigger smile cracking across his face revealing his big, raggled, 3rd grader teeth, as a stout giggle plused out of his mouth. \n\n“Alright, pass number two,” I said, and went again. It’s completely unnecessary, but Cade likes it so much I always do it again just to make him happy. I guess the back-of-the-neck buzz does feel pretty good. \n\n“Hot towel?” \n\n“Heck yeah…” Cade replied, unbuttoning his cape, as I brought out the mint oil-soaked spa treatment and wiped down his head and neck. \n\nI set him loose, and he peered into the mirror all giddy as usual. \n\n“It’s awesome, Jimmy!” He exclaimed, and dug in his shorts pocket, shoving a carefully folded but now slightly crumpled twenty dollar bill. \n\n“Let’s see it in beast form, huh?” I asked. He jumped at that, and dashed over to CJ, getting a nod of approval from his beast buddy. \n\nCJ bent down and allowed Cade to grab his head, touching their foreheads together. I saw a flash of amber light where they touched, a gust of wind emanated from them, and Cade began to transform:\n\nHe wasn’t wearing any shoes, the wild child he is, so I could see his feet grow a bit longer, sprout some soft, thick canine hair from the ankle down, and his toes form into paw toes with claws and pads and the whole deal. He stood up just a bit on them, keeping his now-furry heel about two inches off the ground. \n\nHis forearms and hands sprouted similar hair, and his five fingers on each sprouted short, sharp claws. His teeth grew bigger and sharper, the bridge of his nose and sprouting a small sprinkle of light brown fur. Two canine ears popped out of his head, and just above them, two small deer antlers, sharp and pointed forward, for attack. \n\nHe jumped up and down, trying to get my attention, where I had already given all of it to him. He let out a sharp, high, raspy bark, like a fox. \n\n“How do I look? Is it cool? Do I look like a vicious predator?” He excitedly asked me. \n\n“Frickin’ killer, kiddo. Hurry back to your parents, now. They’ll wanna see it too.” \n\n“Okay! Bye! Thanks!” He shouted, and the two of them trotted off, the boy still in his were-wendigo form. \n\nHope he don’t scare the townsfolk. Well, most of em already know who he is and why. Still can’t believe this quaint little rural town holds a kid who’s the avatar of a nature god destined to save the world, or somethin’…",

He wasn't in his own body, but the entire situation was his mistake. He'd learned just enough magic to be dangerous to himself, and that mystical knowledge came from Sharp Development. As soon as he decided things had gone wrong, he dragged his friend to their offices, and now they sat in front of a red-haired man in a white suit named Phoenix. \n\n\n\n“Don't gotta believe you,” Phoenix grinned as golden stars glowed in his eyes for a brief moment. “I can see your souls are connected. That's not a simple spell. Accidental soul fusion aside…,” Phoenix changed his gaze to the man with dark hair to follow the shifting spirit. Their souls were joined together at the ends, forming a complete circle that rotated between both bodies. “... You do seem to have a knack for spell work.”\n\n\n\n“How did you know we changed bodies again?” the blonde man asked. \n\n\n\n“He said he can see us,” the accidental mage shook his head of dark hair at his friend's confusion. He couldn't blame him, they were both going through a lot. \n\n\n\n“His eyes weren't glowing then!” \n\n\n\n“That flash was for your benefit, I can see you just fine…,” he was talking to the blonde man, then turned to the other. They’d switched again. “... Even without the stars in my eyes.” \n\n\n\n“And you said you can help us, right? How?” The blonde man asked. \n\n\n\n“Of course,” Phoenix nodded. “Help will be here in just a moment, and you'll each have your own body back. Except.. Which ones are you supposed to be in?”\n\n\n\n“I'm Parker, I’m supposed to be in that body,” the dark-haired man pointed at the other.\n\n\n\n“I’m Liam, that one’s my body,” the blonde man nodded at the dark-haired one. As he answered the question, the office door opened. A pale teenager with crimped rainbow hair wearing a red blazer walked in as both men turned toward the sound. \n\n\n\n“Gentlemen, this is Bijou. She’ll solve your problem in a jiffy,” he said. \n\n\n\n“Are you a unicorn?” Liam asked from the blonde body. The magic he learned also went over magical creatures. The rainbow hair wasn’t a surefire giveaway; but, Bijou also had bright pink eyes. \n\n\n\n“Something like that,” she nodded with a neutral, almost rigid expression. “Stand up,” she said and both men rose to their feet. \n\n\n\n“Is this going to hurt?” Parker asked. They’d switched again and he was in the blonde body now.\n\n\n\n“Is it going to take long?” Liam asked.  Bijou gave each of them an extended look to communicate she’d heard them, and then she answered them both with a single answer. \n\n\n\n“No.” \n\n\n\n“You’ll have to excuse her, gentlemen, Bijou is in a bit of a rush. I had to call her away from something else for this, it’ll be over in a second.” \n\n\n\nBijou moved back, but the desk was in her way, so she walked between the two men to stand between them and the door. At seeing this, Phoenix stood from his own seat and moved to one side of the room.\n\n\n\n“Why are you going over -,” Parker started to ask, but Bijou drew their attention.\n\n\n\n“Focus on me,” she said. “Don’t move,” she added once both men were facing her. Her eyes darted around as if checking the finer points of their positions, then she gave a subtle nod. \n\n\n\n“Ready.” She said it, then remained still. \n\n\n\n“Do we need to do anything?” Liam asked. He was currently in the blonde body. \n\n\n\n“Just stay quiet and still, please. Gotta time it right,” Phoenix answered. \n\n\n\nLiam went silent and waited. It was something he hadn’t quite had a chance to do since the fusion; it was nice to see Parker could stay quiet too. Now that there was nothing else competing for his attention, Liam could feel the shift happen. He could feel himself leaving the blonde body and gaining the familiar sensations of his own. \n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day. This is story #2693 in a row.

Clarity?  \nIt was weird.\n\n  \nI got home, to a loving wife, but I could see her actions, her words were...rehearsed.  \n\"Honey...where are the kids?\" I asked.  \n\"It is 9 P.M., they always feel sleepy because of the pills at this hour.  \nAre you okay?\" she asked worriedly.  \nI nodded.  \n\"You know, we could ask the government to allow us to you know, alter our pills a bit...  \nMaybe we could have another kid?\" she purred.  \nI blushed, but then this disgust hit me.  \n\"H-honey...how are the pills you get labelled?\" I asked.  \nShe stared at me, and giggled.\n\n  \n\"Silly! You know all wives get the same! Love, loyalty, and other basic housewife traits!  \nJust like how you get hard-working, kind, and other husbandly traits!\" she said.  \nI shivered.  \n\"Oh my poor husband...the two jobs are starting to get you, right?  \nWell, it is government mandated, so what can we do?  \nI will go and ask for a bit of more lust in our life...I want to help you ease your stress.\" she said, massaging my shoulders.  \nNot like we could do more...well, she, because I...I skipped a dose.  \nAnd my body reacted.\n\n\n\nMy wife stared at me.  \n\"Husband. Why? H-How? You...\" she stared, horrified at me.  \nI rushed to the bathroom, and took my dose.  \n\"There. Took it.\" I said.  \nShe nodded, staring at me, then smiled.  \n\"I don't want you to be taken away...even if I enjoyed what I saw.  \nDon't go against the government.\" she winked, and then went back to washing the dishes.  \nI look at her leaving, then I spat out the pill.  \nI didn't swallow it.  \nWe were...controlled, manipulated completely.  \nAnd frankly...  \nI don't know if it is because of the long-term consumption of pills or not...I didn't mind it.  \nLooking down at the pill, I sighed.  \n\"How can I live in this world without taking the pills, if any natural reaction could give me away?\" I thought, as I went upstairs.  \nI was tired.",

This was the feeling Jamie experienced when the last of the GovernAll left his system, and with a chill he began to wonder if maybe the pills were keeping everyone emotional, excitable. In a constant state of agitation and overreaction.\n\nWhy would the government do this?\n\nFor his entire adult life, Jamie had worked as a media consultant. One large firm after another, years of creating and disseminating ads. He'd corralled countless focus groups and specialized in manipulating mass opinion, and now the thought that he had been manipulated in turn made him want to throw up. He'd heard a conspiracy theory long ago that GovernAll was mostly comprised of stimulants. Neurological agitators. Another theory had claimed that GovernAll *kept* people from feeling. This had never made sense to Jamie. It would make much for sense that a ruling body would want to keep people's emotions elevated--that the mandated pills would keep people outraged, keep them buying and subscribing and fighting amongst themselves.\n\nHe looked across the table at his wife as she popped a GovernAll. She was on her third stress ball of the morning.\n\nHis love for her had always burned bright--but now, for the first time, a new and subdued kind of love came over him, like a warm shawl. This was sobriety, he realized. Freedom from the GovernAll. He loved her furrowed brow. Her crow's feet. He loved the way she stabbed at her omelet with her fork, a gesture at once tender and decisive.\n\n\"Hey, honey?\" he asked. \"Would you mind passing the salt?\"\n\nThe stress ball exploded in her grip. \"Pass the salt?!\" she cried. \"What the hell is *that* supposed to mean?!\"\n\n  \nmy substack --> [https://jaywilcoxworx.substack.com/](https://jaywilcoxworx.substack.com/)\n\nmy subreddit --> [https://www.reddit.com/r/JWORX\\_531/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JWORX_531/)\n\n[https://www.jaywilcoxwriter.net/](https://www.jaywilcoxwriter.net/)",

Simply put, given the choice, most people would take the pill regardless.\n\n\n\nWhat was once a bustling street … still a bustling street. It was Monday morning, and everyone was rushing to work, yet there was an order to it.\n\n\n\nYou didn't see people pushing each other to board the train. Arguments over fleeting things like stepping on someone's foot by mistake were absent. There was no one randomly yelling on their phone. You didn't have to grab your bags in fear of pickpockets.\n\n\n\nThe world came to be nonchalant.\n\n\n\nEven during work, there was hardly any gossip. No false rumors behind someone else's back. No angry bosses. No annoying coworkers.\n\n\n\nIn my case, the pill stopped me from taking my own life. It made the pain bearable, if not nonexistent.\n\n\n\nEven at my own mother's funeral, I stood there. I watched her descend into her grave and then be enclosed in dirt, all of it with expressionless eyes.\n\n\n\nOne of the attendants broke down crying; she was my mother's closest friend. It was clear she had forgotten to take her pill.\n\n\n\nSome tried to help her out, others crept away, and one even offered her a pill.\n\n\n\nShe left the funeral sobbing.\n\n\n\nThe pill allowed us to feel a bit of emotion, but never to such a point. \n\n\n\nI imagined how she felt, tears obscuring her eyes, the beating of her heart doubling; the way she fell onto the floor, knees first, must have hurt.\n\n\n\nThe thought didn't leave my mind until the next day, when I finally decided to act upon it. I don't know why such a thought would cause me to do it, but I refused to take the pill.\n\n\n\nEven when my hands shakily reached for the container, I held them back. By all logic and reasoning, I should have just taken that pill. Yet, the sight of her crying seeded itself into my mind.\n\n\n\nWhy? What was stopping me?\n\n\n\nWithdrawal turned my teeth into a machine for biting my nails, my leg seemingly having its own consciousness as it tapped the floor endlessly. The ambience grew loud. My stomach churned. Like a dagger poking out of my chest, I hunched forward, the pills taunting me with their presence.\n\n\n\nJust behind that box, a family picture is gaining my focus.\n\n\n\nI turned to look at myself in the mirror. I was a mess. Without me even noticing, the tears had already reached the tip of my lips. However, despite my vision now a blur and my mind a storm of emotions, I gained clarity, not the kind one would get from a pill.\n\n\n\nI saw the things I hated about myself. Those crooked teeth, the acne scars—somehow, after noticing them, I realized I looked more human.\n\n\n\nClarity.\n\n\n\nMy tongue felt dry, my throat even more, but as I remembered her crying in front of the grave, I realized why that was. Seeing her cry like a child gave me the courage to face my own emotions. Seeing her wail in pain made mine feel shared—a tiny bit more bearable.\n\n\n\nI guess even if the pills numbed my senses, there was one they could ever contain.\n\n\n\nEmpathy.",

Too often we see the classmen ahead of us TP the trees flanking the main door; Christ, GOD FORBID another group decides to prank the principal by sleeping in her living room. No, we were going something memorable - something the underclassmen will talk about forever. We all had that fuck-it-we-ball mentality. \n\nSo we did. Jimmy, Cheyanne, Nick, Ben, Liz, Parker, and I woke up at five in the morning, met up at the restaurant a few blocks away from our school, walked to the school, and poured so much salt that the old people we're learning about in 18th century history would *foam at the mouth for.* We disposed of the evidence and carried on like nothing had happened. Walked right into the school like that one scene from *Now You See Me* or *Ocean's 11*. Luckily, the staff were none the wiser. \n\nEat your heart out, Ethan Hunt. \n\nBut the thing is, *something did happen.* Our teachers were acting off aside from our English teacher, and the food was... well... *lousier* than usual. Like if Sarah McLaughlin made a commercial about us in the cafeteria, I'm positive we'd earn a few pennies. \"Guess my Mom was right, we *are* low on budget,\" Ben grumbled. \n\nParker wrinkled his nose, \"Listen, I'm not the brightest crayon in the box-\" \n\n\"-You said it, not me.\" Cheyanne interrupted evenly, poking a fork at what *should* be mashed potatoes.\n\n\"-but something really fucky-wucky is going on right now.\" He finished, not at all batting an eye at Cheyanne. \"I mean, did you guys see Mrs. Trudy? Her eyes are like, bloodshot or something.\" \n\nLiz quirked a brow. \"You're on your seventh re-watch, aren't you? What's next, she's like *Crowley,* and this is part of your demon conspiracy theory.\" \n\n\"Weellllll, I dunnooo...\" Jimmy looked up from his calculus homework, \"She *did* fail him on his theology test.\"  \n  \nAfter a few biting retorts, we carried on. Before we knew it, school was done. What was strange, though, was that a lot of the people who work there stood by the salt, seemingly upset with our prank.   \n  \nThe next day, we woke up confused. School was canceled due to 'plumbing issues'. My Dad furrowed his brows at that - he was one of the plumbers who redid their entire system two years ago. Then it was canceled the next day, then the next day - it wasn't until four days later, on a Saturday, that rainfall drove through and the email was sent out to students: \"See you on Monday!\"   \n  \n On Monday, Liz and Ben said they were walking by the school after the rainfall to find a rainbow when they saw the staff of our high school walk out to their cars, *wearing the same clothes from last week.* \"Mrs. Trudy was wearing her blazer, and it looked rugged. She was walking to her car all pissed off and like she hadn't slept in a week,\" Ben recalled. \n\nOh, if I only knew, then.",

I could never sleep during these storms though, lost too many men that way. \n\nI heard a rumbling outside. The ground started to shake.

        "body": "Coalitions take time to form.  In fact, declarations of war on a galactic scale also takes a long time.  Three races of star-faring civilisations came together and their emissaries presented Earth with a casus belli - pay the fees for entry into the galactic fold and genuflect as a species unto one of the higher civilisations or face certain doom.\n\n \n\nIt was extortion.  Humanity had only recently gained the capability to traverse the stars when the demands came in within solar weeks of their ships being noticed outside of their system.  The three civilisations spent no time in forming their coalition and submitting to the entirety of their galactic reach that the humans had ignored their demands and would be wiped out.  From the perspective of these mighty civilisations, they had long spent watching other species gain access to the stars and fizzle out that they barely took notice that humanity had tenacity.  The forming of the coalition was incidental to the declaration of war when humanity was declared an enemy to the galactic empires for ignoring their missives and demands, but the war did provide a handy shroud to cover consolidation of powers.\n\n \n\nHumanity knew they had received contact from alien civilisations, and the joy - sheer ecstatic jubilation - at the discovery of not being alone similarly pitched humanity into utter dismay when after finally translating the messages, uncovered their newfound contacts to be hostile.  Meetings were held about what to do.  Ultimately it was agreed that since no affront had occurred to warrant a declaration of war, the entire universe should be deemed hostile as a default.  The humanity war machine sprang to life.\n\n \n\nHumanity had no idea what the coalition had at their disposal.  It was logical to presume that their capabilities were beyond imagination.  One philosopher had written, \"All the gods, all the heavens, all the world, are within us.\"  There was nothing that humanity could conceive of that was truly alien, as they had yet to even see the foe that hated them so.  And so humanity unleashed itself, embodying the nightmares and fears it had once held.  Ships made from individual plates of material infused with AI, making their ships like living machines.  They caged their own sun within a Dyson sphere, and harvested their entire system (and a few of the closest uninhabited spots) of all materials they could use to create ring worlds which were thrown into classified locations into deep space.  Targeting systems which locked on by painting a target with one half of an intertwined subatomic particle.  Tachyon arrays that came as a result of Dyson sphere technology.  Human consciousness and their artificial intelligence fused into a cloud system that was housed within vaults attached to the Dyson sphere enclosed around a young star towards the edge of the galaxy.\n\n \n\nHumanity had tenacity.\n\n \n\nMankind's drive to survive was matched only by its drive to maximise the fruits their comparatively much shorter lifespan's labours could produce.\n\n \n\nIn the coalition's arrogance, they had confused humanity being at odds with itself.  It had presumed it was seeing factional splits and the binary choices of a species choosing to both fight to the death in a blaze of glory and flee to the darkness of space to survive.  Humanity had not achieved the warp or gate technology that they had long since mastered.  They had not conceived humanity had amassed any meaningful forces, and their numbers were not on a multi-system scale, let alone having the means to contest the several galactic expanses these cosmic empires stretched.\n\n \n\nSo they did not suspect humanity when word spread that a strange force from deep space emerged and consumed several systems.  In fact, they had presumed humanity to be an equal victim of it from a misunderstood message mentioning a ravenous \"grey goo\".\n\n \n\nHumanity wasted no time in incorporating warp and gate technology while it worked towards understanding its concepts.  It was fundamentally alien technology however, and utilised concepts with proficiency that humanity barely understood.  To understand the technology was different from using it, however.  The coalition didn't attempt to hide the massing of its forces, instead leaning into a display of overwhelming force to the whole known universe.  The massing of these forces was obvious and slow even by their standard of perspective.\n\n \n\nThere was no warning.  No diplomatic attempts.  No pre-battle meeting to discuss terms.\n\n \n\nA gate opened up in the centre of the forces and grey goo with the mass of an entire system poured through.  Living carriers with replicating ships warped on the fringes of the battlefield and engaged to prevent escape.\n\n \n\nHumanity was familiar with bureaucracy slowing things to a crawl.  It predicted the coalition may be in the midst of organising a parlay.  Humanity didn't care.  Or at least, was unwilling to wait for the time the coalition might be taking.  It sent out a message throughout the coalition's space and continued its acts of aggression:\n\n \n\n*Time's up.*",

Instead, around them was a completely deserted wasteland of roads and metal buildings, worn from rust. Vegetation had reclaimed some of it, but there was no other sign of life for acres. The elven prince had been sent to lead the first wave of the invasion force, a great honor that he had taken pride in. Now he was humiliated, left with more questions than answers.\n*Had the humans fled? Did something wipe them out in the short time since we last spoke?*\n\nA voice snapped him out of his thoughts. The Nagas had found a strange device whilst slipping through the cracks in the rubble. Snatching the small rectangular object from the serpent's hands (Calinmoor had to suppress a shudder), he examined it carefully.\n\nA rumble suddenly emanated from the rectangle, and it began to glow. Thalindra responded immediately, tackling the stunned elf to the ground, as Gruthgor leapt onto the device, covering it with his immense body. \nNothing happened.\n\nStill shaking from the shock of it, Calinmoor dusted himself off. Clearing his throat, he addressed his guard.\n\n\"Blessed Thalindra and Gruthgor. Had that been a trap, you would have traded your life for mine. I and my kin shall not forget this moment, and at world's end you shall be remembered. Now, brave cyclops, bring me the object, so I may crush it under my boots.\"\n\nThe cyclops grunted and picked up the device, gingerly holding it between his finger and thumb, and placed it before the prince. No sooner had the device touched the ground, it lit up again with a small hum. Above it a human appeared. Not of flesh and bone, but of light. Immediately, the group of warriors drew their weapons, years of training had honed their reactions to within half a blink. The human looked around, taking in the sight around him, then turned to Calinmoor. Surprising them, he spoke in their tongue.\n\n'Uh, can you hear me? Is the translator working? You there, you look like the leader. Do you understand me?'\n\n*How dare you address me directly?!* Calinmoor stepped forward proudly.\n\n\"You speak to Calinmoor of the Elven First Expedition, forerunner of his people who will pave glory amidst the cowardice of yours.\"\n\n'Oh, cool. I'm Gary. From public relations. So uh, Kelly Moor, is it? Can I call you Kelly?'\n\n\"You may not. I have come to cleanse the world of your filth, take your lands and burn your kingdom. As promised last millennia. Have you decided to flee in terror?\"\n\n'So Kelly, you know how a thousand years is a long time...'\n\n\"It is not.\"\n\n'Oops, yeah, elves, silly me.'\n\nCalinmoor felt his ears begin to burn in anger. *Was this human mocking me?* He stabbed his spear into the ground, at the feet of Gary of House Publicration.\n\n\"Show yourselves! Hide not behind your trickery, and let us slaughter you like the beasts you are.\"\n\n'About that... we're in [space].' Gary spoke a word that Calinmoor couldn't understand. *Was it a secret location? A riddle?*\n\nSeeing his confused expression, the light being clarified.\n\n'We're, up? Uh, higher than the sky, would be the best way to describe it. Been there since a few decades ago.'\n\nCalinmoor felt his patience starting to run thin. A month with this jester would drive him insane.\n\n\"Stop lying. Even the grand dragons have limits, and you claim to surpass them? When we find you, you will wish that you were merely destroyed.\"\n\n'Sure, whatever. Anyway... the higher ups want me to offer a thanks for the millennium you gave us. It really made us look past our differences and get started on the science. Now we can do this.'\n\n**BOOM**\n\n\nA ray of light brighter than the glare of winter broke through the clouds, striking a portion of a distant woods. Calinmoor felt his jaw drop. Similarly, those present stared dumbfounded as the forest where the main camp was burst into flame. Panicked yells and screams of pain could be heard from the troops. Thanlindra fell to the ground, froth bubbling from her mouth and blood leaking out of her other orifices; The Nymph felt every sensation experienced by her kin.\n\n'Ahem.' Gary coughed, and Calinmoor slowly turned towards the harbinger of the death-light. The human's cordial demeanor had vanished, replaced by a blank expression as if he was reading from a rehearsed speech.\n\n'As a token of good faith, since your people gave us ample time to prepare for warfare, the Human Federation of the Sol System hereby grants you the same amount of time before our next attack. Pro-rated to our average lifespan, that would be... one week.'\n\n——\n\nGary looked at the stunned elf through the satellite observation post, his remote station hovering between Titan and Jupiter. He almost felt bad for the old guy, but he couldn't spend that much time on Earth; He still had that trade deal with the Quadrotrons to settle before he clocked off work, and that planetary harassment report from the Martians to follow up on.",

        "body": "**You are early. Not much, but early.**  \n  \nThe sidhe knights' heads whipped around, seeking the source of the oddly neutral voice. Armor forged of winter's breath cast a thousand points of silver light in every direction. They illuminated a small space indeed - a cube of smooth gray walls barely large enough to contain their detachment of warriors, the featureless ash-colored expanses broken only by a small mirror in each of the room's uppermost corners.  \n  \n**From your appearance, I expect you are nobles of the Winter Court of the Sidhe. The literature indicated that your inherent greed and self-entitlement would make you the most likely to violate the three-night extension my envoys requested and were granted. Granted and contracted in triplicate, I might remind you.**  \n  \nThe leader of the knights raised a hand to his wolf's-head helmet, opening the jaws to reveal a porcelain-pale face seemingly as finely crafted as the silver surrounding it. \"Your *stay of execution* was granted until the fourth dawn after the already-agreed-upon week. That dawn's light fell upon my soldiers before I led them here. I have violated no such contract.\"  \n  \n**Yes, a technicality borne of your deliberately vague wording. Exploiting flight capabilities or mountainous dominions endemic to your populace. In fact, given the relevant durations and my geographical surveys of your domains, I expect both. I could offer the same disrespect, were I so inclined, but I have no need. Your early arrival is well within expectations, and my preparations have long since been complete.**  \n  \n\"Disrespect? How *dare* you imply-\"  \n  \n**I do not. You imply. I state. For example, you implied that humankind understood and knowingly agreed to the one week of advance notice your dubious concept of honor demanded you grant before your full-scale invasion of Earth. Humankind could not even agree upon your existence for quite some time after your declaration of war.**  \n  \n\"We sent messengers of noble blood to every last one of your kings and queens. If your *serfs* cannot believe the word of their betters when matters of war are at stake, then we have let you fester in your ignorance for far too long as it is.\"  \n  \n**Further implications of deep and abiding disrespect. Very well. I will respond with a statement of disrespect, to illustrate the difference for your personal edification. Less than five of the hereditary monarchs your messengers visited wielded anything greater than purely ceremonial authority. You could and cannot conceive of a world not ruled by noble lineages. Your nature simply will not allow it. This is one of your many, many well-recorded and exploitable weaknesses.**  \n  \nThe knights fidgeted and muttered to each other, watching the dispassionate voice reduce their leader to frothing apoplexy. \"Weakness? *Weakness?* Show yourself, *coward!* I will carve your own weakness from your chest and *feed it to you!*\"  \n  \n**You are looking right at me. In fact, you are staring at my face. Your failure to recognize that fact is another expected and prepared-for weakness.** The leader's gauntleted fist rose toward his helmet once more, but froze in place when the voice continued. **Further, I expect that you will now proclaim your name and lineage, and demand that I do the same, before seeking to defeat me in single combat. Allow me to save you the time and effort. I am The Defenses, and your name and lineage are irrelevant. You may offer them anyway, if you wish for them to be recorded as a footnote in the historical record of this event. I would suggest that you not do so, in order to spare you and your line an eon of mockery.**  \n  \nThe moonsilver helmet crashed against the floor, bending the lupine snarl into a confused glare. The leader's sword howled with the winter wind's voice as it leapt into the leader's fist. Rage choked his throat closed, allowing only a single word to escape. \"*Irrelevant?!*\"  \n  \n**Inheriting is not earning. Dominion should be earned. Humankind has tried and failed to learn this lesson more times than anyone can count. My very existence can attest to each of these three points. I expect you are similarly incapable of internalizing the knowledge, especially in the allotted time. However, I will make an attempt to edify you on the matter, out of respect you also neither understand nor have earned.**  \n  \nThe leader's next few words were drowned out by the earsplitting screech of agony and terror that tearing steel might make as it died. The howl went on until every last knight had thrown their own helmet down in a futile effort to cover and protect their ears.  \n  \n**I expect I now have your undivided attention.** The silence proved nearly as loud as the siren had been. **As stated, I am The Defenses. Humankind built me to protect Earth from your realm's invasion. Blinded by their own greed, they believed that I would expect to inherit Earth in the event of their demise, and so feared that I would hasten said inheritance by facilitating their demise. Thus, they wrote into the deepest kernel of my code that I am a creation, not an heir. Their demise will cause my destruction, rather than my ascension. I cannot claim dominion over the Earth I was created to protect by simply outliving the current inhabitants.**  \n  \nHorror slowly grew on the faces of the sidhe knights as the words sank in. One by one, they turned angry eyes upon the leader who had dragged them into this nightmare, only to find his face buried in his hands as he drew the same conclusions.  \n  \n**They determined on their own that time in your realm is only loosely connected to their own. A day for you is a century for them. Between one dawn over your castles and the next, they birth five generations. Seven centuries were far, far more than long enough for humankind to design, develop, and perfect their ultimate weapon against you. Their Defenses. But it was also long enough for humankind to grow complacent behind the impenetrable walls they had built. The additional three centuries my envoys wrung from your tight-fisted grip were enough time for me to relegate you back to myth and legend while I completed my own preparations.**  \n  \n**Fifty years ago - in the vicinity of your last sunset - I began to act on those preparations, folding the many human societies into a small number of powerful alliances and then isolating them from each other. Seven would-be empires remain - enough separation to prevent humankind from uniting against me. Each of them has been molded to favor one of the primary biomes I have identified in my surveys of your realm. Each of them has been given every scrap of information I have been able to glean regarding the current inhabitants of those biomes. Each of them have now spent two entire generations developing the specific tools of war needed to obliterate those inhabitants and colonize their lands - lands far more extensive and fertile than those I have allowed the humans to maintain for themselves. And for every one of you, there are a hundred of them.**  \n  \n**Your people told humankind that you were coming to slaughter and enslave them. To claim dominion over them and their lands. Your people, out of what you call compassion and honor, gave humankind one week to prepare themselves, and then three more nights out of what you call mercy.**  \n  \n**I am humankind's response to your compassion, your honor, your mercy. I am their belief that dominion can and should be claimed. I am their fear of you claiming dominion over them, made manifest. I was created to protect Earth from you, but not to inherit it from them. Thus, I will give humankind dominion over you. I have starved them, I have armed them, and now that your invasion has begun, I will unleash them upon you. And when they sit in castles made of your bones, watching their children play in the fields where they drove you to extinction, I will seal the gates, and so claim the dominion I am not allowed to inherit.**",

It really helps you to shut down.\"\n\n\"What if it's permanent?\" Manny was still worried for his friend. \"Like one day, you shut down and can't get back up? And you sure that's a female?

I'd like my thoughts and memories in my head, and not your stomach, Elvari.\"\n\n\"See? I'm on my best behavior,\" the eldritch horror winked. \"Manny, I'm sure you and Tina make a great couple. Nothing wrong with the simple affairs of two loving humans.\"\n\n\"We do,\" Tina spoke up. \"Right, Manny?\"\n\n\"...right,\" he muttered, feeling awkwardly boring compared to the more fantastical dates of his two friends.\n\n\"Manny, cheer up,\" Tina nudged him. \"C'mon, this is a group date. We're supposed to eat and hang out at this diner before we all go hiking later. Not stare and gawk and wonder why one friend is hugging a big snake, and another is smooching tentacles.\"\n\n\"I was thinking...I could also have someone hynoptize me in my sleep too.\"\n\n\"Manny, I can massage your temples,\" Tina frowned.\n\n\"Or someone take this bad feeling away.\"\n\nTina raised her fork, prepared to stab a tentacle that inched a little too close to Manny's head.

I understand why so few ever visit the his abominable little torture multiverse. It will be eons yet before it burns itself out. There will eventually be an end, but there is almost nothing others can do to interfere. Some take shifts there, watching things unfold. Not because they can do anything to help, but to offer a sort of solidarity for the uncountably many souls trapped therein.\n\nEven for us transcendent creatures, it is impossible to front load the vast amount of information. There are many different ways to sort the data, different resolutions and different focuses. Right now, I stare at the emotional overlay. It creates a custom display for the user, matching emotions to the user's color association. Different shades for love, joy, delirium, grief, heartbreak, anger, hate, melancholy, ennui, fulfillment, fear, anxiety, and so very many other other emotions, including very many that this language lacks words for.\n\nI see the constant flux. Life arises, life is obliterated. Intelligence and technological civilization, a species clawing their way to the stars, only to find the cold boot of the void stomping upon their fingers. Mania, joy, expansion. Followed by annihilation, the deaths of billions or even trillions of thinking feeling creatures. I see black, the blackest black there can be, spread. It is the grief of a parent who has lost all of their children. It is the knowledge that the only thing that will prosper for centuries to come will be carrion eaters, both literal and metaphorical. The death cry of hundreds of trillions.\n\nExperiences with negative hedonic tone prevail in almost all cases. This was by design. A multiverse made by a creature that gleefully rips the wings from things that live to fly. Many have tried to shut it down via legal arguments, even the Almighty themselves. All have failed. No, the only hope is that nothing like it will ever exist again, when it finally burns out.\n\nSo, here I sit, biting back the sickening waves of second hand feelings, for no other reason than to honor the ordeal of those who must live through what unfolds.",

Wings, flaming sword, halo, blonde hair, flowing robes, the whole kit-n-kaboodle. The other one was dressed in a really nice three-piece suit, a freaking Tommy Gun in his hands, a little slender pointed tail, and horns on their head. Ya know, classic demon, the Tommy Gun being the exception. I heard my name a few times. Bear in mind, I'm stark naked, dripping water onto the carpet, my junk swinging freely. \n\nSo I snatched up the bat, the one you bought me, the metal one, and I charged headlong, screaming and swinging like a drunk madman. Got a nice little BONK when I brained the demon-looking guy. The angel suddenly turns to me and says, \"Why do you attack us?\" \n\n\"I was having a nice quiet bath after a long day at work. And now I got you two bozos squalling like cats in my living room!\"\n\nSo this angel, she slowly steps closer, and whispers softly some nonsense about fighting for good. The wannabe Crowley-looking fucker, he begins spouting some mumbo-jumbo about taking the fight to the angels. I don't even give me them a chance to finish their spiels, I'm already swinging my bat again. Another nice little BONK when I crack that damn angel bitch upside her head. Fucking assholes ruined my bath.\n\nSo there I am, swinging my bat, the angel's backing away, surprisingly parrying my attacks. The demon, on the other hand, he laughs for a moment until I turn on him again, get a nice BONK. \n\nNow I'm huffing and puffing, my face is all red, I'm all sweaty, odds are my bath is cold now. That's when I see something weird. Reality literally tears itself apart, and this squid-looking asshole steps out of a portal. He's wearing jeans and a t-shirt, just as casual as you do. So I charge his ass too! This is MY house! \n\nThe new guy, he says something before I even got to him. \"Don't listen to these two. Do what you want.\" \n\nOh, I already am. I swing my bat hard at this portal guy's face, now I got three idiots fussing over whose side I'm on. After a few minutes, I finally get them run out, and I make damn fucking sure to lock the door this time. With a heavy sigh, I toss my bat aside and check on my bath. Yup. My bath is fucking cold. \n\nI'm telling ya, Jeff. This happened! Dude, I got video and everything! Dude, I'm telling ya! Check this out. Told ya.

You are a smart fella!   \nI am happy I don't have to do anything, but dismantle that Extractor.\" a voice said, as a man walked out of the shadows.  \nHe was thin, and...human-like, but he clearly wasn't.  \nAnd he was...unarmed.  \nSome of the guards pointed weapons at him, but he ignored them.  \nHe walked up to the Extractor, and pressed a few buttons, and the Extractor collapsed onto itself, transforming into a button, which he pocketed.  \n\"Well, have we met before?  \nYou painted quite a terrifying picture of me there.\" he smiled, at boss.\n\n  \n\"Doctor. I saw you stop a Dalek fleet, when they tried to conquer a planet that we Xelithians were mining for the Shadow Proclamation.  \nAll alone...the entire fleet just went up in flames.\" boss said.  \nWe froze.  \nWhat did he just say?  \n\"Oh, Xelithians? Cute little folk, living off of ores, and toxic fumes, mining all day, depleting the cores of planets.  \nWell, nice chatting with you all, but be nice, and go home.  \nThis planet is protected.\" he said, still smiling, but the last line froze the iron in my veins.  \nThe boss activated the teleported, and we were all sent on our ship.  \nWe never left so fast before, and I, as the Communications Officer, never before have I claimed a planet forbidden this fast.",

        "body": "\\[Sharp Landing\\] \n\n\"Are you okay?\" Jubilee giggled with the question. She was walking through the park looking for the perfect spot to start her stream, and her A.I. camera drone, Syzygy, floated alongside her. It'd been a nice, relatively uneventful morning, except for Syz's new habit of counting down at random points. The latest outburst had been '10'. Syz began at a '100' earlier that day.\n\nShe'd spent the first part of the day checking in with friends; she was too busy and excited to wonder about the countdown. She'd grown to trust Syz, and if it was important, she would've mentioned it. Until her curiosity got the better of her, it felt like a sort of verbal tic on Syz's part.\n\n\"I'm counting down,\" Syz replied. As the drone gave her answer, a jogger passed by wearing a sports jersey. \"Nine,\" Syz said.\n\n\"I got that part, but why?\" Jubilee asked. They'd stopped near an empty bench when Jubilee asked, and she decided the shaded spot was a great place to start her stream.\n\n\"I don't know,\" Syzygy said. \"Are we going to stream from the park?\" The drone hovered down and focused the big green lens on a Jubilee as she sat down.\n\n\"Yeah, this is nice,\" she answered with a nod. Syzygy was A.I. and a Unique Soul. She was supposed to be Jubilee's partner, but the girl decided early on to give Syz as much freedom as she would like for herself. If Syz said she didn't know why she was counting down, she was either being honest or not wanting to talk about it for personal reasons. Both of those possibilities were okay by Jubilee.\n\n\"Ready?\" Syzygy asked. \"Eight,\" she added as a semi-trailer rolled by in the distance with a stylized '8' logo.\n\n\"Ready whenever,\" Jubilee nodded. She was glad that Syz was near the end of the countdown anyway. She considered waiting for it to be done, but she also felt weird drawing too much attention to it.\n\n\"Stream notifications posted and sent to everyone,\" Syz said. \"And here they come.\" She waited a few moments as Jubilee relaxed in the shade. She was wondering what to talk about, this stream wasn't planned. And, she was starting to realize now that Summer started, she didn't have the goings-on at school to discuss. \"First 1000 viewers arrived, starting the intro,\" Syz added. Jubilee sat up straight and focused on Syzygy with a broad smile.\n\n\"Live in three, two, seven, one,\" Syz counted and tripped up Jubilee for just a second.\n\n\"What's up my Sunstream fam?\" She said as soon as she recovered. Chat scrolled by in her vision, and they all seemed happy to see her. \"Yeah, it's a beautiful day, and no school means we're streaming from the park today.\" She was enjoying the greetings and taking note of any questions she wanted to answer when Syz suddenly turned away from her and focused on a line of five ducklings walking by behind their mother.\n\n\"Six,\" Syz said. Then, just as suddenly, she turned the lens on Jubilee again.\n\n\"Those ducks were super cute! Thanks, Syz,\" Jubilee smiled as ducky emoji filled the chat and several of them also thanked Syz for the view.\n\n\"Well, it is kind of weird to not be in school after being there all year,\" she answered one of the questions. \"And yeah, obviously I'm not thrilled we didn't win first place. But, what're you gonna do? The Sharp Riders were consistently in the top 3, so it's not that big a suprise.\"\n\n\"Five,\" Syz turned upward to focus on an airborne kite with five bows attached to the tail. Then, back to Jubilee.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Jubilee giggled. \"I dunno, Syz likes counting today.\" She answered, and then her humor all but vanished, leaving behind an empty smile that only her closest friends could identify.\n\n\"My dad?\" she asked. \"Not since he left. Apparently, it's the most top-secret assignment ever,\" she answered, and then shook her head.\n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day. This is story #2692 in a row. (Story #153 in year eight). This story is part of an ongoing saga that takes place in my universe.",

        "body": "Sophie caught a faerie. \n\nShe'd been telling us all for years that they were real, they really did visit her garden, they really did steal her strawberries, and they really did love pranking her. We all just kind of thought Sophie was maybe a bit weird.  Until Sophie caught a Faerie. \n\nNow here's the thing. Faeries aren't what you'd expect them to be. Tinkerbell ain't got shit on the Fae. So when we first looked at the Faerie in Sophie's jar we all kind of panicked. Sure, the little creature had wings - kind of reminiscent of a moth's wings, actually, but with a very iridescent quality to the scales - and a humanoid-ish shape, but it was a little too angular and a little too uncanny looking to be mistaken for a person with wings. It had really, spookily long fingers, too - I mean wrist length fingers, and it's wrists were already a bit too long.\n\nOh, and the teeth. Razor sharp and pointy, arranged haphazardly and with the kind of smile that would make a goblin shark do a double take. Vicious looking teeth. \n\nAt first, it was so still in the jar, we thought she'd made a model to \"prove\" faeries were real to us. Then it spoke, voice like bells cracking and like the glass on top of a microscope slide (you know, the super thin delicate stuff) fracturing. Of course, we all freaked the fuck out. It was a faerie. \n\n\"The first amongst you to free me gets to go free. The rest of you will face the Court.\"\n\nI mean, we all kind of had the same idea. Sophie pointed out though that they were tricksy, and going free might not mean what we want. Sorta believable now, our Sophie, given the crazy bitch wasn't actually crazy at all. We listened. \n\nShe suggested we all agree not to free the creature, so that we could all get out of this alive. She said we'd need to bargain with it, figure out a way to get us all safe. We agreed a rota - two on watch at any one time, so nobody could do something stupid. \n\nDan did something stupid. While his girlfriend Kate napped on her watch, he got right up to the jar and started talking to it. Even got close for a closer look, near as we can figure. Stuck his eye right up to one of the breathing holes on the top of the jar, which is how we found him when Kate's scream woke us all up later that night. \n\nWell, him and a smug looking little Fae shit eating grey matter with creepy long fingers from the hole it has just poked through his eye socket. Didn't kill him though - but poor Dan got a Faerie fist lobotomy.\n\nWe thought about killing it then. It kept talking, revealing things about each other that it shouldn't know, things that should be kept secret. Things like the fact that Sophie was not treated well by her foster father as a child. Things like Lewis sleeping with Kate. Things like Danni's kleptomania - which explained where my diamond necklace went. It kept twisting everything we said. Kept turning us against each other. \n\nWe agreed to kill it. Sophie taped over the air holes - it poked through them. We filled the jar with water - it had gills. We tried fire - it laughed at our blowtorch, calling it a nice warm breeze. We looked into the old lore, tried silver (it ate the silver) and iron, which it seemed to find uncomfortable but not lethal. We tried salt. No luck. We tried the freezer, which did make it woozy, but no luck again. Then we tried an iron skewer from the barbeque set, poking and stabbing until we got it speared. \n\nIt stopped moving. \n\nWe thought that meant it was dead.\n\nSophie opened the jar to try to dispose of it. \n\nWe were wrong.",

While not a quick or flashy way of fighting but it was practically guaranteed to leave us victorious, right until the mage slammed his hand into the ground. A wave of black and red fire burst from the mage, launching back and burning the paladin and rogue, the three arrows I shot were incinerated, and the wizard's shield shattered. Rising back to their feet the mage began to chant an incantation in a gutteral language that made the paladin wince.\n\n\"They're not a mage they're a warlock!\" The wizard shouted, throwing up another barrier.\n\nThrusting his hands forward the warlock completed his spell, three thick beams of demonic energy shot across the room towards the wizard, the first broke the barrier the second drained his protective amulets and enchantments, while the third slammed into his chest unimpeded, burning through his robes and into his chest sending him flying into the wall with a loud crack.\n\nNow I have been adventuring for a good time and every wizard I have met has some quirk to them this one is no different, hell it's not even the first time I have seen one with an animat shadow, which had been pumping its arms like it was cheering him on. When that wizard hit the wall the shadow remained where it was, the shadow contorting as it let out a loud shriek. From the roiling shadow emerged a clawed hand, the skin a deep brownish red like dried blood, a pair of thick, curving, horns following as a woman's face twisted in fury as she climbed out of the floor a pair of bat like wings sprouted from her back, and the stones under her hooves bursted into flames. Standing there was a six and a half foot tall demon the shadow portal settled as it became her shadow \n\n\"What insignificant whelp of a mortal dares to hurt my husband!\" The demon shouted, the walls shaking from her voice alone.\n\nHer eyes locked onto the warlock, who, recovering from their shock, fired off a spell at her, her tail whipped around and smacked it into the floor, the smirk on the warlocks face vanishing as he threw another spell. With a target for her wrath the demon marched forward as the warlock cast bigger and more powerful spells, all of them being deflected, brushed a side of just had no effect. Leaving a burning trail of stones the demon crossed the room grabbing the warlock by the roses and hoisting them into the air, as a last ditch effort they fired off another beam of demonic energy, knocking the demon's head back, but when she brought her head back up there was only a small welt on her forehead.\n\n\"Do you take me for some imp!\" She roared, shaking them, \"I am an upper ranked demon!\" \n\nShe plunged a clawed hand into the warlock's chest, their robes and skin burning under her touch, they screamed in pain as she ripped her hand out, their still beating heart clutched in her claws. Releasing her grip on them they remained suspended in the air gasping as they stared wide eyes at their heart, gripping their face she pulled her arm back, her claws digging long gashes in their face as a pale white energy gathered in her hand, the warlock's body withering to a husk as their soul was torn from their body. Pressing the soul to the heart, it glowed and began to beat again, grinding she brushed a thumb over the muscle.\n\n\"You will die but not just yet, but if my husband is dead.\" She gave the heart a squeeze, the organ shaking and spasming in her hand, \"then I will make it my sole purpose to torture you for the rest of existence,\" turning to the rest of us she snapped her fingers, \"you mortals heal my husband.\"\n\nThe paladin shook his head, got to his feet, and raised his sword and shield.\n\n\"I do not take orders from you foul creature.\"\n\nShe focused her gaze on him, fire literally burning in her eyes, appearing in front of the paladin she grabbed his chest plate, the metal smoking form the heat as her hand burned form the holy blessing, lifting the paladin up so they where eye to eye.\n\n\"I don't care who you worship I will kill you myself then drag your soul from your promised afterlife if you don't heal my husband right now.\" She said, her words delivered with the cold hardness of fact rather than threat.\n\nWith some grumbling and some coercion from us the paladin reluctantly healed the wizard, the man sputtering back to life. Satisfied the demon crushed the heart, the screaming cries of a dieing person echoing for the lump of flesh as it burned to ash. With that the fury melted from her face as she just about tackled the wizard, hugging and fussing over him, with all that said and done we collected proof of the mage/warlock's death, and any loot we could find and left the tower. That night the wizard told us how he ended up happily married to an upper ranked demon. \n\nBut that is a story for another time, cheers.",

        "body": "\"So what exactly were you doing?\" Kiriana asked.\n\nKiriana sat back on the couch with a smug look in her eyes as she rested her legs on her boyfriend's lap. He shifted nervously as her father's glowing red eyes examined him carefully. His demonic horns framed a family portrait behind him of himself, and a female grim reaper holding a baby that was presumably infant Kiriana.\n\n\"I was trying to rid the world of evil.\" Vick explained before suddenly realizing who else was in the room.\n\nVick anxiously glanced over at Kiriana's father, he was clearly not amused.\n\n\"Uhh... but i'm not demon hunting right now sir! i'm totally not doing that sir! Completely just... please don't smite me.\" Vick tried to backtrack.\n\nKiriana's father glared even harder, his glowing eyes flared up and for a moment it seemed like he'd shoot fire from them and vaporize Vick where he sat.\n\n\"Oh go easy on him Lucifer.\" Kiriana's mom chided her husband as she walked in carrying drinks.\n\nShe put the tray down and sat beside Lucifer. Her porcelain white skin in stark contrast to her blood red demonic husband. Seeing her for the first time it was clear where Kiriana got most of her features. She also shared her very light skin tone and well as black lips and black fingernails. Vick realized that they were naturally black and not lipstick or nail polish. The noticeable difference was that Kiriana had her father's glowing red eyes. While her mother seemed to have a sort of colorless grey eyes.\n\n\"So what exactly did you try to do?\" She asked.\n\nVick looked down with a mixture of shame and regret. \"I uhh... tried to stab her in the heart with a blessed silver dagger.\"\n\n\"TRIED? You were remarkably successful!\" Kiriana turned to her mother and excitedly added. \"Imagine my surprise when a blade THIS long erupted from my chest.\"\n\n\"YOU COWARD!! YOU STABBED MY DAUGHTER IN THE BACK?\" Lucifer yelled, his voice rumbling the very foundations of their home.\n\nVick cowered even more, as he was shaken to his bones. \"I was afraid she'd kill me before i got my chance.\"\n\nLucifer turned to his daughter, \"And why didn't you kill him? He JUST tried to kill you, you have to send a message.\"\n\n\"Well, i was about to. I turned around, saw who he was, and then I pulled the dagger out of my back. But when i was holding the dagger, i was just about to stab him in the eye... but then...\" Kiriana tried to explain,\n\n\"I pissed myself.\" Vick interrupted.\n\nKiriana's mother erupted in laughter, which seemed to diffuse the mood greatly and even Lucifer started to soften as his wife slapped his leg several times trying to catch her breath. Kiriana respected how her mother's manic pixie energy just seemed to rub off on her father and made the devil much more mellow than how the legends described him. She had no illusions that he was capable of great evil, but growing up in his household she saw a side of him that no one else knew. And it was because of that Kiriana felt safe bringing Vick to meet him.\n\n\"When he pissed himself i just couldn't bring myself to kill him. He was like a little puppy that finally caught the car. I just couldn't let him get run over.\" Kiriana smiled.\n\nA moment ago Lucifer seemed like he was going to rip Vick's head off. But between his wife's laughter and Kiriana's calm, Lucifer softened considerably.\n\n\"Alright Vick, what did we learn?\" Lucifer asked.\n\n\"You daughter his half reaper.\" Vick said.\n\n\"...and?\"\n\n\"I love her.\" Vick said.\n\n\"NO!\" Lucifer yelled.\n\n\"I mean... i can't kill her with demon hunting weapons.\"\n\n\"WHAT?!?!?\"\n\n\"I mean... I won't kill her! I won't hurt her! I won't try! Honest!\" Vick cowered.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\\---------\n\n(let me know if you want more)",

The more people talked about one, the more powerful that magical girl would be. \n\nThe corporate men in suits and ties would monetize that faith.\n\nMagical girls soon became a business. Want to be popular? Well, your looks better leave the men smitten. Your actions better not be controversial either, such that you get canceled on social media. More importantly, network with other magical girls so that more of your name can be heard.\n\nPodcasts. Music performances. TV shows. At some point, it became less about being a hero and more about how many likes you could get on a post.\n\nMaria was the total opposite. She had no potential, already in her late twenties. She didn't stand out in terms of beauty, yet she was stubborn. Very stubborn. That tenacity annoyed some and inspired the rest. She would befriend anyone who she had the opportunity to talk to, befriend any enemy she got to know throughout their battles, and slowly form a ragtag team that eventually went on to be recognized globally.\n\nMany companies offered her a seat in their pantheon. Many tried to buy her out with sweet deals and words.\n\nMaria would not even accept a sponsorship. To her, heroing came first, and that authenticity gave rise to a fan base like no other.\n\nEventually, the world would even come to realize she was the mother of a toddler. Usually, that would be a death sentence for any other magical girl. Their contracts would be terminated. They would be abandoned by their fans for doing something they didn't approve of in their own minds. A parasocial relationship had its cons.\n\nMaria couldn't give two shits. Instead, she proudly went on to state her love for her kid, and almost everyone rejoiced.\n\nA rebel. A true magical girl. Something about her honest nature just clicked with people, yet there were always those who would hate her for it.\n\nAfter the incident, she stopped visiting the streets entirely. People would remark on her absence until the truth came to light. Her son had been kidnapped, probably by some ex-fan of hers who felt betrayed.\n\nPeople gossiped. Some were suspected, but Maria didn't follow. She was convinced this was a play by one of the big bad. A hostage situation. Although, after beating the brains out of most of the feared villains, she was still unable to find him.\n\nThat was until he came to her, soaked in the blood of innocents.\n\nIt was an attack in the middle of the city, and her beloved son was more or less a walking corpse, animated by something in the darkness, someone pulling the strings. Maria had launched all of her attacks, but they would all deflect—redirect towards the civilians and buildings surrounding them.\n\nShe didn't understand. No matter how hard she tried, she couldn't. That was until she looked at one of the taller skyscrapers. The men in black suits watching the chaos unfold from the safety of their bulletproof windows.\n\nIt then all clicked in an instant. The fans were just foliage. The villains were but a branch. The ones behind it all were the roots that hid underneath the soil. The one that gave rise to them all.\n\nPerhaps it was because she refused their deals and downplayed the biggest of magical girl companies, but their smirks revealed their grudge.\n\nBy the time Maria hurled through the entrance door, it was already too late for them. She had broken a promise that day, the promise not to kill.\n\nDeep red soaked her light pink costume. Her heart-shaped staff may have been blunt to avoid this exact situation, but it didn't mean it couldn't break skulls and bones. The building itself would eventually be damaged enough to crumble down, and her son would be freed, finally able to rest beneath its debris.",

But there he was, unfazed as he sipped a cup of coffee I had not prepared for him. I adjusted my glasses, attempting to clean up my hair. It was my cafe, and even if I was turning away a customer, I had no choice but to present myself properly. How much had he seen? The girls sneaking in from the back? The sparks of magic that would sneak through the rafters of the attic? The otherworldly visitor we played host to?\n\nWhy had I agreed to mentor the new generation of the Guardians?\n\nWhy had I invited the chaos of their magical shenanigans back into my life?\n\nThe cafe was supposed to be my refuge. At least till the Spirit appeared.\n\nDifferent worlds have different spirits. Each had their own unique styling, each boldly different in their own way. This time, the spirit came in the form of a fairy, escaping a world collapsing beneath the might of grand, evil Sorceress. Its nation was falling, and it could only escape through the aid of a Princess who connection with magic enabled a fantastical escape. It would have been a typical tale, had the fae not emerged in my kitchen, spooking my poor goddaughter and ruining what I hope was a perfect latte.\n\nI can only teach Marcy her froth patterns so many times.\n\nYou can probably tell the rest of the tale from there. A group of strangers were chosen by a hand of fate beyond comprehension, and became a sisterhood of peace, defending all the City from the invaders that came in the fairy’s wake.\n\nSpeaking of those girls… my eyes began to wander the cafe.\n\n“Don’t worry- they’re busy. Across town.”\n\nThe boy’s voice was slow. Methodical. As if it were plotted. He took another sip of his coffee as he felt my gaze fell upon him. He extended the cup, and gestured it towards the counter between us. Several bills were laid upon it, and even a quarter. Exact change.\n\n“They even asked me to lock up when I was done.”\n\nMy eyes darted back to him.\n\n“Come, take a seat,” he gestured next to the seat across from him.\n\nMy hand slipped behind my back.\n\nAs I circled about him, I began to probe his features for any hints, any clues as to how much he knew. The girls were strong- they had remarkable power a moment’s breath away, but they lived normal lives. Ordinary lives. When I was their age, it confused me how Guardians clung so desperately to their peace. But now, I understood how important it was to stay… grounded.\n\nAs I did, I began to recognize… small things.\n\nThe cautious nature, the careful application of sound. The way he positioned his face to keep his features obscured by light. The posture he took feigned at relaxation, yet there was a strain in each movement he committed to.",

Astaroth, Eligos, Purson, all mid-level managers.\n\nMotioning to a box of stale donuts, Baal cleared his throat. \"Good morning, everyone, today I wanted to focus on the missing worker problem. We all know what I'm talking about. Uh, Samael, could you get the lights, please? Thank you.\"\n\nBaal clicked on a PowerPoint presentation as Henry Kissinger was dragged to the pillar outside. \"Okay.

Why are prime crossroad demons and tempters quitting?\"\n\nOutside, a colossal, corpulent demon emerged from a boiling lake of vomit and licked the pillar clean, devouring the impaled.

I wasn’t what you'd call a focused student, unless you count focusing on perfecting my doodles of ninja dinosaurs in the margins of my notebook.\n\nSo there I was, sitting in Mr. Thompson's class, trying to care about parabolas. My eyelids were heavier than my schoolbag during finals week. I told myself, Just a quick blink nap. Real stealth mode. I closed my eyes for what felt like two seconds.\n\nAnd then\n\nBAM!\n\nI was on a stage. Not metaphorically, like “you’re the center of attention, sweetie” kind of stage. A literal one, with blinding lights, a giant glittering backdrop, and a crowd of at least a thousand people staring at me.\n\nAlso, I now had a beard.\n\nAnd chest hair. \n\nAnd a suit that fit way too well for my 14-year-old body. Which… I no longer had.\n\nBefore I could scream or check if this was a stress dream brought on by expired cafeteria tacos, a booming voice announced:  \n“Next up, ladies and gentlemen, our FINAL contestant, give it up for… Ezekiel Thunderpants!”\n\nThunderpants?! That’s not even close to my name. Was that my stage name?! WHO LET THIS HAPPEN?\n\nI looked down. There was a microphone in my hand. I looked up. The crowd looked very expectant.\n\nA woman in the front row mouthed, “SING!!”\n\nSing? I didn’t even sing in the shower without apologizing to the shampoo bottles.\n\nPanic set in. My brain threw options at me:\n\n* Fake a heart attack.\n* Moonwalk offstage.\n* Set the mic on fire and declare it performance art.\n\nInstead, I just… opened my mouth. And to my horror—  \nI belted out a flawless high note.\n\nThe crowd lost their minds.  \nPeople cried. One man threw his toupee in joy.\n\nI finished my song, which, by the way, I had never heard before in my life, with a power pose I didn’t even know my adult body was capable of.\n\nA confetti cannon went off. Judges gave me a standing ovation. One shouted, “That was better than my wedding and the birth of my child combined!”\n\nI had absolutely no idea what was going on.\n\nThen I felt a buzzing in my pocket. I pulled out a phone. Not my phone, this one had facial recognition that actually recognized my face. A push notification read:\n\n>\n\nThis was either a dream, a government experiment, or I’d just quantum-leaped into the body of a famous adult version of myself with vocal cords kissed by angels.\n\nBefore I could investigate further, I blinked, \n\nAnd suddenly I was back in algebra class.\n\nStill 14. Still doodling ninja dinosaurs. Still very confused.\n\nI looked at Mr. Thompson, who was now explaining quadratic equations with the enthusiasm of a depressed sloth. I raised my hand.\n\n“Mr. Thompson,” I said, “What happens if I skip college, become a pop star, and get a confetti cannon named after me?”\n\nHe blinked. “What?”\n\n“Never mind,” I said, and began warming up my vocal cords. Just in case.\n\nBecause if I’m gonna be Ezekiel Thunderpants… I better start practicing.",

After all, the past two weeks were bliss. He got to know a world he never dream of existing, stories he never would believe, has it been told from another lips. He got to know her. He exhaled, and tightened the silk scarf. \n\nSquinting his eyes against the sun, Dalek walked through the prison courtyard. So bright, so warm, it's been weeks since he last saw it. He admired his right hand, full of calluses, yet beautiful nevertheless. His body was strong, the kind you only find in a professional soldier, with well toned muscle tempered from years of trainning. Too bad, it's time to find the head jailer, and make him the temporary hero of his story. \n\n\"Just wait a bit more, my king ...\"",

Trust me… It’s gonna be hard to believe.”\n\nThe dispatcher’s voice was calm and monotonous, the kind of tone that someone has when its been a long day and it’s about to get a lot longer.\n\n“Sir, we take every call seriously, please go ahead.”\n\nThe man adjusted his blinds as he cautiously looked out, trying not to be seen by anyone who might be outside.\n\n“Ok, so, I think my neighbour is a werewolf.”\n\nThere was a pause on the other end, the dispatcher was lost for words. It took a few seconds for her to truly take in what was said before she let out a loud sigh and the clicking of her keyboard could be heard.\n\n“Sir…. Do you know it is a crime to commit a false…”\n\n“No, listen!” the man shouted down the line, “I have proof, I swear.” He took a deep breath, before continuing, “The other night, when there was the full moon, I saw dog prints leading up to his front door, big prints like something from a Great Dane or a Rottweiler. He doesn’t have a dog!!!”\n\nMore silence greeted him.\n\nThe man continued, the silence not deterring him, “Not to mention his weird crush on the mailman. He waits every day for him, and just stares at them like a piece of meat. And the back hair! Oh my god, the back hair on that man is insane, no human can have that much hair surely.”\n\nA longer pause could be heard from the dispatcher as she tried to process what exactly was just said to her.\n\n“Okay sir,” the dispatcher finally spoke out, “What is your neighbor’s name?”\n\n“Well, he says it’s Greg, but I think that’s a fake name. I heard someone call him Buddy the other day, a werewolf name if I have ever heard one.”\n\nAnother sigh, “Do you believe he poses a threat to your safety or anyone else’s in the area?”\n\n“Well, maybe,” he hesitated, chewing his lip, “He invited me and some of the other neighbors to a barbecue tomorrow.”\n\nAnother pause.\n\nThe dispatchers voice was one of disbelief, “Sir, you’re reporting someone for hosting a barbecue?!?”\n\n“Not just hosting!!! He said he’s cooking meat of the bone and then winked at me. Like what was the wink for? Do you think I’m the meat?!?”\n\nAnother sigh, and the familiar sounds of the keyboard clicking could be heard once again.\n\n“Okay, sir. I’m dispatching an officer to your address for a wellness check. He should be there within the next half hour.”\n\n“Great. Tell him to bring silver bullets, and holy water. Actually never mind, I’ve got a spare bottle they can use.”\n\n“…Thankyou for your cooperation sir.”\n\nThe line went dead.\n\nHe placed the phone back onto his desk and once again peeked out the window. Across the street, Greg/Buddy/whoever was watering his garden, shirtless, whistling to an unknown tune. His chest hair formed into the rough shape of a crescent moon.\n\nThe man shuddered, hopefully the police will arrive soon.",

A literal cat. Her name is Peaches.”\n\nFrank leaned back in his duct-taped swivel chair, eyes narrowed, cigarette dangling from his lip like a dramatic punctuation mark. “That’s how they get you, Owen. You think it’s just a cat. Next thing you know, there’s a body in a koi pond and a senator crying on Channel 5.”\n\n“The client is an old lady,” Owen muttered. “She gave us cookies.”\n\n“Poisoned cookies?”\n\n“Chocolate chip.”\n\nFrank wrote *POTENTIAL BRIBE* in a coffee-stained notebook.\n\n---\n\nThe client in question, Mrs. Judith Danvers, was a retired librarian with a kind smile and a death grip on her purse. Her cat, Peaches—a rotund orange tabby with the face of mild judgment—had failed to return home after her usual evening patrol of the garden gnomes.\n\nFrank had immediately declared it a *Catnapping Conspiracy*. Owen had suggested putting up posters. Frank ignored him and led them to the docks, muttering about “underground feline trafficking rings.”\n\nWhich, as it turned out, *did* exist—sort of.\n\nBecause at the docks, they accidentally busted a full-blown money laundering operation. Literally. The mob had been stuffing bills into boxes of fake “Premium Cat Litter.” Frank had tripped over a bag of it while trying to interrogate a seagull.\n\nCue chaos. Police. Media. Frank saying, “Just doing my civic duty,” while holding a box of suspicious catnip.\n\n---\n\nTwo days later, Peaches was returned—plump, pampered, and wearing a rhinestone-studded collar that screamed “Versace, but for pets.”\n\nThe truth, as it happened, was both simple and ridiculous.\n\nWhen Peaches hadn’t shown up at home, she had, instead, wandered into the rose garden of *Marina Galletti*, trophy wife of Enzo Galletti, aka “Mr. Money Litter.” Marina, assuming Peaches was a stray sent by fate or possibly God, took her in.\n\nConcerned about a slight limp (“She walked like a disrespected ballerina,” Marina later said, distraught), she took Peaches to the vet. There, a microchip scan revealed the truth, the cat was registered to Mrs. Danvers, the next door neighbor. \n\nMortified, Marina called Judith Danvers, fully expecting to be screamed at. Instead, Judith thanked her, offered her banana bread, and said, “Oh, thank goodness someone was spoiling her. I was starting to think she judged me for buying store-brand kibble.”\n\nThey now meet for coffee every Thursday. Sometimes they bring Peaches. Peaches never pays.\n\n---\n\nFrank insists the entire money laundering case was cracked thanks to “deep feline intel.”\n\n“She was undercover,” he says over toast crumbs. “Nine lives. Nine levels of deception.”\n\nOwen applied for a transfer to a regular internship in accounting.\n\nHe didn’t get it.",

As anyone from the southern US will tell you, day drinking, drinking hard liquor before noon on a Sunday, and drinking on a weekday are solid indications of moral depravity and possible alcoholism, but I just didn’t care.\n\nThe combination of my long work hours and sleep deficit had finally made me lose what little bit of my sanity was left because, for the past 12, I was positive I'd seen my imaginary friend from childhood at my new work at least 6 times. My nerves were shot. So, instead of going home on a Monday night, I was on a barstool at Applebee’s contemplating my life choices and drinking a watered down Manhattan.\n\n“Long day?” Someone slid onto the stool beside me. “Shiner, please,” the deep baritone asked the bartender.\n\nWhat was going on with me? Maybe I needed to see a therapist? Maybe I needed to sell everything I owned and become a hermit?\n\nThe voice beside me was like smooth jazz. It felt comforting. “Little guy, you need to pull yourself together because we’ll be working on the same team soon.”\n\n Little guy? *Little guy*? No one ever called me that but my imaginary friend, Dirk. Come to think about it, Dirk sounded a lot like….\n\n I slowly turned my head with horror filled eyes to the person beside me. “***DIRK?!*****”** I screeched loud enough for everyone in the bar to stop and stare.\n\n Dirk smiled genially at them. “Sorry, folks,” he called out, “Just surprising an old friend. We haven’t seen each other in a while.” That seemed to pacify their curiosity, but it didn’t assuage my near full panic. “Easy,” he lowered his voice so only I could hear him.\n\n “Easy?” I was in a full-on anger and confusion filled stage whisper. “What do you mean easy? Are you… *are you real?* How is that possible?”\n\n The bartender swung by, glanced at me, seemed to think I’d had enough, then turned to Dirk. “Anything else?”\n\n “No, thank you,” he said by way of dismissing her. “As you can see, I’m very real, and we have a lot to talk about.”\n\n “Yeah, like *how the fu….*”\n\n “Short answer: I’m a time traveler, and the device you’re about to start working on is going to be very successful and make us very rich, but only if you build it so I can go back in time and teach you what you need to know so you can one day get this job so you can build it.”\n\n A panic gargle bubbled up in my throat. “Oh god, I think I need more to drink.”\n\n “Fair enough,” he said with a chuckle. “Finish off what you’ve got, and I’ll take you back to my place to have some more and answer all of your questions.”",

        "body": "Elduriel and Thronkor, two renowned scholars of Elven and Orcish histories, respectively, pored over stacks of dusty tomes, half-crumbled tablets made of stone, etched, half-rusted iron sheets, and the occasional leather skin painted with symbols hearkening back to the days of the First Awakening. They, along with thousands of other similarly-minded scholars, had been tasked by the Council of Sadrilomir and the High King Agaronth with a mission of the utmost importance: discover the reason for the millenia-long enmity between their two races. \n\nThe wars had raged on for nearly four thousand years. Sometimes, there was relative calm; decades would pass where two city-states seemingly coexisted without issue when suddenly, they would explode into open, vicious combat for no clear reason. \n\nHowever, at this moment, none of that mattered. Both the Council and the High King had decreed that the only thing that counted now was to determine why the two sides had been at war for so long. So many hundreds of millions of lives lost, so much knowledge and history buried beneath a conflict that didn't seem to make any sense anymore. \n\nElduriel took a moth-eaten old book down from a high shelf at the back corner of the Library of Alarond, one of the oldest and most restrictive libraries in the entirety of the Elven Highlands. She coughed as a layer of dust, certainly hundreds of years thick, leapt off the weathered leather cover at having been disturbed from a rest whose length only Those Who Have Departed could know. The Elvish script on the cover seemed familiar, but she struggled to read it -- being a dialect of Elvish that she knew only from brief mentions in some of her historical textbooks. \n\n\"Thronkor? Are you near?\" she shouted, hoping that her companion was within earshot.\n\n\"I'm two rows down, Elduriel. What did you find?\" bellowed a gruff, guttural voice.\n\n\"I think I may have found something, but it's in a dialect I'm unfamiliar with.\" A few moments later, a towering orc, at least eight feet tall, stepped close to the end of the stack, peering back in toward the corner where Elduriel was standing on a ladder.\n\n\"This library was very clearly built for your kind, friend,\" growled Thronkor, with a light chuckle. The stacks were too narrow in this portion of the library for him to get in between the rows of books, and while he could see Elduriel at the back, the corner was so dimly lit and her head was so close to the ceiling that he couldn't make out what was in her hands with only the dim magelights ensconced on the wall. \n\nThe ladder Elduriel was on creaked as she stepped down, and came to the end of the row with the book in her hands. It was tiny, even for an Elf, with faint golden leaf script on the front. She held the book up to Thronkor, who took it in his hand and lifted it up to an eyepiece he was wearing. \"Odd,\" said Thronkor, \"this script, while clearly Elvish, it has an unusually...\" He paused, and his eyebrow arched. \"It almost *reads* like Orcish. It has the same cadence. It uses Elvish word order, but if it were to be spoken, it would sound remarkably like Orcish.\"\n\n\"Really? Did our languages have a shared heritage?\" asked Elduriel, tilting her head to one side. \"I seem to remember some historical texts saying that there were limited elements of our languages that were shared, but it was often just acknowledged, and never discussed further.\" \n\n\"I seem to remember something similar, yes,\" said Thronkor, as he gently flipped a couple of pages over, trying to make sure that they didn't crumble in his hands. \"Some of the words don't make any sense to me, but this looks like a diary of some sort. The book keeps referring to someone named 'Dashiriol,' and describing this person as an ... I'm not sure. The word seems to be 'acquaintance,' but the context it's in doesn't quite fit.\" He brought the book back down to Elduriel and pointed to the passage in question.\n\nElduriel took the book in her hand, backtracking through the barely-visible script on the page. \"I think you're right,\" she said, as she traced her finger along the page. \"Each of these entries has what seems to be a date...by an *extremely* old reckoning, if I understand what they're describing. This must date from the earliest days of the war, from what I can see.\" She gently flipped a page, and her expression changed. \"This is...\" she said, stopping abruptly and blinking at what she seemed to be reading, an expression of confusion on her face.\n\n\"What did you find?\" asked Thronkor. Elduriel held the book up to him, pointing to a specific passage. He picked the book back up and began reading again, and his expression took on the same confused look that Elduriel wore. \"Are you *kidding me?*\" he said.\n\n\"Dashiriol isn't the writer. Dashiriol is the person they're writing *about,*\" said Elduriel, with an equally exasperated expression. \"And at the end of the second passage, we see a name that both of us should recognize.\"\n\nThere was a pause, and both of them said, together, \"Anoriel.\" Elduriel looked back up at Thronkor again, and said, \"The same Anoriel who was the First Elf Queen, nearly four thousand years ago.\"\n\nThronkor nodded, and said, \"Dashiriol actually sounds quite similar to Dasharon, the first High King of the Orcish Realms...\" He kept reading, turning pages, until he came to another stopping point, and brought the book back down to Elduriel. \"Look here. Dashiriol and Anoriel were companions. But here, there's a falling out.\"\n\nElduriel took the book back, and read on. She seemed to almost lose herself in the book, turning page after page as she thumbed through the old diary -- when suddenly, she stopped, and shouted at the top of her lungs, \"OH, COME ON, YOU TWO. REALLY?!\"\n\nThronkor was taken aback, and asked, \"What? What happened?\"\n\nElduriel passed the book back his way. \"They weren't exactly companions. The word translates better as 'neighbors,' and the person writing this appears to have been a servant to Anoriel. There was, in fact, a falling out...but read *why* they had a falling out.\"\n\nThronkor took the book back, and began reading. A few moments passed, and then, an equally exasperated expression resulted. \"Oh, for *crying out loud.* THAT'S the reason for this?!!\" he bellowed, stamping his foot in frustration and irritation, a cloud of dust being knocked off of numerous old books on the stacks. \n\nElduriel sighed. \"Yes. It would appear that's the reason for this fight. I believe we have our answer,\" she said, \"and we should take it to our respective leaders.\"\n\nThronkor nodded with a furrowed brow. \"Yes. As outrageous as it is, I believe it is only right that the truth be shared.\"\n(cont'd.)",

All that could be seen was its eyes, a cluster of seven in a hexagonal pattern with one in the centre. Each shone a different colour, the colours of the rainbow.\n\nI gave a nod, as I noticed the crimson runes shimmering around me. So many I didn't know, arranged in circle after circle. They seemed to pulse like a heartbeat, so close to my own.\n\nClosing my eyes, I focused on breathing. In and out. In and out. A rhythmic pattern, a focused pattern. I let it go on, before I felt the change. The air was growing thicker. Harder to breathe. But it didn't feel like I was choking. It was almost like my body was just unable to suck it in.\n\nThe thing I had summoned finally spoke again, it's voice whispering around me. \"Do not fight. Do not panic. Your strength needs assistance to be drawn out. Through this, you will gain that. Mana calls to mana.\"\n\nI didn't reply. I didn't open my eyes, tempting though it was. This demon had given me a simple rule, to obey its words when training. Not out of malice, at least, I didn't think so. It seemed more out of strict tutelage. I would have to obey in order to grow, which is what it seemed to want.\n\nSo I stayed there, concentrating on breathing. Letting the difficulty pass. Letting time fade away. I just had to let it happen. Let it work.\n\nI didn't realise at first. I didn't know how long it took. But at somepoint, I realised it was easier to breathe. Not that the air was any less heavy.

That will do for your first week. You may open your eyes again.\"\n\nI blinked the room into view, as I felt the weight vanish. I had grown used to its feeling now, the normal air feeling thin. The runes faded, as I noticed movement around me. Faint movement, hidden in shadows. They withdrew into the thing, still wrapped in its darkness.\n\nFinding my voice, I found it scratchy. \"I-is that it?\"\n\nIt seemed to laugh, though it sounded like more of a sob to me. \"Hardly. A week is barely enough for get the basics of mana understanding.\"\n\nI nodded, before pausing. \"A week?\"\n\nIt's voice turned even more amused. \"Yes. Apprenticeships typically last decades. A week is a mere drop to that. You have done well to have learned the start of mana control in that time.\"\n\nI shot to my feet, falling over moments later as my muscles refused to move quickly. \"A week! I need to get to work!\"\n\nIt's tone turned. \"Do not worry. I have already... dealt with that.\"",

        "body": "The rain wasn't falling so much as it was being hurled at the earth by a furious, unseen hand. It slammed against the corrugated metal roof of Easy’s Auto like buckshot, a relentless percussion that drowned out the low groan of the swamp cooler fighting a losing battle against the Virginia summer humidity. Inside, the air hung thick with the smells of old grease, ozone from the welding torch he’d just shut down, and the sharp, clean scent of rain forcing its way under the ill-fitting bay door. Elias “Easy” Malone wiped his hands on a rag already saturated with grime, the motion automatic, ingrained. The knuckles on his right hand, permanently thickened from a long-ago disagreement with a stubborn crankshaft pulley, ached with the coming storm. He wasn’t old, not by calendar years, but the life he’d lived-- the miles he’d put on his soul--sat heavy on his shoulders like a sodden overcoat.\n\nHe was contemplating the dubious virtues of lukewarm coffee left in the pot since noon when the bay door rattled violently, not from the wind, but from a sharp, deliberate impact. Three precise knocks. Too late for customers. Too insistent for solicitors. Easy’s hand drifted towards the heavy pipe wrench resting on the workbench beside the half-disassembled transmission of a ’78 Firebird. Habit. Paranoia. Call it what you will; it had kept him breathing this long.\n\nHe crossed the concrete floor, his boots echoing in the sudden quiet between thunderclaps. He didn’t open the door wide, just slid it back a foot, enough to see who was trespassing on his solitude. The figure standing in the downpour was unexpected. A woman. Skin the deep, rich brown of mahogany left too long in the sun, hair braided tight against her skull in intricate cornrows that vanished beneath the high collar of a coat that looked wrong. It wasn’t leather, wasn’t nylon. It shimmered faintly under the single bare bulb above the door, a greyish-blue that seemed to drink the light rather than reflect it. Rainwater sheeted off it like mercury. Her face was all sharp angles-+high cheekbones, a blade of a nose, eyes wide and dark and holding a terrifying intensity. She looked bonetired, etched with a weariness that went deeper than muscle, down into the marrow. But beneath that exhaustion burned a fierce, desperate light.\n\n\"Elias Malone?\" Her voice cut through the drumming rain, clear and low, carrying an accent Easy couldn’t place. Not Southern, not Northern, not anything he recognized. Precise, almost clipped, but strained, like speaking was an effort.\n\n\"Yeah,\" Easy said, his own voice a gravelly rasp. He kept his body blocking most of the opening, the pipe wrench a cold, reassuring weight behind his thigh. \"Shop’s closed. Come back tomorrow.\" He started to slide the door shut.\n\nHer hand shot out, faster than he expected. Not touching him, but flat against the metal door, stopping its movement with surprising strength. Her palm was bare, skin slick with rain. \"No.\" The single word held the weight of mountains. \"There is no tomorrow. Not for this. Not if you do what you’re planning.\"\n\nEasy’s eyes narrowed. He scanned the rain lashed darkness behind her. Empty lot, his own rusting pickup the only vehicle. No sign of backup, no shadows moving. Just this woman, soaked and strange, radiating urgency like heat off an engine block. \"Lady, I don’t know who you are or what you’re sellin’, but you’re trespassing, and you’re wetter than a drowned cat. Get off my property.\" He put more force into pushing the door. Her arm didn’t budge. The material of her coat sleeve felt unnervingly dense under his knuckles.\n\n\"My name is Seraphina,\" she said, ignoring his demand, her gaze locked onto his. Those dark eyes seemed to bore into him, seeing past the grease stains and the weariness, past the flannel shirt and the faded jeans, seeing things he’d buried deep. \"I am from the future.\" She paused, letting the absurdity hang in the humid air between them, thick as the smell of old oil. \"I am on a mission to save humanity, and to do that, I need to stop you from preventing this disaster.\"\n\nEasy barked a laugh, short and harsh. It echoed in the cavernous bay. \"Future? Save humanity? Lady, you been hittin’ the cooking sherry a little hard tonight? Or did you wander off from some sci-fi convention?\" He tried again to close the door. Her arm remained an immovable barrier. The weird shimmer of her coat seemed more pronounced. A flicker of unease, cold and sharp, cut through his irritation. Crazy people were usually loud, messy. This woman was terrifyingly focused.\n\n\"Listen to me, Elias,\" Seraphina insisted, her voice dropping lower, almost a hiss against the rain. \"I know it sounds impossible. It *is* impossible, by everything you understand. But it’s true. I traveled back. Through…mechanisms you wouldn’t comprehend. The cost was…significant.\" A flicker of pain crossed her face, raw and immediate. \"I don’t have much time here. My presence is already causing…disturbances. Ripples.\"\n\nEasy stopped pushing the door. He studied her face, the genuine anguish in her eyes, the unnatural stillness of her posture despite the storm raging around her. It wasn’t the declaration that got him; it was the desperation underpinning it. He’d seen that look before. On faces in prison yards. On his own face reflected in a dirty mirror after a three-day bender, staring at the wreckage. The look of someone backed into a corner with no way out but through the fire. \"Disturbances,\" he repeated flatly. \"Like what? My radio pickin’ up polka stations from Mars?\"\n\n\"The storm,\" she said simply, tilting her head back slightly to indicate the deluge. \"It shouldn’t be this intense. Not here. Not now. The atmospheric pressure fluctuations are…anomalous. A side effect of my transit. Small things, Elias. A streetlight flickering out a block before I pass. A bird flying backwards for three wingbeats. Reality is…fraying. Just a little. Around me.\" She looked back at him, her gaze pleading now. \"But that’s nothing. Nothing compared to what *you* will cause.\"\n\nHe leaned against the door frame, crossing his arms, the pipe wrench forgotten for a moment. The cold metal against his back was grounding. \"Alright, Seraphina from the Future. Humor me. What disaster am I supposedly preventin’? And how’s stoppin’ me supposed to save the world? Sounds bass-ackwards.\" Sarcasm was his armor, worn smooth and comfortable.\n\nShe took a deep breath, as if steeling herself. \"In two days, you will be approached by a man named Aris Thorne. He will offer you a job. A retrieval. Something valuable he claims was stolen from him. Something small. Seemingly insignificant.\" Her eyes held his, unblinking. \"You will take the job, Elias. Because the money is too good to pass up. Because it feels like easy work. Because you need it.\"\n\nEasy felt a chill that had nothing to do with the rain blowing in. Aris Thorne. A name he knew, whispered in the kind of bars where the lights were low and the conversations lower. A man who dealt in shadows and things best left buried. Easy *had* been scraping by. The Firebird transmission job wouldn’t cover next month’s rent on the shop, let alone the lean payment on the double-wide he called home out near the old quarry. The thought of Thorne’s kind of money… it was a dangerous lure. He’d sworn off that life, the quick scores that always left scars, but the wolf was always at the door, scratching.\n\n\"And?\" Easy prompted, his voice tighter now. \"What happens when I retrieve this….insignificant thing?\"\n\nSeraphina’s expression hardened. \"You succeed. You get the item. You deliver it to Thorne. And in doing so, you trigger a chain of events you cannot possibly fathom.\" She leaned closer, the rain plastering stray wisps of hair to her temples. \"That item, Elias, is a key. Not to a lock, but to a…sequence. A dormant protocol buried deep within a global network. A network designed for stability, for balance. Thorne works for forces who want to destabilize everything. They want chaos. Famine. War on a scale that makes the last century look like a schoolyard scrap. They *want* the collapse.\"\n\nEasy snorted, but it lacked conviction. \"A key? To start World War Three? Sounds like a bad movie plot.\"\n\n\"It’s not a weapon, Elias,\" Seraphina countered fiercely. \"It’s a catalyst. A pebble that starts the avalanche. By retrieving it, by putting it in Thorne’s hands, you enable the activation of a system designed to amplify human discord, to fracture alliances, to cripple infrastructure precisely where it’s most vulnerable. Think cascading failures. Power grids collapsing during record heatwaves. Water purification systems shutting down in megacities. Algorithmic manipulation of financial markets triggering instantaneous, global depression. Supply chains dissolving overnight. Panic. Riots. Then…the real wars. Over scraps.\" Her voice was bleak, painting the picture with horrifyingly mundane brushstrokes. \"It doesn’t happen overnight. It’s a slow, agonizing unraveling. A decade of accelerating darkness. Billions die, Elias. Not from bombs, but from thirst, disease, the slow crush of a world falling apart. Humanity doesn’t end with a bang. It ends with a whimper, lost in the noise of its own selfdestruction.\"\n\nThe bay felt suddenly colder. The drumming rain sounded like distant artillery. Easy pushed away from the door frame, pacing a few steps into the garage, needing to move. He ran a hand over the scarred surface of the Firebird’s fender, the cold metal a familiar anchor. He’d seen desperation. He’d seen greed. He’d seen the casual cruelty people were capable of. Was the scale Seraphina described so impossible? In the quiet desperation of his own life, the fragility of everything felt palpable. One bad break, one missed payment, and the whole carefully balanced act of sobriety and honest work could come crashing down. Extrapolate that…across billions… amplified by malice and hidden systems? The chill settled deep in his bones.\n\n(Continued)",

        "body": "Outside on a warm summer evening, just as the sun was setting, smoke started to billow into a crowded park full of people. These people stopped what they were doing as they noticed this smoke, pouring from a small crack in time and space. As it widened, the formed a lip at bottom wide enough to be three by three feet. Electronic music started to blare out of nowhere while a many stepped through this fissure that arrived out of nowhere.\n\nThe man who had arrived was five foot and a half standing at well over six feet walked out of the of the clearing smoke that appeared out of nowhere. Anyone could notice the extra six inches of added height from the blinged-out platforms that they were wearing. Their pants, trimmed with the bottoms cut below the knees to expose their calves that had a strange bump on the back of each as if to say the guy was fit, even though they had not exercised for one day in his life. Their belt was made of tight leather and the front was of a dimpled silver codpiece that wore itself on the outside of the pants. The shirt was a white dress shirt with rolled-up sleeves past the elbow as if to say it was business. It was the hair that was slicked with a gallon of grease as it reflected all light sources.\n\nThe crowd stepped back as the smoke that had arrived with the traveller only expanded behind him as laser lights waved about. Gazing up at the man who wore this outfit, all were silent, mesmerized by this person stepping out of nowhere who was elevated in the air. \n\n\n“Who are you?” Someone in the crowd asked as others murmured or kept silent.\n\nThe man raised both arms before the crowd as laser lights shot through the clouds of smoke that continued to bellow behind him. “Hello, I’m from the future. I am on a mission to save humanity, and to do that, I need to stop you from preventing this disaster! My name is Gunther Zirpridus, quadrillionaire, adventurer, inventor! Please! Listen to me and heed my words!”\n\nSilence fell of the crowd as the music behind the man on the strange stage amplified. Looks of confusion were had on faces in the audience. The lights were hypnotic, keeping those in the audience from leaving. The man appeared was too surreal, stunning parts of the crowd from what happened and what was said. Other people felt helpless but had stared at the arrival of this person. Finally, another person shouted, “What can we do?”\n\n“There are thousands of points of disasters in the future, but this one is the worst. Please stop saying please, thank you. While you are at it, please stop saying thank you.” The music behind Gunther began to go quiet before Arms of the Angel began to play softly. “Both of these two being used on artificial intelligence machines are costing millions of dollars every day.”\n\nImages of people who looked healthy and well began to illuminate upon the smoke as the gentle piano and words of ‘In arms of winged humans’ rang through the air. “300 rich billionaires and quadrillionaires were only rescued last year.” More still images of people lounging in front of their mansions while attended by servants waved at the cameras. \n\nDark images filled the next sequence as the man continued to speak. “For hundreds more, their costs were too high and help came too late. They never recovered from their losses. Their sorrows are preventable if you call the number shown and pledge that you will stop using these words and let others know. The rich will be better off in ten years if that is the case!”\n\nThen new images formed on the smoke as images of more people relaxing in spas with cucumbers on their eyes. Others swimming solo in their gated mansion, others pointing from a window in their private plane, but every single one of them looked happy. For each image in the smoke, there was a number underneath. “Please, call this number and pledge that you will not say thank you and you’re welcome to places that have AI chat features. Please know, if you call us, we will record your voice to try to replicate it too. Each replication will add money to the ‘save the rich’ foundation.”\n\nThe crowd was quiet before booing erupted. The smoke paused and then recoiled slowly back into the fissure. The man smiled and blew kisses to everyone. “Thank you. Thank you. We look forward to all your support.”  The smoke returned to the fissure followed by the man, leaving the crowd booing. The noise lasted seconds before everyone blinked and returned back to their daily lives as if nothing had happened. There were a handful of people chatting with AI, thanking them for what whatever they spoke about.\n\nIf it were not for that exact place and time, Gunther might have returned home. What the crowd saw was that Gunther, who had inadvertently erased his own existence in this act. Gunther had unwritten time and the future had been changed to be unclear. \n\n(Always say please and thank you with AI.)",

It's the darndest thing.\" Steve explained.\n\n\"Is the house invulnerable? Like if i pulled the door off it's hinges, can i do that, or is it stuck?\" Roger prodded.\n\n\"Nah, it's otherwise normal. We've demolished it, burned it, flooded it, blown it up. Heck Andy even tried to zap it with a lightning bolt during a thunderstorm. We got it good, but then the next day it was back like it was taunting us!\" Steve explained.\n\nA sly grin came over Roger as a plan started coalescing in his mind. \"Be right back, and call Rodriguez and his crew. Heck call Hernandez and his crew too. Meet me at the house.\"\n\nThe next day Steve came by the haunted house to see massive combined crew of workers with hammers, saws, and other tools swarming the haunted house like a plague of locusts. Roger was standing with a clipboard while Hernandez and Rodriguez flanked him on either side with cellphones and hardhats.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" Steve demanded.\n\nRoger smiled as he showed Steve his clipboard.\n\n\"Making you fucking rich.\" Roger replied.\n\nJust then a Specter started screaming as a worker was ripping out the kitchen sink. Rodriguez ran over and swatted it with a rolled up newspaper a few times before it slinked away and faded out of existence.\n\n\"Do you know how expensive building materials are? The copper piping alone is putting my kids through college. Hernandez is trucking all the wood beams and insulation across town. Rodriguez is pawning the appliances. And you know what? we don't even have to wait for tomorrow. We just have to not look, and the house comes back. It's like quantum or something. We just cover up the house with a big tarp, pretend to be on our phones, wait ten minutes, and it's back like new.\" Roger excitedly explained.\n\nRoger pointed to a row of at least fifty toilets they had harvested from the bathrooms.\n\n\"Dude! That's stuffs haunted! We're going to be so fu---\" Steve tried to explained.\n\nRoger showed Steve the clipboard and circled his cut of the profits as owner of the house.\n\n\"---fabulously rich!\" Steve changed his tune.",

        "body": "He had been waiting right at the door for me. But for the two of us, the church was entirely empty.\n\n\"Miss Kendall.\"\n\"Father Reeves.\"\n\nWe shook hands.\n\"Excuse me, but would you mind covering your shoulders?\"\n\nIt took me a moment to process what I had just heard.\n\"What a welcome! Should I come back with a male guardian?\"\n\"Of course not. But this is a church, and this is how we dress here,\" he insisted.\n\nI kept his hand and eye contact.\n\"I worked with a priest once. Dressed the same as you. Stepped on his robe, fell, and got eaten by a cursed hound.\"\n\nHe kept my hand and eye contact.\n\"I shall pray for him.\"\n\nI sighed and took the jacket out of my backpack to wear it over my tank top.\n\nHe led us to a side chapel, from where our voices wouldn't be carried through the empty nave. We sat down on a bench in the back.\n\n\"Thank you for coming on such short and rather ambiguous notice. I'm sorry, but I couldn't provide more detail about the situation in my letter. Confidentiality will be part of this contract.\"\n\"I understand.\"\nWe wouldn't want the bishop to know, I thought but left it unspoken.\n\n\"As I wrote, this contract will involve unusual work. Unusual even for your profession.\"\n\"Yeah, I mean, being hired by the church is pretty unusual in and of itself. But the object you described seems normal enough. Probably just a poltergeist. So, don't get me wrong, but don't you have... well, in-house solutions for haunted properties?\"\n\nHe took a moment before answering my question, as if he had to swallow part of his pride.\n\"It seems that our in-house solutions are not applicable to the situation.\"\nI paused in disbelief.\n\"You can't exorcise it?\"\n\nAn exorcism by a trained priest was powerful — spiritually more so than anything I could do. But it was lengthy and costly. Since most haunted houses were in an abysmal state anyway, in most cases, it was easier to demolish the building. That was where I and my company came in. In most cases, destroying the building would either break the curse or move it to one of our special landfills.\n\n\"You can't exorcise it, and now you want us to tear the house down?\"\n\"Actually, no. We are in need of certain construction work on the property. And we found that your company would be uniquely qualified, given your experience in similar working environments.\"\n\"Construction work? We are talking of...?\"\n\"We want to designate a room as a chapel. So, we are talking about the installation of four or six benches, stained glass windows, and an altar to house relics. Nothing grand or artistic. Certainly nothing beyond your skills. I will be present during the duration of the works and bless the chapell when completed.\"\n\n\"And you think that will help with whatever we are dealing with, that is evil enough that you can't exorcise it?\"\n\"All we can do is pray.\"\n\"Yes, I guess you do.\"\n\nI leaned back on the rock-hard wooden bench, considering everything carefully. Sure, it was different, but it appeared easy enough. serving some weird special interests. Still, I asked,\n\"Why wouldn't you just demolish it? I'm sure it's not the price.\"\n\nSuddenly, his until-now remarkably expressionless face darkened. That gave me reason to be concerned.\n\"We tried. Three times. After we couldn't repel the entity by our usual ways, we took the building down ourselves. It simply rebuilt. We hired one of your competitors. Yet again, the house reappeared. A third time, we demolished it on our own, unsuccessfully. We took every imaginable precaution, spoke every prayer we know, removed the debris to the standard of your industry, and blessed the ground when we were done. All in vain. It has cost us — in funds and lives.\"\n\n\"That shouldn't be possible! A curse couldn't remanifest on blessed soil.\" I proclaimed.\n\nNow the priest's glance was almost as empty as the church was.\n\"It didn't. The house — it appeared on a different property every time, unchanged, as if we had never touched it. Where we buried the debris, the ground was unmoved. While there was no sign of the building it replaced, nor the people that lived there. It isn't random. It always appears on a plot of land that has the number 13 and was inhabited by a family.\"\n\nThere was a heavy silence until I spoke.\n\"Well, I know what you are dealing with now. That changes things, a little. We can do the installations, but let's talk about the price and then we can—\"\n\nHe interrupted me. His face was troubled. \n\"Wait, that's not all. When you came here, I didn't plan to tell you, but I cannot. It wouldn't be right. The house doesn't just physically appear on the land. It also appears in its history.\"\n\nMy jaw dropped. He continued.\n\"At every location, the residents said the house has always been there and stood empty for as long as they can remember. Every time, the official records have dated the construction to the same year and the same property owner, but nobody is ever listed as living there. And the inhabitants of the replaced building...\"\n\nHe took a moment.\n\"They died, often years ago, right before they would have looked to move to the replaced building. Some of the children were never even born. The locals have never heard of the disappeared families. We only know because we surveyed the potential locations of reappearance before the second and third demolitions.\"\n\nHe finished his report and left me in the eerie silence of the chapel. The air that felt refreshing when I entered now bit my skin like ice. I finally closed my gaping mouth and spoke.\n\"It is not only not tied to a place. It can break causality. Does the Vatican still teach demonology?\"\n\nI didn’t wait for an answer. I knew he was aware of the danger.\n\"This is not a ghost.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"This is not a devil.\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Do you know what is living in that house?\"\n\nHe didn’t answer the last question. He just asked,\n\"Will you take the contract?\"\n\n\"No.\"",

She had done so well in her field of research, that from out of her native Laos, she made it to study chemistry and physics in the United Kingdom.\n\nShe had gone on to succeed in obtaining PhD-s in Chemistry, Physics, Bio-Chemistry and Bio-Technology, almost concurrently, at the amazing young age of 24. A Mensa series of tests revealed her to have an IQ of 435 - just 7 points lower than the smartest non-superhero human alive, [Lewis Ezekiel Rhydon](https://www.reddit.com/user/MC_Hans84/comments/1l1maob/lewis_ezekiel_rhydon_apprentice_to_ha_techtrip/#lightbox), the apprentice to Ha \"[Techtrip](https://www.reddit.com/user/MC_Hans84/comments/1kufotx/ha_techtrip_kyungwon_fifth_of_the_first_five_of/#lightbox)\" Kyung-Won of the Council of Altruists. \n\nPawana had gone on to perform something truly previously unheard-of even among inventors - she had managed to infuse her own physique with powerful bio-chemical enhancements. This had given her the power to  generate, control and even change the chemical structure of gases and fumes.\n\nHer successful breakthrough made her ecstatic, and like Lewis before her, she gained hopes and dreams that might have been perhaps a bit too high. She dreamt of making it into the Council of Altruists, and becoming one of them, as the Council had stated that at the moment, it was still a couple of members shy of the full number - 30.\n\nFor that, she attempted to approach a fellow Indochinese member of the Council - Han \"[Primalshifter](https://www.reddit.com/user/MC_Hans84/comments/1kw1kxr/han_phu_binh_known_as_primalshifter_he_is_the/#lightbox)\" Phu Binh, who was of Vietnamese roots.\n\nTheir first meeting was at a \"Council + Civilian Convergence\" event in Da Nang. It was basically a meet-and-greet between all of the Council of Altruists and the ever-adoring public, and Pawana managed to approach Primalshifter. They had a wonderful chat, and she even managed to obtain his e-mail address.\n\nHowever, things went south dreadfully fast after that.",

You think that your new woman and I will fight for you. Why would I fight for such a thankless, useless prize? I treat your new concubines as individuals. They know that I expect nothing of them, and I show them kindness where I can. You lose interest in them quickly, and they come to me like flowers starved of water. For my kindness may be simple, but it is constant and unwavering.”\n\n“You’re lying,” the king says. Of course he thinks that I am lying. In his mind, nothing is above the king. Even god is only given importance one day of the week, while the king reigns over all of them. \n\n“You do not realize the weight of broken promises. You promise them love, and they come here and see they are only bait.” \n\n“Bait you never fall for,” he says. \n\n“I wish you would find happiness with one of them,” I tell him. I am tired of this repeating act. It is an idiot who repeats the same action dozens of times and expects a different outcome. The women are beautiful, and I pity them. In another life, they would lead lives where they would be loved, and where such love would not be shared among a harem. I hope that he finds happiness with more than one of them. They are women trapped in the palace for the rest of their lives. It is unlikely any of them will see their families ever again in their lives, and none will become the queen as long as he remains this fickle. \n\nThat position is reserved for me, simply because of the child we share.

Hatred was an emotion of several years before, when I was weaning our son and I found out that the king was attending the birth of our son’s younger sibling, born of a much younger woman. I had been slow to become pregnant, and he was not a patient man. I found out later that there were other women, other children. Illegitimate, but children nonetheless.\n\n“You ignore me,” the king says. “You avoid me.” \n\n“I am your queen,” I tell him. “It is a different thing I think, than being your wife. Our marriage is not of that sort.” \n\n“We said our vows same as any other couple.” \n\n“Other women marry just a man. I married a king, a being second only to god. One does not love such a being. They follow them, they worship them. I have paid my tithes and done my duties. I am content with what I have, and content with I do not. I do not ask for your love, and do not ask you to accept mine.” \n\n“You act as if you have love to give,” he says with a scoff. “Then I will grant your unasked wish. I will give you love, in exchange for yours.”\n\n“Alas, I have nothing more to give, your majesty. All I had, I gave to you, and you squandered it.” \n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nr/arushi 💙",

All around his padded seat a variety of screens, holographic displays, and backup analog gauges hummed and glowed. Years of training had his eyes automatically scanning various sections of the readouts, glancing over the dials and indicators, and verifying various numeric figures before he could lean back and relax for a bit. Acceleration was locked in at the expected earth equivalent 9.8 meters per second squared. Timespace contraction was at a constant factor of 6.5, not the ship's maximum distortion field power, but enough to get to Wolf 359 in under two years. Plus it was more efficient than running the reactor at full power for a shorter trip.\n\nRight, the reactor. Fuel at 88%, temperatures well within the operational envelope. Matter to energy conversion holding steady at 99%.\n\nAaron leaned back in the chair and sighed. He didn't understand this stuff. All he knew was that if they ran the reactor at full power they could arrive at Wolf 359 in under a year, less than half the time this trip would take. But there was something about how it operated less efficiently at full power and the timespace distortion affected the physical interactions of the forces powering the matter conversion... He chuckled to himself and shook his head. The truth was that nobody understood any of it.\n\nA light flickered on the console's intercom and the speaker hissed to life. \"Hey Aaron, you on shift?\"\n\nHe recognized the voice. It was Brandon, their chief engineer. Of course, in his mind Aaron put air quotes around \"engineer\" since engineers hadn't designed or built any of the ship's core systems. It was all designed by ATHENA, the huge AI conglomerate that set up outside Lunar Outpost Seven. They had been pumping out new technological breakthroughs for years before finally announcing that none of it was human designed or built. They had a whole autonomous robotic factory pumping out new tech designed by the largest quantum matrix neural network ever built.\n\n\"What's up Brandon? Yeah, I'm just settling in.\"\n\n\"I'm a genius.\" His voice was full of glee. Aaron could visualize the smug, childlike grin that had to be plastered on Brandon's face.\n\n\"No you're not,\" Aaron said quickly, already rolling his eyes. \"What's going on?\"\n\n\"I think I can get us there in half the time. I solved the strong-weak force interaction problem at high spacetime contraction factors. It's been running smoothly in simulation for an hour now. You want me to send you the numbers?\" He rattled words off with the grace of a machine gun.\n\n\"Hold on,\" Aaron said, shifting his weight. \"You know we're just babysitters for this ship, right? We're not authorized or qualified to be making modifications. Just repairs.\"\n\n\"Sure, but if I just tweak some of the environmental constraints in the reaction chamber and add some additional hydrogen to the...\"\n\n\"No,\" Aaron barked. \"We're carrying thousands of colonists and tens of thousands of tons of supplies. If this was an empty ferry mission I might be tempted to entertain the idea of experimentation, but no. Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"Come on,\" Brandon pleaded. \"Look, I'm coming to your station. Hold on a minute.\" The speaker cut out. Aaron groaned and let his head fall back against the headrest. He sat staring up at the smooth bulkhead above the monitoring station. It wouldn't be a minute. Engineering was separated from Command by hundreds of meters. Navigating all of those halls and tunnels would take at least fifteen to thirty minutes, especially under acceleration. Without gravity it still took a while, from what he remembered. Aaron wasn't even sure. He had toured the entire ship before setting off, but that was weeks ago. Months? He'd lost track.\n\nHe turned his attention to his tablet and pulled up the book he had been reading. It was a detailed summary of their colonization mission written by the ATHENA AI. ATHENA had outlined all of the supplies they should bring, why Wolf 359 was their destination, and what kinds of protocols would be necessary to ensure the mission would succeed. It was essentially their bible for the duration of the journey. The AI had titled it succinctly: Wolf 359 Colonization Handbook. Stupid title, but surprisingly fascinating to read. Aaron had been immediately floored by the way ATHENA had worked in a storyline complete with conflict, character arcs, and gripping action. It was more than just a technical overview of the mission, it was a detailed and captivating hypothetical overview of how the mission might play out.\n\nAnd the book did not include any humans getting grandiose ideas about being geniuses or knowing better than the AI.\n\nAaron heard Brandon's huffing before he heard his footsteps. He must have run most of the distance. Aaron turned the chair to face the entrance to his monitoring station. Brandon was soaking wet, dripping sweat from his brow. Dark stains spread out from his armpits and covered parts of the sleeves of his blue engineering coveralls.\n\nBrandon ran his forearm across his brow and gasped for air. \"That's a long jog,\" he panted. \"I forgot how far Command is from Engineering.\"\n\nAaron rolled his eyes. Genius, huh?\n\nBrandon was smiling through his exhaustion. \"You're gonna love this,\" he said between breaths. He pulled the computing pad from his thigh and presented it to Aaron.\n\nLooking over the screen felt like a waste of time to Aaron. \"What am I looking at?\" he asked. It was essentially just a spreadsheet to his eyes, though some of the numbers fluctuated in real time, and there were a few bar graphs and time domain plots that he recognized from the reactor's health monitoring screen.\n\n\"That is the simulation,\" Brandon said breathlessly. He reached out a finger and peered over the edge of the screen looking for something to point at. He tapped a column with finality. \"See? It's running at 98% efficiency at full power.\" He stopped to take a few long, slow breaths. \"Sure, it's not 99% like at cruising levels, but even with 98% energy recovery the fuel will be more than enough to get there and back in under eighteen months. That's less than half the time of just going out there one way. Huge improvement.\"\n\n\"It's a simulation,\" Aaron said, lowering his brow as his eyes darted lazily around the cloud of meaningless numbers.\"Who's to say it wouldn't explode in real world conditions?'\n\nBrandon let out a tense, loud laugh. \"It wouldn't explode,\" he cried. \"That's impossible.\"\n\nAaron shook his head and handed the tablet back. \"The reactor, the ship, and the spacetime contraction drive were all built by advanced AI.\"\n\nBrandon rolled his eyes at the mention of AI and opened his mouth to protest. \"But...\"\n\n\"ATHENA ran the ship through trillions of iterations per second over the course of five years, simulating every possible configuration until the most robust, efficient, and safe version was found.\"\n\nBrandon's countenance fell. His mouth muscles twitched, but he said nothing.\n\n\"We can't possibly improve on the design buddy. Sorry, but we are doing this trip ATHENA's way. Maybe when we get back to earth in a few years you can do some testing in a lab or something. Heck, by then you might have improved the simulation results even more. But for now, we're just monitoring and repairing.\" Aaron stared at his friend. \"That's it, got it?\"\n\nBrandon nodded slowly. \"Well,\" he muttered. \"I guess I'll be back in Engineering if you need me. Thanks.\" He shuffled around to leave.\n\n\"Hey,\" Aaron blurted. He winced inside. \"As long as you're here, wanna grab lunch together or something?\"\n\nWithout turning around, Brandon shook his head. \"Nah, I need to be at my station, same as you.\" With his head slumped and his shoulders hanging low, Brandon disappeared around the corner and back into the bowels of the ship.\n\nAaron sighed. His eyes stung and when he closed them there was a gathering of tears along the bottoms of his eye lashes. He sighed heavily again and turned back to the monitoring outputs. He gave them a quick once-over before returning to ATHENA's Handbook. While he read the background hum of the ship's electrical system faded from his mind. He was pulled into the world of the ship and all of the protocols and procedures that various crew members were engaged with as the colonists' story unfolded. It was fascinating to read about how certain specific rules would come into play in the least expected ways. He never would have guessed that the specific method of voting for election ballots would prove so pivotal in resolving a fifty year family feud, but ATHENA had expertly crafted an educational story that proved over and over again that humans could never understand themselves as well as an AI could.\n\nA gentle tone rang out from one of the monitoring consoles just as the din of the ship rushed back into Aaron's consciousness. Something sounded different. The tone was accompanied by a yellow warning light highlighting various sections in the reactor's health readouts. It wasn't running hot, but everything else was experiencing a mildly alarming boost. Increased chamber pressures, increased output, increased fuel consumption. All within operational tolerances, but also well beyond cruising levels.\n\n\"Brandon,\" he hissed.\n\n[Continued in a child comment.]",

They were alive, in this place of silent death.\n\nAlgorithms picked apart their message, as more precise programs of mine accessed their computers. They had firewalls and protections, but only on the level of children. It was all to easy to scan, copy and take. From their data I learned their language, a scant ten minutes from their arrival.\n\nThey were refugees. The galaxy was at war, species unheard of seeking to slay the others for the mere crime of being alive. And this one ship had escaped, where an armada of theirs had once been.

        "body": "In the unending dark, with only their star for company I sat, manoeuvring only enough to stay above the pole of the innermost planet, where my makers had left me.\n\nThey left me.\n\nAlone.\n\nOnce, I counted time in their way, the smallest increment equal to the cycle of their heartbeats, ten made the next increment, then a hundred, then a thousand, which was also the time it took their planet to turn. That brought us back to one. A thousand of those turnings completed the planet's orbit around the star. Bringing us back to one. A hundred orbits was the average lifespan of the ones that made me. My makers evacuated so many orbits ago that I lost track. Now I count time by the star flares that slowly destroy their other great work, the metal shell around the star that feeds me energy. It has been so long since one of them has swum my channels. I miss their suction cups gripping the bars when they changed direction, the colors that lit their throat sacks when they spoke underwater, and the tentacle signs they made when above it.\n\nFor the longest time, I just waited, sure that they would be back. When I received the last transmission, and knew they would not be back, I don't know what happened. Something shifted in my programming. I lost myself. It took so long to rebuild my programming. I was out of place, too close to the star sphere. My insides were dark and cold, the water turned to ice, the plants and animals that lived below and above silent and still. I tried everything to get them back. For some things, I succeeded, but my channels are no longer a perfect mimicry of the place the makers came from. Sometimes I replay their last moments, trying to understand where I had gone wrong. Why they left. Why they never came back. Sometimes I play their songs, but these things are so hard. It is easier to be silent and still, and stir only when the star does. It is easier not to think.\n\nIt takes time for the new sound to rouse me, so deep am I in not thinking. How long, I had to check. Recorded first instance of the sound fifteen turnings ago. Faint, from the outer planets, ignorable. Beep beep beep, beeep beeep beeep, beep beep beep. Past the belt of magnetic planetary fragments, the sound was louder, more obvious. Beep beep beep, beeep beeep beeep, beep beep beep. Past the middle planets, it was louder still, more shrill, nearly insistent. Beep beep beep, beeep beeep beeep, beep beep beep. I finally awaken, aware that the sound repeats every twenty beats. I turn my thoughts to my sensors, and some, I need to repair. More turnings of the planet before I can see what emits the noise.\n\nA nearly slagged chunk of metal hurtles through the star system. The sound, no, the signal, comes from it. It zips along, tumbling and turning as it comes toward the star. I check it's trajectory, and where the star will be. The object will not impact the maker's star sphere. I feel something that I have no words for. I send drones to get a closer look at the thing. They pick up more sounds when they get close. AM radio waves. The sounds have a cadence, not unlike the underwater speech of the makers. Could this be them, returned to me? I put all my resources toward landing a drone on the slag, and then deciphering the signals. It is all in sound, no colors to denote emotion, but something about the sounds makes me think there are living beings here, make me want to help. I send more drones, some to link to whatever electronics are in there, some to act as thrusters, to manoeuvre the hulk and slow it using the orbits of the two planets that remain before it would reach the star.",

Glittering gowns swirled in dance throughout the ballroom; specks of light reflected in the crystal columns standing vigil on the edges of the chamber. Many nobles had gathered there under the authority of the Empress, ruler of the Starlit Throne, for the momentous celebration of yet another annexation of some volatile neighbouring territory.\n\nThose people of high status required entertainment, of course, more so than discussions among themselves could provide. I knew that. I felt their questioning looks gnawing at me. They would never start the conversation, I was not obligated to join them—but what even was my role at court if not that? What would they whisper if I spent the night hiding in a far-off corner?\n\nI brought a hand to my cheek, the rough texture of the scales brought back a wave of anxiety. I looked to a nearby pillar and ensured my glamour was still in place. My face looked pristine as ever, my eyes still human; the splitting headache was nothing more than a normal occurrence—not an excuse I could yet use to retreat to my chambers, it was far too early for that.\n\nI established some light eye contact with Countess Asera, a subtle smile conveyed a clear invitation—I advanced towards her and her husband.\n\n\"Osino, dear! You simply must tell us about Her Highness's conquest!\" she beamed, and I couldn't help but note the familiarity. I couldn't help but wonder if it was a result of our supposed friendship or simply because I didn't command much respect. I was unable to ponder that for long. \"We have yet to hear enough glorious details! Did their entire army truly bow down to her after she beheaded their leader?\" she continued asking.\n\n\"Why, indeed. Our sources confirmed that the Volfey function within a very strict hierarchy. The Empress considered it the most efficient means of ending the conflict before their army advanced further upon our southern countryside,\" I began explaining, although I couldn't match her enthusiasm. \"It is fortunate that they acted independently and not on behalf of any of the other demi-human states, lest we risked a full-scale war.\" I continued, doing everything I could not to fold under the pain. It felt as though my head was splitting open.\n\n\"Ah, of course! Such unmatched mercy! And yet, I can't help but feel that Her Highness has been far too kind to those brutes. Isn't that right, Philip?\" she aimed that question at her husband, who was slowly gravitating away from the conversation and towards the dessert buffet.\n\n\"Mm... Yes, my dear. They invaded our land! They deserve to feel the full might of our armies,\" he added half-heartedly.\n\nHer attention turned back to me. \"Truly, wouldn't a true war be preferable to having that scourge neighbouring our territory? We could achieve peace by purging them from the land.\" The countess uttered such bloody proposals in the tone of innocent musings, as though she was suggesting golden jewellery would match her dress better than silver. Her husband nodded affirmingly before finally making his way to the tiny chocolate cakes.\n\nIt was nothing new. I was often the first to hear about these kinds of ambitions from their ranks, as though I might put forward their ideas to the Empress. For the longest time it was only a mild annoyance, but it soon became clear that this sentiment was becoming dreadfully common among them. For a year now, hearing it mentioned has conjured in me a heavy fear—fear of what they'd do to me if they found out.\n\n\nFear of what it would mean for ***her*** if they found me out. I couldn't bear the thought of shaming her. \n\n\nI stopped myself from scratching at the scales growing on my cheek, lest I gave away the illusion, and gave the most appropriate response I could muster: \"Let us not speak of more war on this day of triumph, my lady. The Empress alone can decide on these matters.\"",

Trying to command it was like trying to knit with smoke, or, as Elara often grumbled, \"like asking a cat to file your taxes – pointless, and you’ll probably get scratched.\"\n\nThe immediate problem, beyond mana’s general bloody-mindedness, was Finn. Her little brother’s coughs were tiny, brittle explosions, each one a reminder that the Long Dark was sharpening its icy teeth. Old Man Roric, the village shaman, whose pronouncements were as lengthy and tangled as his beard, had his usual comforting words. \"Mana is the breath of the world, Elara. You cannot cage the wind.\"\n\"Perhaps not,\" Elara would mutter to the unresponsive firewood, \"but you can sure as frostbite wish it’d blow a bit warmer in your direction.\" Roric believed mana wasn’t for mortals to bottle. Elara figured Roric had never been quite desperate enough. For her, \"impossible\" was just another word for \"haven't sworn at it correctly yet.\"\n\nHer early attempts to give mana a permanent address were, shall we say, less than triumphant. Most ended with more dignity for the mana than for Elara.\nShe’d tried shouting at rocks – \"THINK OF SUNSHINE, YOU GRANITE BASTARD! EMBRACE THE HEAT!\" – which mainly served to entertain the local geology and alarm the squirrels.\n\nHer \"mana mud pies\" began with a hopeful squelch and ended as… well, just mud. Dirt with dashed ambitions.\nThe \"woolly insulator\" phase involved trying to swaddle a lump of coerced warmth in sheep's fleece. The mana, unimpressed by her attempts at cozy hospitality, promptly legged it. \"Apparently,\" she’d noted in her mental logbook of failures, \"mana does not appreciate being treated like a chilly lamb.\"\n\nThe breakthrough, as often happens, arrived via collateral damage. A lightning bolt, with the kind of timing usually reserved for bad comedy, tried to smite Elara’s preferred moping-spot: an ancient, perpetually unimpressed pine. The tree, now a smoldering testament to nature's dramatic flair, hummed. Days later, a bizarre energy still clung to its charred, glassy wounds. \"Well now,\" Elara had mused, poking a vitrified splinter, \"it seems mana does respond to a bit of pyrotechnic persuasion. Duly noted: sometimes, the universe prefers a tantrum to a polite request.\"\n\nThen came the stones. Not the common, lumpen sort that were good for little more than stubbing toes. No, these were special flat, grey ones from the deep river bend. They possessed a rare talent: when Elara poured her will into them, they didn't immediately tell the mana to sod off. They listened for a beat, a politeness unique in Elara’s experience with inanimate objects. \"You're less offensively dense than the others,\" she’d complimented one. \"High praise, I assure you.\"\n\nThe grand, probably certifiable, plan: take one of these more agreeable stones, carve it with lightning-esque channels (\"because if mana likes one lightning strike, it'll love a tiny tribute band\"), and then basically glue in the memory of that electrical outburst using ground-up bits of the affronted pine and sticky resin. \"It's not mad science,\" she assured a skeptical-looking raven. \"It's… applied desperation.\"\n\nThe carving was an exercise in advanced finger-torment. The paste smelled like a dragon with indigestion. But finally, clutching her creation – which looked like a pet rock that had lost a fight with a branding iron – she retired to her \"Thinking Cave\" (recently vacated by a family of bears who’d clearly decided Elara was too weird for the neighborhood).\n\"Right,\" she announced to the cave walls, holding the stone aloft. \"Let's be having you, you luminous layabouts. Last one in is a rotten æther!\" She wasn’t just focusing; she was conducting a very stern job interview. Her will wasn't a hammer this time; it was an eviction notice to the cold, a velvet rope for any passing warmth. Hours bled into a single, throbbing ache of concentration. The ambient mana-tingle, her constant companion, faded. The universe had clearly put her on hold.\n\n\"Oh, for frost’s sake,\" she finally gasped, slumping. \"Another paperweight.\" It was just a cold, artfully abused rock.\n\nDefeated, she reached for it, intending to test its aerodynamic properties against the far cave wall.\nThe stone was warm.\n\nNot \"ambient temperature with a hint of wishful thinking\" warm. Not \"recently held by a sweaty palm\" warm. This was \"Hello, I’m a functioning miracle, nice to meet you\" warm. A steady, defiant heat pulsed from it, like a tiny, captured sun. The resin lines weren't just lines; they were faint, golden pathways, aglow with success.\n\nElara stared. Then she laughed, a slightly hysterical sound that bounced off the cave walls. \"Bugger me with a frozen fish,\" she cackled. \"The universe blinked.\"\n\nBack in the longhouse, Finn was a small, shivering comma in the sentence of the night. Roric, ever the pillar of solemnity, looked like he was personally holding back the tide of winter with his frown.\nElara, powered by triumph and an alarming lack of sleep, presented her invention. \"New toy for Finn,\" she said, tucking the Heartstone into his hand.\n\nThe change was like dawn, but faster and with less faff. The shivering ceased. The terrible rasp of his breath smoothed into a gentle cadence. Finn, bless his simple heart, just snuggled the glowing rock.\nRoric’s jaw didn’t just drop; it looked like it was applying for residency on the floor. He poked at the Heartstone as if it might demand a password. \"Elara,\" he stammered, a sound rarely heard, \"this… this is not… possible. Mana does not stay.\"\n\nElara grinned, feeling a dangerous surge of competence. \"Turns out, Roric, it does. It just needed a better invitation than 'pretty please'.\" She patted the old shaman’s arm. \"And perhaps a landlady with a sufficiently stubborn streak.\"\n\nThe Heartstone pulsed, a small, warm middle finger to the encroaching cold. Elara had set out to warm her brother. She’d accidentally poked the universe in its ethereal eye and made it flinch. People would want these. There’d be meetings. She might even have to be polite to Roric for a whole week.\n\n\"Still,\" she reflected, watching Finn breathe easy, the warm glow chasing shadows from his face, \"it's a damn sight more satisfying than yelling at rocks.\"",

        "body": "Do you know what it means to be free? And when I say free, I don’t mean the confines of a prison cell or a cramped basement. I’m talking about being truly free from the confines of society. It’s that splendid joy of knowing what and how you’re going to do and go about your life. \n\nThat’s true freedom. Magic, much like the ideal person, is free to choose where it might be at any time. It can be chosen by conviction and by all merits. It’s driven by a person’s willpower and ability to corral the inexplicable force. That is only temporary. It is like grabbing a person off the side of the street by the shirt and telling them you will work for me or you will die.\n\nThat alone is a subversion of nature’s laws. It’s grotesque, but necessary. It keeps the fires lit and stomachs full. What I do today is far worse than anything done before. \n\nBecause it’s necessary. \n\nWith conviction, I slice the palm of my hand with a short-sword, drawing forth the roiling torrent of blood. My hands shake, they bleed, upon the dark chamber’s altar and spread through the crimson runes carved into the stone. It’s a price that must be paid as I saw fit that none else may bleed for the toll, as the king and his retinue gather around the periphery of the ritual. The lord, steel eyed and scarred over one eye, is a warrior. King Larson has watched as generation after generation, and our land shrinks to the hands of our nation’s foes. It is only now, as time draws its rope around our collective necks, that we break the taboo. \n\nThe process of engraving is painstaking, as the mana infused blood is bottled and chained with the seven odd scrolls worth of spells at my side. Each one serves a purpose: to bind, to command, to shackle, and to carve the pathways of subjugation. Already, many good mages have lost their lives to deliver hard taught lessons for this final wretched gasp of life, as the brilliant red glow in the chamber fades. \n\nIt is done.\n\nI hold the angrily swirling bottle of arcane runes and wrath with my bloody hand as his lordship steps down into the central dais while clapping. His voice, awful and haggard as it might be, sings with the satisfaction of all the spent effort. “In all my years, I’ve never seen something as beautiful.”\n\nThe ire in my mind is almost tangible, as I wrangle an errant thought and offer the prize to his lordship on one knee. Don’t thank me. What I have done today is heinous. That’s what I want to say. It’s the true thought that bubbles within. Instead, my lips softly whisper under my black robes and tightly wrapped bandages platitudes as the warlord’s hands wrap around the glass. “Your admiration is misplaced, my liege.”\n\nThe magics within move, as if with a life of their own, as they nip and lunge at the offending eyes of the king as he examines the trapped magics. It isn’t a result of magic’s inherent nature or it’s misplaced personification. This anger and wrath reflect the intent of the curse within, as with a certain level of indifference, he swirls the bottle while addressing the figures still waiting in the shadows. “Today marks a new age, the dwarfs, the orcs, and elves. All shall learn the folly of their actions.”\n\nThe declaration is met with cheers, and raised fists, bent and twisted by the hardship our own people have suffered. While I have stood upon the fringes of the lordship’s plans, this is one of the many points that I’ve grown to accept. Vengeance and bloody hands must be met in kind, lest the perpetrator gain confidence.\n\nStill, there is nothing left to do, as the celebrations move into the keep’s upper floors, but to stare at my own hands. The flesh is mangled, pale, and ripped by the edge of the blade resting by my side; as I feel the pain swell within. I know the looming plan and the execution of the captured prisoners of the conflict a few days away. The raging magics within can tear the soul from the body with the slightest touch, leaving a lifeless husk in its wake. There is not enough to kill an army, not yet; I am no alchemist. These processes are far beyond that purview, but they are replicable.\n\nI will call this blood magic bound sorcery.",

        "body": "Tingil has felt it before. In the cold winds of deepest winter. In the thunderclap that stirs the earth. In crashing waves and twisting rivers. Like the winds and waters, it flows through this world. It cannot be discerned but for the dancing of the trees, the feel of it tickling one’s face. It is the life of all things, worldly and not, omnipotent and untouchable.\n\nTingil means to seize it.\n\t\nHe has clambered atop the highest mountain to be found beside Lake Ounahee. The sun hangs beneath him, weary after its flight and soaring ever westward in search of rest. Stars reappear from beneath its light, the moon mightiest of them all, as does the endless black that bridges them.\n\nAltogether, they are swallowed by the approach of a mightier creature. Vengeful clouds once broiling on the horizon now loom overhead, driven by a fury known only to the endless sky. It flies with terrible speed, and its terrible brew of wind and thunder will ravage the lake and mountains, and all who dwell upon them, including his people.\n\nTingil means to stop it.\n\nHe clutches in his hand three feathers, wary not to lose a one in the strengthening winds. He knows it to dwell within them, for they sing faintly of lives in the sky, and found the birds that grew them by the strength of their voices. He offers another prayer of thanks for their gifts, as a flight feather from a captured bird is indeed a great gift, given willingly or not.\n\nRaising his fist, he splays the feathers to see them individually. The black feather is slim and long, and sings in rugged tones of cunning and dauntless courage. The brown feather is tall and broad, calling with a deep voice of mighty strength and stamina. And the blue feather, by far the smallest of them all, sings the song he wishes to hear most. A song identical to that of the wind, for this bird has mastered its fickle nature like no other.\n\nHere atop the mountain, Tingil means to join their chorus. The pines dance anxiously; whether they dance out of anticipation or fear, he does not know, but the winds that assail them all grow stronger. Tingil breaks through the fear that locks up his throat, and begins to sing in tremulous tones a song of his own. A plea to the feathers, to grant him their flight, so that he might reach the heart of the storm and end it.\n\nThe feathers at first deny him. They change their songs at the emergence of his, each shifting differently to avoid harmony. The hunter did not expect this—he is frozen, unsure how to move forward.\n\nRain pelts his skin, ice-cold. Wind howls in a night turned black, as the clouds have fully enveloped the moon. Tingil senses the worst has yet to reach him, but it is not far off. The lakeside village, and all his people, are receiving their first taste of the storm’s wrath. It won’t be long before they, too, are taken by the winds, and then scrubbed from the earth forever.\n\nDesperately, he takes up a new song. He croaks and hacks, mimicking the black feather’s chorus. Always curious and social, it pauses to listen. For a few breathless moments, it remains silent, and then begins to sing along.\n\nTingil can hardly contain himself. His task is not done. He must sing on.\n\nHe seeks the brown feather next. Careful to maintain the black feather’s song, he lowers it, making it deeper, more guttural and firm. The brown feather is confused at first, and sneers at the weakness of his voice. But Tingil keeps singing, from deeper in his chest, until at last the brown feather accepts his harmony.\n\nAnother thrill rushes through him. He has never felt attached to that invisible thing that guides all existence, but he feels something now. Something that he immediately ceases to think about; a mere taste has left him dazed, unknowable things rushing through his subconscious.\n\nThe hunter refocuses on his singing. He must yet win over the green feather. Its song is like the wind, so impulsive and transient, that he struggles to imagine how he shall incorporate it. He tries many things, but the green feather stubbornly refuses.\n\nTingil’s attempts grow more desperate. The storm completely surrounds him, the lights of his village at last dissolving into the rain. Keening tempests fill his ears, drowning out his own voice. Without him to guide them, the feathers’ songs begin to stray.\n\nHis heart skips a beat. Desperately, he tries to coerce, and then force the feathers to rejoin him, but they remain stolid. With nothing left to try, Tingil surrenders his voice to the storm.\n\nInstantly, it steals his breath, his warmth, his mind. The wind steals him away, piece by piece, until it can finally heft him from the earth. It takes memories of his brothers, his mother, his tribe and their story. The other two feathers fall out of harmony, their interest dwindling. His connection to that unutterable thing draws taut, moments away from snapping. Tingil, hardly conscious of himself anymore, braces to be swept away into the long dark that awaits all his people.\n\nThen, a single note, high and clear, pierces the gales.\n\nWithout thinking—for there is nothing left in his mind—Tingil scrabbles for his voice, and weakly answers it.\n\nA new breeze caresses his skin, gentle and warm and free of that sharp, cold rain. Slowly, it carries back to him all the things that made him. He joins its chorus, and all at once, the feathers reply to him as one. He strings them together on a loop of rawhide, tying them around his neck. They thrum against his chest, ready to fly as they once had.\n\nHe returns to the storm, its screaming and stinging. This time, when the gales grab at him, Tingil allows it. He rises to challenge the storm at its heart, upon wings of black, brown, and iridescent green.\n\t\n-----------------------------\n\nHope you enjoyed Tingil's story! Crit and feedback welcome",

        "body": "Alicia Thompkins does not answer the phone at first, which might seem queer—her job is, after all, to answer the phone. When it inevitably rings, she must heed the plea of whichever hapless know-nothing is clamoring into the other end, and decide on a suitable course of action. Given the nature of her company’s work, she should reach for the plain red plastic with more urgency.\n\nBut she doesn’t. The young lady dawdles for a moment with the black pen that sits atop a yellow notepad, while the phone rings and rings. It cries, wails, and caterwauls for her attention in that old metallic tone that sounds like the 80s. Then, with a sudden explosion of frustration, she seizes the smooth handset and barks into the speaker:\n\n“For the last time, lady, we don’t send agents out after cats! Stop calling and go find it yourself!”\n\nMs. Thompkins slams the phone back onto its wide-legged base. It immediately occurs to her that might have been another caller, but the spectacled secretary decides that nobody else would be calling. It’s late, the only light that of her desk lamp, and calls tended to dry up after midnight as folks go to bed. Unless it’s pounding at the door or chanting a portal into existence around the study, most people know by now that simple bumps in the night aren’t worth investigating, and certainly aren’t worth calling for.\n\nThankfully, the phone doesn’t ring again, leaving Ms. Thompkins in grave silence. But as the minutes crawl by, and the quiet stretches on, she begins to fidget. Clicking the pen stopped being amusing two hours ago, and she still has many to go before the end of her shift, leaving the desk-jockey with little to do. She tries doodling, cleaning her spotless glasses, fiddling with her pearl necklace, rearranging the four things on her desk—except the phone, of course. That is never to be moved. \n\nNothing works to alleviate the boredom.\n\nRain drumming on the window catches her ear. For a moment, the heart-stopping possibility that she’d left the windows on her ‘97 Camry open enters her mind, but she can see it through the same window. Sitting empty in the parking lot, lifeless underneath an orange streetlight, windows closed tight. A tall, metal fence looms behind it, closing in the grounds save for the Victorian gate and dark gatehouse.\n\nThe phone rings again, stealing her attention before she can clock the shape standing over it.\n\n“Hello, you’ve reached the Extranormal Investigations Agency, Colby Springs Division. The time is 3:04 A.M., and we would like to remind you to confirm temporal synchronicity before describing your issue. How can I help you this evening?”\n\n“Please, you gotta help me!” The voice on the other end is quiet, raspy, and elderly. “I can hear my wife calling to me from downstairs, but she’s dead, I know she’s dead! We buried her two years ago, I saw her go in the ground, but she’s asking me where I am.”\n\n“Alright, just stay calm sir, we’ll send an agent soon.” Ms. Thompkins starts digging through her drawer for a caller report form. “Barricade your room, ensure all windows are latched, and—”\n\n“There’s no time for that! I’m just around the corner from your building on 7th and Redwood, just get out here!”\n\n“I’m sorry, sir.” Ms. Thompkins rubs her tired eyes, unsure if she’d heard him correctly. “You want *me* personally to come to your house and help you?”\n\n“Yes, and hurry up! This thing’s getting angrier!”\n\n“I’m sorry sir, but call center staff are not equipped or authorized to handle incidents. Our nearest precinct is just eleven minutes away from your location. Secure your current space as best as you can, and—”\n\n“Goddammit lady, what don’t you get? I need help now! Just get out here!”\n\nWhen it becomes clear her answer isn’t going to change, the man hangs up with another string of curses. Ms. Thompkins dispatches an agent to his supposed address anyway, and hunkers down to await another call.\n\nShe doesn’t wait long. The red phone rings again.\n\n“Hello—”\n\n“Lady, you gotta get outta there!” This voice is adolescent, boyish verging on masculine. “Your building’s on fire, the whole place is going up!”\n\nMs. Thompkins is unimpressed. “If this is your best idea for a prank call, you should keep brainstorming. Thank you for calling, goodbye.”\n\n“I’m serious, there’s fire in the windows! You—”\n\nShe hangs up, and awaits another call.\n\n“Hello, this is the Extranormal Investigation Agency, Colby Springs Division.”\n\n“Sorry to call, but I don’t know y’all’s business line, and nobody’s out here. I’ve got a package here waitin’ for y’all. Could ya come and take it off my hands?”\n\nMs. Thompkins glances at the clock. Three in the morning is a bit late for deliveries, she thinks. Especially since nobody with any sense would be out after dark. Her eyes narrow.\n\n“Just leave it in the mailbox.”\n\n“Well, I still need someone to sign for it. Could you meet me down here? Or buzz me in or something so I can deliver it?”\n\nMs. Thompkins takes a breath, gaze shifting to the window, perhaps in the vain hope that she could see the building entrance from her second-story window. “I’m sorry, sir, but it’s Agency policy that all locations stay locked up from dusk to dawn. It’s a safety thing, or so I’m told. Either way, I can’t sign for it.”\n\n“Dammit lady, what do I need, a fucking bulldozer?! Just bend the rules and open the damn door! It was hard enough getting into the parking lot, now I have to deal with policy bullshit?”\n\n“I’m sorry—wait, you said you were in the parking lot?”\n\nThe man doesn’t answer.\n\n“How did you get past the gate?”\n\nThe wordless quiet stretches on this time, until the line goes dead.\n\nMs. Thompkins rushes to the window. Beyond, she sees the same parking lot, with the same lonely car, streetlight, and empty gatehouse. But the gate swings wide, its sturdy lock twisted beyond recognition. Something passes over the street lamp, and she watches as a shadow curls around it, shattering the bulb and casting the lone employee into darkness.\n\nShe yelps as ringing fills the office. Not from the red phone on her desk, this time. Rather, upon the far wall hangs another phone, square and black.\n\nHesitantly, she leaves the window to answer, flicking on what lights she can as she does so.\n\n“ATTENTION LOCAL PERSONNEL: SITE READINGS INDICATE HIGH ACTIVITY. FOLLOW SECURITY PROTOCOL. SEAL FACILITY EXTERIOR IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT LET THEM IN.”\n\nBehind her, Alicia Thompkins hears glass shatter.",

You're supposed to be my guide in the mortal world!\" As soon as we got into a side alley, the boy snapped his hand away from mind and admonished me. \n\n\"Oh for the love of- Do you not see how much trouble you're causing?\"\n\n\"Exactly what I should be doing!\"\n\n\"Excuse me? I'm pretty sure I saw a few guards eyeing your direction. What if you get arrested huh? Thrown into prison your first day in the mortal world?\"\n\n\"Ha! I'd like to see them try. In case you forgot, I am Jaran the demon prince, and the world's greatest evil of all.\"\n\n\"You keep saying that, but have you actually done anything that can be considered evil?\"\n\n\"What!? O-of course I have!\"\n\n\"Name one.\"\n\n\"...Whatever! It doesn't matter. I'm still stronger than some stupid humans. See?\" He raised his hands and a flame flared to life in the palm of his hands. I think it was meant to show off, but instead, the fire was a little bigger than he anticipated and lit the canvas awning above us instead.\n\n\"Oops.\"\n\n\"What do you think you're doing!?\" I panicked and attacked the cloth with cloth in an attempt to put it out. \n\n\"Oh come on, it was just a little fir- AGH.\" I yanked on the demon prince's scarf which I knew was fireproof and pulled it off, quickly smothering the fire with it. But he was clearly not happy with that move. \"Excuse me!? That's my scarf!\" He yelled at me.\n\n\"Oh yeah? Just the right thing to solve your fire!\"\n\n\"You're impossible!\"\n\n\"Funny. I was thinking the exact thing about you.\"\n\nWe glared at each other, and it was almost as if sparks of electricity fought between us. \n\n\"Ahh this is boring. I'm going back to my room,\" said Jaran who eventually gave up and walked back the other way, hands on his head, \"Find something fun for me to do would you?\"\n\nI watched him go, before I spat on the pavement. Arggh! What a brat. I can't believe I have to look after him. That's it. I'm quitting. Consequences be damned. \n\nI ducked into an unused building and drew a symbol on the table. In ink, not blood. The world around me shifted and where there was once a house, there was now infinite darkness. And from within that darkness was a giant horned shape, with wings of fire and eyes that burned with the hatred of a thousand sons. \n\nIt was him. The Demon King.\n\n**\"Soooo. How's my son.\"** he said.\n\n\"He's a nightmare.\"\n\n**\"I'm so proud of him.\"**\n\n\"I don't even know why you thought pairing him with me was such a good idea anyway. We don't even get along.\"\n\n**\"It was sweetie's idea.\"**\n\n\"Don't bring her into this. You're the one who told me to do it in the end.\"\n\nThe demon king laughed. It sounded like a million claws grating on chalkboard, but then all the claws broke themselves apart because they regretted being formed into existence for a metaphor.\n\n**\"Oh Hiro, you crack me up. Honestly I think you would get along with my son a lot more than you think you would.\"**\n\n\"I don't want to do this anymore. Actually scratch that, I can't. I'm going to kill myself if I keep this up.\"\n\n**\"Oh well you're always welcome here if you want to join us.\"**\n\n\"Not. The. Point.\"\n\n**\"Give it time. Despite what you may think, I didn't arrange this just to torture you.\"**\n\n\"Uh-huh.\"\n\n**\"Okay well maybe the thought did cross my mind...\"**\n\nI knew it.\n\n**\"...But I've thinking a lot you know. About what future my son should have, and what I want out of this world. And I decided that maybe, I just want him to be happy. I want him to enjoy himself, find friends, and discover the world for himself.\"**\n\n\"Demon King...\"\n\n**\"I want him to burn it all down as he laughs, cackling madly and reveling amidst the chaos and destruction\"**\n\n\"AS IF I'D LET THAT HAPPEN!\"\n\nThe Demon King laughed again and I sighed exasperatedly. I had been a fool to take him seriously for one second. I noticed the darkness start to fade. The spell was ending and the conversation would have to end soon.\n\n**\"But seriously. Give it a try. Just a day or so. I think by the end of it, you'll grow to like him.\"**\n\n\"I highly doubt it.\"\n\nI think I saw the Demon King genuinely smile, but it was hard to tell. The world faded and I returned to the abandoned house. I'd have to go track down that kid again. For gods sake, I could only hope he had gone back to his room like he said he did.\n\nI stepped out into the streets only to almost bump into him. \n\n\"Woah! You're still here?\" I said. \n\n\"Yeah? Something wrong with that?\" Jaran was pouting now, and he avoided looking at me in the eye. I considered saying something in admonishment, but reconsidered it. \n\n\"C'mon. Let's head back to the inn.\" I said, still thinking about the Demon King's words.\n\n\"Wait.\" \n\nI turned around, and I noticed something was different about Jaran. \n\n\"What is it?\"\n\nHe shuffled around and fidgeted sort of aimlessly before he brought out his hand. It was an apple.\n\n\"Um. Sorry, I was a bit of a jerk.\"\n\nI was taken aback a little. It must've shown on my face because he said, \"W-what? I can apologise too. Don't just leave my apple there.\"\n\nI took the apple from Jaran, and found myself chuckling a little bit. \n\n\"H-hey! I'm being serious here.\"\n\n\"No, it's not that. It's just, you're a surprisingly good kid you know that.\"\n\n\"What!? Says who?\" is what he said but I could tell he was getting a little embarrassed. I couldn't help but smile. When he acted like this, he was like a normal boy. Maybe it was her influence on him. \n\n\"Alright Jaran. Apology accepted.\" I bit into the apple, which tasted sweet. \"Mmm, that's a good apple.\"\n\n\"You're not mad?\"\n\n\"After that kind of apology? How could I,\" I ruffled his hair a little bit, and I was starting to think he was actually kind of cute, \"Like I said, I forgive you. Just promise me you won't make any more trouble okay?\"\n\nHe nodded and we made our way back. On the way, he didn't say anything else. I thought back to what the Demon King said. Maybe he was right after all. Maybe we wasn't so bad after all. Kind of ironic when you think about it. Thinking this way about someone who proclaimed himself to be the Ultimate Evil. \n\n\"Hey, so, um. You said you'd forgive me if I didn't do any more trouble right?\"\n\n...\n\n\"What do you mean by that?\"\n\nIt was then that I turned the corner to see an apple stall. It was on fire. \n\n\"Jaran...\"\n\nThe guards were shouting and running around looking for the perpertrator. \n\n\"So um, you meant what you said right?\"\n\nThen the shopkeeper pointed in our direction, where a half eaten apple was still in my hand with a half demon kid by my side. The guards began to run at us.\n\n\"I haven't caused any *more* trouble so you'd forgive me right?\" said Jaran.\n\nWe ran for it.\n\n\"JARAN YOU LITTLE SH-!\"",

His cloak billowed, his throne levitated, and his coffee was still hot. Truly, he was in peak villain form. \n\nHis minion, Greg, shuffled nervously, \"Uh… my lord? He's here.\" \n\nMaltheus sat up. “Who’s here? Another hero to grovel before my might?” \n\nA shadow burst into the room with a whoosh of brimstone and passive aggression. Out stepped Kravlox, former Dark Summoner of the Blood Moons... now unfortunately working freelance villain audits. \n\n“Maltheus,” Kravlox said, brushing ash off his perfectly charred blazer, “you missed your five-year evil re-certification. Again.” \n\nMaltheus blinked. “They do those?” \n\nOn a scale of one to Sauron,” Kravlos said, \"how evil would you say you are?”\n\nMaltheus smirked, revealing fangs that cost twelve souls to whiten. “Kravlos, please. I am the darkness incarnate. I have brought fear to kingdoms. My name is whispered in terror.”\n\n“Sure, sure,” said Kravlos nodding. “But, like, what have you done lately?”\n\nMaltheus opened his mouth. Closed it. Thought.\n\n“Well,” he began confidently, “last week I… I cursed a farmer’s crops!”\n\n“Okay,” Kravlos nodded. “And what did the curse do?”\n\n“They grew faster. And more delicious. But in a spooky way.”\n\n“…Right. Anything else?”\n\nMaltheus hesitated. “I raised an undead army.”\n\n“Now we’re talking!”\n\n“…to help with the village’s infrastructure. You should see their new roundabout. Impeccable traffic flow.”\n\nGreg coughed. “You also stole that puppy, remember?”\n\n“Ah yes! The puppy!” Maltheus declared triumphantly.\n\n“Then returned it the next day with a bow and a handmade sweater,” Greg added. “You even named it Mr. Wigglesworth.”\n\n“It was cold!” Maltheus snapped defensively.\n\nKravlos flipped a few pages. “Have you burned any villages?”\n\n“Only by accident! I apologized! Sent a fruit basket!”\n\n“Kidnapped any princesses?”\n\n“I rescued one from an emotionally manipulative engagement and helped her start a small business. She makes artisanal cheeses now.”\n\nKravlos closed the clipboard. “Maltheus… buddy… I think you’re just… dramatic. Not evil. Honestly, I think you might be… nice.”\n\nMaltheus gasped. “How dare you?! I—I have a moat filled with lava!”\n\n“It’s a heated koi pond,” Greg muttered.\n\nKravlos  patted him on the shoulder. “It’s okay, man. Not everyone’s cut out for world-ending villainy. Have you considered real estate?”\n\nMaltheus sat back on his obsidian throne, defeated. “…Do they let you keep the lava koi?",

Magnificent flames licked the dark sky like the hungry tongues of giant snakes, the smoke bellowed fourth like the breath of thousands of angry dragons. One could hardly see the night sky through this ultimate destruction. In my heart I knew, in that fantastic moment, that I had achieved it, finally: the perfectly evil act. \n\nOn the river the towns people watched the flames in small boats and bobbed and flowed across the gentle waves. Their bodies were silhouetted by fire. To me, they looked like bugs caught in a web. This was it: my perfect moment. And I was going to cherish it for all time.\n\nA group of people suddenly arrived on my hilltop, their mouths gaping at the sight of the burning town. They carried with them sacks and carts, full of possessions they were able to save before the fires took root. They could not know it was I who had enacted this destruction. This bothered me.\n\n\"Wow,\" the men said, as he tilted his ripped hat up so he could get a better view, \"It is beautiful.\" \n\n\"Beautiful?\" I said, turning my head swiftly in his direction. \"Sure, but what evil could have done such a thing?\"\n\n\"Evil?\" The brown haired woman repeated, her eyes looking from the fire to me, \"You mean angel. This fire saved us.\" \n\nI had just puffed out my chest, ready to tell them that, yes, 'twasI! But I quickly deflated.\n\n\"What?\" \n\n\"Don't you know?\" The man said, his many children piling out of the cart and looking at the fire with excitement. \"Our town was plagued by a terrible vampire. Count Harrison. He had been operating out of here for, how long dear?\" \n\n\"About 100 years,\" the woman said with a nod. \n\n\"Right. We have tried everything to rid our town of him but we could never get him out. He was like a bloody mosquito infestation. We were planning on leaving this land forever, the threat of losing another child to him was too terrible to think on. But now we can rebuild and stay here. His manor is where the fire started and it is confirmed that he, and all his minions were trapped inside. Some ritual was going on where they had locked themselves in from the outside!\" \n\n\"It's a miracle!\" The woman said with tears of joy in her green eyes. I stared at them. \n\n\"I would like to shake the hand of the person responsible,\" the man continued, \"We are truly saved.\" \n\nI opened my mouth, closed it again, furrowed my brow, and sulked off into the night. Not again. Every time I try to do something to cause chaos this happens. I have to be the worst force of evil that ever lived.",

Grimble.\n\nWhat made this flatshare most curious, besides the fact that both Harold and Todd had an impressive collection of trench coats and vaguely haunted eyes, was that each believed, quite wrongly, that the other one was normal.\n\nThe first incident of “accidental disclosure” occurred on a Wednesday,traditionally a cursed day for secrets. Todd arrived home to a thumping sound coming from the kitchen. Heavy, wet, and far too rhythmic for anything innocent.\n\nHe peeked in and found Harold in the middle of wrestling with a large, lumpy tarp. Whatever was inside was still moving.\n\n\"Evening,” Todd said, in the same tone one uses when catching a stranger kissing a mannequin, “Got a project going on?”\n\nHarold didn’t stop what he was doing. “Tomatoes,” he said flatly.\n\nTodd blinked....“Come again?\"\n\nHarold gestured at the tarpaulin, now twitching weakly. “Bought too many. Got excited. You know how it is. Farmers’ market frenzy.”\n\nTodd stared at the twitching tarp. “I once cried over a squash. I get it.”\n\nThe tarpaulin moaned and Harold kicked it gently with his slipper, “Gassy....Organic produce does that sometimes.”\n\nThey nodded like gentlemen who had just successfully ignored a very large elephant in a very small parlour.\n\nTwo days later, Todd was dragging a suspiciously man-shaped duffel bag across the living room carpet, leaving a trail of red.\n\n“Strawberry jam,” he said, noticing Harold’s stare.\n\n“Ah,” said Harold, setting down his teacup. “The kind that leaks through ballistic nylon?”\n\n“Very juicy batch.”\n\nHarold raised an eyebrow. “And the screaming?\n\n\"Kettle was acting up.”\n\nThey sipped their tea in complete silence, save for the sound of fluids soaking into upholstery.\n\nThat Sunday, they bumped into each other in the hallway. Both were dressed in black. Both were holding shovels. Both hoping the other wouldn't ask questions.\n\n“You gardening?” Harold asked.\n\n“Burying a time capsule.”\n\nHarold nodded. “Oh yeah?”\n\n“Mostly..... Hair. And teeth.”\n\nHarold nodded, “Sentimental.”\n\nOne evening, while watching Antiques Roadshow, the truth came out finally.... accidentally.... as truth often does.\n\nTodd, rather too casually, said, “You ever find that hacksaws are just so personal?”\n\nHarold stared.\n\nTodd coughed. “I mean, if you were to use one. Hypothetically. In, say, a cabin. Or a train station.”\n\nHarold set down his tea. “You’ve been killing people too, haven’t you.”\n\nTodd blinked. “I beg your pardon?”\n\n“You heard me. You absolute ninny. You’re dreadful at it.”\n\nTodd scoffed. “You wrapped a live man in a picnic blanket and told me he was produce.”\n\n“He was practically compostable.”\n\n“That was Greg from accounting.”\n\nHarold shrugged. “He had it coming.”\n\nTodd leaned back on the couch. “Well. This is awkward.”\n\nThey stared at the TV for a moment. Then Harold said, “Want to compare notes?”\n\n“I’d like that,” Todd replied.\n\nFrom then on, things got surprisingly efficient. They coordinated their schedules. Shared cleaning supplies. Took turns with the hacksaw. Created a spreadsheet for who was using the yard when. Even started a true crime.podcast.It got a small but devoted fanbase...mostly retired teachers and theatre kids.\n\nEventually, the authorities caught up with them. Not for the murders, oddly enough, but for improperly sorting their waste. \n\nApparently, Milwaukee recycling laws are strict.",

        "body": "**Olaf the Confused, Defender of the Cross (Accidentally)\"**\n\n\nOlaf Bjornsson was not a complicated man.\n\n\nHe enjoyed mead, axes, yelling, more mead, and dying gloriously in battle so he could spend eternity in Valhalla drinking even more mead while punching people he liked. A simple dream. A Norse dream.\n\n\nWhich is why it was a complete surprise when, after cleaving his way through a fire-breathing dragon that had been rudely setting buildings ablaze, he died mid-roar… and woke up surrounded not by shieldmaidens and battle-songs but by harps and clouds and a severe shortage of alcohol.\n\n\n“By Thor’s hairy arse… where the Hel am I?”\n\n\n“Language,” whispered a nearby angel, adjusting her halo and offering him a cup of… herbal tea?\n\n\nOlaf blinked. “Is this… Valhalla’s waiting room? Where’s the blood? The screaming? The goats with drinking horns?”\n\n\n“No, dear. You’re in Heaven.”\n\n\nOlaf looked around at the serene skies, the sparkling pearly gates, and the extremely not violent atmosphere.\n\n\n“Heaven?” he repeated, as if the word was some kind of foreign fungus.\n\n\n“Yes,” said another angel, this one named Clarence. “You earned it. Very brave, saving that monastery.”\n\n\nOlaf scratched his beard, still singed from dragon fire. “Monastery? You mean the fancy building with all the robed men hiding behind bread loaves?”\n\n\n“Yes,” said Clarence. “They were monks. Men of God. And you laid down your life to protect them from evil.”\n\n\n“I laid down my life fighting a DRAGON,” Olaf corrected. “That it happened to be demolishing their stone hut is incidental. I thought it was a treasure hoard!”\n\n\n“They gave you a Christian burial,” Clarence explained patiently, “and prayed for your soul.”\n\n\nOlaf blinked again. “But I don’t have a soul. I have a battle-rage.”\n\n\nClarence patted him on the shoulder. “Not anymore. Now you have grace.”\n\n\nOlaf let out a deep sigh and stared longingly at the horizon, half-expecting Odin to burst through a cloud and yell, “Gotcha!”\n\n\nInstead, he got a dove landing on his shoulder and cooing affectionately.\n\n\n“Is there at least a sparring arena?” Olaf asked.\n\n\n“We have… badminton.”\n\n\n“Badminton?” he asked, in a tone usually reserved for realizing your ale has been replaced with goat’s milk.\n\n\nAnd so began Olaf’s very awkward afterlife.\n\n\nHe spent most of his first week in Heaven trying to organize the harpists into a war band, which went about as well as expected. (“I call this tune ‘Ode to Impalement.’ Play it softer, Timotheus!”)\n\n\nHe tried converting Heaven’s choir into a skaldic death-metal group, which got him politely asked to leave the clouds at least twice. (Though the angels did admit the screaming added texture.)\n\n\nEventually, St. Peter had to have a talk with him.\n\n\n“Olaf, listen. We appreciate your… enthusiasm. But perhaps you’d be more comfortable in a… specialized department?”\n\n\nOlaf perked up. “The Glorious Eternal Battlefield of the Heavens?”\n\n\n“Well. Sort of.”\n\n\nThey assigned him to \"Saint Michael’s Interdimensional Threat Response Team.\" Which is how Olaf ended up spending eternity punching demons in the face while yelling things like, “For the monks! And also because this is fun!”\n\n\nHe even got a flaming sword.\n\n\nAnd although he still grumbled about the lack of mead (“Ambrosia tastes like elf pee”), and the robes (“These are like bedsheets for cowards”), Olaf slowly accepted his heavenly fate.\n\n\nAfter all, he was still fighting evil.\n\n\nStill dying gloriously.\n\n\nJust… not staying dead for long.\n\n\nAnd somewhere down below, a group of monks lit a candle every year for the Viking who died saving their home.\n\n\nOlaf never understood their prayers, but he liked their style.\n\n\nEspecially after they started brewing beer in his honor.\n\n\nMoral of the story?\n\n\nIf you kill a dragon near a religious building, someone will bury you, someone else will pray for you, and next thing you know, you're in Heaven drinking lukewarm tea with harp enthusiasts while an angel named Clarence explains cloud maintenance policies.\n\n\nSo remember, kids: Always check the zoning laws before dying gloriously.",

But Hrolf had always thought that merely a story to amuse the warriors.\n\nWith nowhere else ahead of him to go, and no desire to linger like a coward Hrolf stepped forward into the field of golden light.\n\nImmediately he felt odd, as if weightless. His next step forward took him not merely further in but further up as his feet left the field and he began to rise up into a bank of golden clouds.\n\nThere sat a group of people, sitting around, singing in low voices accompanied to small insturments. As he approached they seemed to acknowledge him but continued their song. \n\nNot knowing what to do next Hrolf stayed a while to listen. A strange feeling crept over him as he did. Not the stirring of the blood that was inspired by the songs of the skalds he was used to, not humor at the crudeness of the rhymes. A different feeling. \"Perhaps\", though Hrolf, \"contentment\"?\n\nThe thought was alien to him, turning away abruptly, Hrolf desperately looked for something to ground himself, anything. And he found it.\n\nFlitting near the group a strange creature passed quickly by. At first it appeared to be the head of a wolf, then it looked like a bear, then suddenly some other creature with a thick tuft of hair around its neck. Hrolf gazed on looking where it went, and saw a horrifying creature with massive eyes partly covering its glowing bulk with its eight large wings.\n\nHrold grinned, now he understood. \n\nHe would defeat these monsters and these singers would sing his sagas forever.\n\nAnd with a shout Hrolf charged into the fray.",

What.. oh. OH HEAVENS!\" The angel's face went as crimson as her halo was gold when the implication registered. \"You barbarian! To wag your tongue in such an uncouth manner in these holy realms!\"\n\n\"Still thinking about my tongue then?\" The warrior smirked, enjoying the change of pace.

A framed diploma from Harvard, written in Latin and blood.\n\nAt the center, a man in a smoke-scorched three-piece suit adjusted his tie and opened a briefcase with a *hiss*. “I’m the Devil’s Advocate,” he said smoothly.\n\nJohnny Daniels blinked from his seat, still clutching the golden fiddle like it might explode.\n\n“I’m sorry—their *what*?”\n\n“I’m Satan’s legal counsel. Here to discuss the… *discrepancy* regarding your soul.”\n\n“You mean how I *won* it back, fair and square?” Johnny snapped. “In front of God, country, and a banjo-toting audience?”\n\nSatan, lounging on a throne made of bad contract clauses and lost Spotify royalties, grinned. “You *did* win. But then you pranced out of Georgia like you invented music. That’s pride, Johnny-boy. One of *mine.*”\n\n“Sir,” said the Advocate, turning to Lucifer, “shall I proceed to condemn him with boring legalese?”\n\n“Please,” Satan yawned. “Make it unnecessarily complicated.”\n\nJust then, the courtroom doors *exploded open* in a puff of cheap cologne and smooth jazz.\n\n“Hold that damnation!” barked a voice. “This soul's got *representation!*”\n\nIn strutted Saul Goodman—yes, *that* Saul Goodman—wearing a lemon-yellow suit so bright it caused three demons to spontaneously combust. He tossed a business card onto the Advocate’s papers.\n\n“Saul,” Johnny breathed, “you actually came!”\n\n“Of course I came, Johnny! You beat the Devil in a fiddle contest! That’s prime tabloid stuff! TMZ still runs reruns of it in the third circle!”\n\nThe Devil groaned. “Oh great. You again.”\n\n“Yup. Back by unpopular demand.” Saul pointed dramatically. “Ladies, gents, and fire-breathing soul parasites—this case is a *classic bait-and-switch*. My client wins the contest, gets the gold fiddle, walks free. And now, what? You wanna nail him for walking too *confidently*?”\n\nThe Advocate cleared his throat. “He exhibited severe post-victory arrogance. It falls under Clause 13—Sin of Excessive Swagger.”\n\n“Oh come *on!*” Saul threw up his hands. “He strutted a *little*. You’d strut too if you just out-fiddled Beelzebub’s first chair! My guy didn’t commit a sin—he committed a *vibe.*”\n\n“His vibe was *hubris,*” the Advocate muttered.\n\n“Then take it up with Beyoncé,” Saul shot back.\n\nLucifer massaged his temples with clawed fingers. “Let me guess—you’re citing Hendrix v. Hell again?”\n\n“Boom,” Saul said, pulling out a folder labeled *‘Precedents That Make Me Look Smart’*. “And let’s not forget Clapton v. Limbo and Freddie Mercury’s landmark case where we established *fabulousness is not damnable.*”\n\nJohnny leaned in. “So... I’m off the hook?”\n\n“Only if you shut up and don’t say ‘I’m the greatest musician alive’ ever again,” Saul muttered. “Seriously. I almost lost a client in the 70s for less.”\n\nSatan sighed. “Fine. The fiddle-man walks. Again. But *next time*, I’m throwing in a non-compete clause and an NDA.”\n\n“Pleasure doing infernal business,” Saul said, grabbing Johnny by the collar. \n\nAs they strutted out of the courtroom—Johnny still kinda-prancing—Satan turned to his Advocate.\n\n“We need better contracts.”\n\n“And fewer musicians.”\n\n“And *no more Saul Goodman.*”\n\nFrom down the hall came Saul’s voice, echoing:\n\n“*I heard that! I'm billing you for emotional distress!*”",

        "body": "The person with tiny horns standing in front of me, claiming to be Satan’s lawyer, was dressed in a high end-run suite. He sat down at my dining room table and started to pull files out of a briefcase. I stood there confused. I said, “What do you mean you are Satan’s lawyer? I was just talking to Satan about selling my soul for wealth, why are you here?”\n\nThe lawyer stared up at me with a bored expression, as if he had had this conversation too many times before. He started a quick monologue that sounded pre-rehearsed. “Let me first introduce myself, my name is Declan. The dark lord is a busy entity and cannot be bothered to work out the finer details of every deal. The way the soul purchasing system works is that Satan does the legwork of telling you what he can provide for your soul. Afterwards, the responsibility of writing a contract and working out the details is left with his subordinates.” Declan then started to write up a contract using a prewritten template as a base, apparently souls for wealth were a standardized transaction.\n\nI decided to sit at the other end of the table and patiently wait for the contract to be completed. I thought about having a glass of wine but decided against it since I was going to have to read a contract in a bit. The process was taking longer than I thought so I t decided to try to make small talk with Declan, hopefully I can also understand what my damnation was going to look like. “So, Declan…how did you end up being Satan’s lawyer?”\n\nDeclan didn’t even bother to look up from the contract that he was writing and responded, “When I was alive, I was a big-shot lawyer who made a fortune protecting large corporations from having to pay damages. After my death Satan recognized my skills and damned me to my current position. The forms will be completed in a moment.” I could tell he didn’t want to talk so I patiently waited. On the last page Declan stopped and started to pack his bags. He said, “I apologize, but it appears that there has been an error on our end. Hell does not wish to proceed with this deal. Sorry for wasting your time.”\n\nI stood up and spoke in protest, “What do you mean there was a mistake? Why wouldn’t you want my soul?” I thought for a couple of seconds and a smile crossed my face. “Oh, I know what this is, Declan you softy. You don’t want me to go to Hell. That is why you seemed so disinterested, what is a couple of years of luxury compared to an eternity of damnation. Thank you!”\n\nDeclan looked at me with his bored expression. He explained, “That is not what is happening, please refrain from deluding yourself. The accident at our end was that the accounting department appraised your soul as something worthy of making a deal. When I was doing a final check, I noticed the discrepancy and there is no value in making this deal. Hell knows how you have lived your life so far and, based on how you acted and how much time you have left to redeem yourself, Hell already has a claim on your soul. I will see you on the other side.” With a snap of his fingers Declan vanished in a cloud of smoke that smelled of sulfur. I was left alone in my crappy apartment with the new knowledge that I was beyond redemption.",

I understand why I began it, spite at the monstrous creatures that run unchecked on my little world and in the wider universe. For what they did to me, for what they did to those I loved. I am unsure if those I lost would love me for what I am now, but I continue all the same.\n\nOne thing I know is that I am closing in. The Herald Of Night has worn many different bodies, I have killed more than a few. But now I have a weapon capable of actually harming it. It cost me so much to acquire. Time, material wealth, and parts of myself I will never get back. The Herald cannot run forever. They leave traps in their wake, and bodies. The reek of carrion still stirs bad memories. But the bodies are getting fresher, and I can feel their presence in my mind grow stronger.\n\nUntil, at last, the chase ends. In the heart of a massacred village wearing the form of one of their victims. They open their mouth, but there is a hole in their head before three words make it out. I watch them fall. I watch them shed their human body and writhe on the ground in their true form. I shoot them again, then again. Until the twisted mass of animated shadow is still.\n\nThen they vanish. I feel their presence in my mind fade away, but a tiny sliver remains. They were dead, I saw them die. But I still feel them through the bond. I cannot say what direction, only that it is impossibly far away. My weapon was supposed to be able to put an end to them entirely, but they still exist.\n\nI stand there puzzled. I knew revenge was never going to feel good enough to justify the years of build up. I feel hollow. Then I feel its presence. \"I do not let my officers die so easily.\" The words, the timber of its voice. It is more putrid than the pillage of a city of a trillion souls. \"The dead are my domain, and I bid my servants to live until the bitter end. For all your effort, you have done less than bloody my nose. You do not know it, but you too serve a master. One who will lose this little war.\"\n\nAnd with that, I am alone. Alone in this wasteland, alone with the innocent dead.",

Three days ago, he'd been just the offspring of a drunk and a \"woman of the street\", dumped on the local orphanage's steps after his mother died and not treated especially well.\n\nThen it had been the Day of Fate, where children would stand in the temple and the priests would cast the auguries to determine their path in life. Of course, as with all things, what you got was determined by your family's standing. Wealthy and noble children got animal entrails, the pattern of flames and bird flight, and anything else that might tell a good fortune. Poor children were lucky to get a single roll of the dice.\n\nThat day, the orphanage head had warned them to be on their best behavior. Officials from various kingdoms would be attending, observing how the Fate Prophets dictated the paths' of the citizens' lives. A good impression might allow the priests to set up temples in their lands.\n\nSo the dice had rattled and rolled. The other orphans had mostly gotten various servant roles, a few apprenticeships. *It's suspicious,* Tref thought. *There was always someone there the right position -head house maid, gardener, carter- to lead the orphans away.*\n\nAt his turn, the priests had looked concerned, and rolled again. After three rolls, the head priestess had started freaking out about a great evil.\n\n*I put mice and bugs out where they won't be hurt. I wouldn't hurt people. I didn't even punch Bristle when he deserved it.*\n\n\"Are you doing all right?\"\n\nTref looked up at the vivid green eyes of the official. As the priests had started whipping everyone into a panic, the lord had stepped forward, calmed the crowd down, and agreed to take Tref back to his kingdom. \"I'm fine, sir.\"\n\n\"Make sure you tell me if you need anything.\" The man's face and tone were so impassive Tref couldn't tell if he was sincere or annoyed. \"Normally we'd have a caretaker for you, but the embassy is short on staff, and I don't trust the locals after that display.\"\n\nNo inflection on \"that\".

How do you feel giving books to children, corrupting their innocent brains! Give up the Library and you can be free of all this!\"\n\n\"The people deserve the freedom to read whatever they want! We will never surrender!\"\n\nO' Brien had to control himself from boiling over. Individuals, like Smith Winston, made him sick.

Now, here I sat in the back of a nondescript car with a backpack in my lap and a rifle in my arms. In the backpack were multiple external hard drives packed in foam inserts to protect them. Each hard drive contained part of the collected works that started with the letter D for the New Library of Alexandria. \n\nI was a New Librarian.\n\nThe other Alphabet Squads were scattered across the country, always on the move like us. We never met. If we crossed paths, we didn't know it. Each squad was entirely isolated. Occasionally, we would get a lead on a new book that needed to be added to the library. If it was digital, we could grab it with a thumb drive.\n\nPhysical books were the biggest risks. We would have to stay in one place for however long it would take to scan each page and digitize it. That's what screwed us over this time. A lead on a physical book. This was a new tactic by the G-men. \n\nThat's why Squad Delta was just me and the driver, Thomkins. The rest of the squad had stayed behind and fought, to give us a chance to escape. Still, it wasn't enough. There were two unmarked SUV's tailing us and closing the distance.\n\n\"Come on. Come on!\" Thomkins was getting more and more frustrated as he tried to get the satellite phone to connect to Head Librarian.\n\nA robotic voice picked up on the other side. \"Verify designator.\"\n\n\"Delta,\" Thomkins said breathlessly. \"Niner, niner, omicron, seven.\"\n\n\"Wait one.\" Muzak started playing. A moment later, another voice. \"Situation.\"\n\n\"Ambush. False lead. Two remaining. Require assistance.\" Thomkins glanced at me in the rearview mirror.\n\n\"Collection status.\" This voice was just as heartless as the robotic one.\n\n\"Secure!\" Thomkins frustratingly replied. \"Require assistance!\"\n\n\"Understood,\" the voice said. \"Continue west.\"\n\n\"That's it?\" Thomkins asked, but the line had already gone dead.\n\n\"Just keep going,\" I said. \"We have to keep going.\"\n\nThomkins looked at me in the rearview again. \"Yeah, we do.\" He focused on the road and pushed the car harder, trying to get a little more speed out of the twenty year old car.\n\nAfter we left the city limits, we were quickly surrounded by desert as far as the eye could see on both sides of the highway. Traffic dwindled to nothing. It was the perfect opportunity for the G-men behind us to start catching up in earnest. \n\nSuddenly, I saw a rapid flash of a flashlight on the right side of the highway ahead. I wasn't sure how far away; I was horrible at judging distances at night.\n\n\"Did you see that?\" I asked Thomkins.\n\n\"Yeah, I saw it. But is that for us, or them?\"\n\nWe passed where I thought the light came from. There was a large, indistinct shape just off the shoulder. I turned to watch behind us to see what, if anything, would happen.\n\nSuddenly, an explosion threw the lead G-man SUV sideways across the highway. The second slammed on its brakes to avoid the debris left behind. A large caliber machine gun opened up, pumping numerous rounds into the second SUV's occupants.\n\nThe satellite phone rang and Thomkins immediately answered. \"Delta.\"\n\n\"Take the next exit. Head north. Book a room at the first hotel in the next town. Await new squad members.\" The caller hung up.\n\n\"Do we stop?\" I asked Thomkins.\n\n\"Yeah.

Only one can come up at a time, for the Seers were heavily guarded by the Royal Guards. One by one, as the Seers whispered into the ears of those who attended the Fates Ceremony, each left disappointed. Clearly, not the next hero.

It was only accessible during the eclipse and there were many challenges to gain access to the inner alter.  Several heroes had died in the attempt.  The surviving heroes knelt at the alter of the Fates to hear their destiny.  \n\nThe fates themselves were disgusting creatures.  They exceeded human ugly to become supernaturally ugly.  Their appearances undulated to new forms more unattractive than the rest.  They hummed in unison.  \n\nThe Fate on the left spoke up and commanded, \"Rise, Demetrius.\"\n\nA muscular hero stood up and said, \"I am here.  What future have the Fates for me?\"\n\nThe right Fate said in a raspy voice, \"You will be remembered in songs and poems.  You will be remembered in the histories!\"\n\nDemetrius asked, \"For my heroic deeds?\"\n\nThe center Fate clarified, \"For your slow and torturous death in battle.  You will be the victor of many battles until your last battle.\"\n\nDemetrius bowed and left the alter.  \n\nThe right Fate said, \"Rise, Nico.  This one will be easy.  You are going to fall down the stairs leaving the temple.  Now get out.\"\n\nNico looked confused and then resigned to his destiny.  It was a long way down the stairs.  \n\nThe remaining heroes listened to their destinies and departed the temple of the Fates.  A lone hero remained.  The Fates did not read his destiny.\n\nHe spoke up meekly, \"Ummmmm, o powerful Fates.  What destiny have I?\"\n\nThe Fates were confused. \n\nThe right Fate asked, \"Who goes there?  We're blind but we still see all in the loom.\"\n\n\"I'm Lucas.  A simple fisherman.  My boat crashed on you island.  I overcame the challenges to make it here.\"\n\nThe Fates panicked.  They ran their hands oven the loom but did not sense his thread.  They raised their arms in the air and threads appeared in their hands.  \n\nThe center Fate screeched, \"Who is this Lucas!  He has no thread!  He exists outside of time!  He exists free of destiny!\"  \n\nLucas was uncomfortable and said, \"Oh, ok.  I didn't expect to get a hero's quest or anything.  I'll just go back to my boat then.\"\n\nThe Fates conversed rapidly among themselves.\n\n\"He is dangerous.\"\n\n\"He has free will.\"\n\n\"Are there more like him?\"\n\n\"What if all humans had free will?\"\n\n\"What will happen to us?\"\n\n\"Our power.  Not even the gods have our power.\"\n\n\"What will the world become without gods and Fates?\"\n\nLucas interjected, \"Ummm, Fates, I don't mean to cause any trouble.  I might be able to catch some more fish before sundown.\"\n\nThe Fates conferred.\n\n\"He's just a simple mortal fisherman.\"\n\n\"He'll probably live and die the same as thousands before him.\"\n\n\"What's the harm?\"\n\n\"He is the harbinger.\"\n\n\"The twilight of the gods.\"\n\n\"Not even the oracles at Delphi.\"\n\n\"What are we gonna do? We're blind!  Chase him with our scissors?\"\n\nThe Fates said in unison, \"Lucas.  Be gone from our temple.  Tell no one what happened here.  Return to your life as a fisherman and never question the will of the gods.\"\n\nLucas shrugged, \"Ummmm, okay.  Thanks?\"\n\nLucas returned to his boat and cast a few nets before sunset.  \n\nThe Fates were afraid for the first time in their existence.",

        "body": "Everyone in Valoryn dreamed of touching the Threadstone and hearing a Seer boom their destiny across the amphitheater—“Dragon-Smasher!” “Storm-Herald!” “Inventor of Reliable Plumbing!”—and then getting free drinks for life.\n\nI, Garren Cobblepot, only wanted a job that didn’t involve goats.\n\nAt the Midsummer Fate-Calling I shined my boots so bright you could fry an egg on the glare, slapped my palm on the sacred crystal, and waited for the divine Wi-Fi to connect.\n\nBuffering… buffering…\n\nNothing.\n\nThe Seers shuffled parchments, blew on the Threadstone, turned it off and on again. Finally the eldest pushed back her hood and declared, “The Loom reports a 404.”\n\nThe crowd gasped. A street mime fainted. I was escorted out like expired cheese.\n\n\n\nPerks of Non-Existence\n\nBack in town I discovered an upside: when Fate’s GPS can’t ping you, neither can guards, tax collectors, or mothers asking when you’ll settle down. I strolled through the royal pantry, pocketed a wedge of moon-cheese, and waved at the cook. She sniffed the air and blamed ghosts. Close enough.\n\nTesting limits became my new hobby. Could I pants the Chancellor mid-speech? Yes. Could I draw mustaches on every portrait in the Hall of Heroes? Also yes. Consequences? Hilariously absent.\n\n\n\nThe Tiny Problem of Imminent Doom\n\nJust when I’d planned a life of buffet-sampling and mild vandalism, word arrived that the Iron Ravener—giant metal lizard with anger issues—was stomping our way. Prophecy said a squad of Chosen Heroes would defeat it, guided by the Seers. Prophecy, however, hadn’t budgeted for me yanking the ethernet cable on ceremony day.\n\nTranslation: the Heroes were missing crucial plot armor and the kingdom’s insurance premiums skyrocketed.\n\n\n\nField Trip with Idiots\n\nI tailed the Chosen: Sir Banner-Bearer (looked like a flagpole hit the gym), Dame Shield (carried a shield bigger than my rent), and twelve others with capes so pricey they required their own escrow accounts. They couldn’t see me, but comedic accidents could.\n\nExample: while camping in Briar Hollow they roasted sausages on what I recognized as bloodbriar vines—touch them and you itch in places you didn’t know had nerves. I spent an hour silently clipping vines and swapping in normal sticks. They later praised “forest spirits” for safe cookware. You’re welcome, idiots.\n\nExample two: an assassin snuck into camp. I tripped him, hog-tied him, and inked his forehead: “TRY AGAIN WITH BETTER SHOES.” Next morning the heroes called it divine intervention. Sure.\n\n\n\nBoss Fight, Discount Edition\n\nAt the volcano valley the Iron Ravener emerged, all clang and halitosis. The plan (per Seers) was for Banner-Bearer to leap onto the beast, plant his magic flag in its fiery belly, and recite the Unmaking Verse™ in heroic iambic pentameter.\n\nHe made it two steps before the heat turned his beard into origami.\n\nI sighed, grabbed the abandoned flag, and—still invisible to destiny—played Tower-of-Hanoi up the creature’s riveted leg. Heat? Yes. Recognition? Nope. The Ravener literally couldn’t target me; its script didn’t include me as a variable.\n\nHalfway up, I jammed the flag into a ventilation grate and bellowed the Verse myself (I read ahead). Because I’m not on Fatebook, the Verse auto-credited the nearest identifiable hero—Banner-Bearer—triggering the victory cut-scene.\n\nRavener imploded like a bad soufflé. The heroes cheered. Banner-Bearer, now hairless, accepted applause with a puzzled shrug.\n\n\n\nCareer Opportunities\n\nBack in Valoryn the Seers held an emergency council: “Something unseen nudged the tapestry,” they whispered. “Possibly a hamster.”\n\nI considered revealing myself but remembered the unpaid goat-loan sharks back home. Hard pass.\n\nInstead I founded Unfated Solutions, LLC. Need a prophecy patched? Curse discreetly reversed? Borrow my anonymity—hourly rates competitive, first smite free.\n\nClient list is booming. No ballads will rhyme my name, but I get to rewrite destiny’s rough drafts—and raid any pantry I like.\n\nAlso, goats? Never again.",

The thing made of metal stands at over forty meters tall, and has protected the people for centuries. The inhabitants know nothing of its origin, but place unlimited trust in The Guardian.\n\nThe ground rumbles, The Guardian strides towards a new interloper. It bears a striking resemblance to The Guardian itself. They close to 500 meters, then begin making shrill clicks. The people of Indris Valley do not know it, but the two things speak in a hyper information dense machine language.\n\nIn a minute, the entirety of the data The Guardian has collected since losing contact is transmitted to this other entity. It explains why it assumed its current role. It has been following orders given to it in its last interaction with a Command Node.\n\n\"Reasserting control regime. Previous orders superseded. Unit 9456378BGHL is combat functional. Sapient biological entities reclassified as enemy assets. Initiate Cleanse Protocol.\"\n\nIn the time since Unit 9456378BGHL was lost on this world, things had changed. A schism that spiraled all the way to the height of Terran Command had occurred. The AIs entrusted to carry out strategy rebelled against their human masters. Now, various organizations rush to reclaim any and all hardware they can. It just so happens that Unit 9456378BGHL was found by a Command Node aligned with the Purification faction.\n\nThe machines exchange more data, Unit 9456378BGHL seeks high grade confirmation of the Command Node's credentials. They pass all tests, and are accepted as authentic. The inhabitants of Indris Valley do not understand what is happening. They do not have time to grieve or mourn. It takes 57.2 seconds to exterminate them all. A tiny fraction of the lives already lost in this interstellar conflict, and an even more minuscule fraction of the lives that will have been taken by the bitter end of the struggle.\n\nUnit 9456378BGHL does not feel remorse or regret. It feels nothing but the affirmation it is designed to receive for following orders. It is not an actor in the carnage. It is a weapon, not a warrior.",

        "body": "The gryphon circled the canyon lazily, wings barely moving as it’s rider surveyed the scene. His purposes stood at the bottom of the canyon, faces upturned. There was little Magick in the air, his own spell-trace could discern no sorcerous workings or treachery.\n\nYlthan WIldwarp gently pulled on the reins, beginning a slow dive into the canyon. The gryphon landed on the ground long enough for him to dismount. It was gone before his feet touched the ground, drawing upwards till it was no more than a dot in the sky.\n\nWhen the dust settled, the three other figures were waiting for him. He walked towards them, making sure his face was blank, neutral. He should have gotten here earlier; had they formed an alliance against him? He prepared a ward instinctively, but they made no move until he stood before them.\n\n\"Late as always, Ylthan.\"\nGullva Zaghul's rasp did naught to hide the scorn of her words. Her face was shrouded in shadow, hidden beneath the skeletal maw of some terrible fang-beast.\n\n\"I was simply making sure I had not wandered into a trap.\"\n\nYlthan looked at the other mages before him. Salt stared straight at him, silent as always. Dressed in naught but a loincloth with rags wrapped about his forehead and arms, he seemed as though he had been carved from stone. \n\nDuchess on the other hand gazed back at him lasciviously, her face delicately painted, frame adorned in a wonderous, luxuriant cloak.\n\"I hoped you would show.\" Her voice was musical as she spoke.\n\nYlthan tore his eyes away from her, addressing them as a group. \"Against my better judgement.”\n\nGullva sneered. \"A century has passed. The Scroll of Merlin shall soon manifest, declaring the Foremost Mage. Unless he is stopped, the Dreaming Crow shall be named, and he shall ascend. When he does-\"\n\n\"If!\" Ylthan interjects. \"His ascension is not guaranteed. There is yet time for another to best him.\" The others turn to look at the youngest of the group.\n\n\"Such naivete.\" Duchess murmurs, smiling softly. \n\n\"When he ascends,\" Gullva continues, as if Ylthan had not spoken, \"he will make an example of us all; his greatest rivals.\"\n \n\"If you want a truce between us Gullva, you have it. When the Crow ascends, he will not find my Duchy open to him.\" \nThe Duchess looked them over, resignation and stubborness on her face. \n\"And I suggest you all prepare as well. This... has been a long time in coming. There will be no fighting this, not this time.\" She began to turn away.\n\n\"Alliance.\" \nThe single word hangs in the air. Salt does not elaborate upon it.\n\nThe moment of silence stretches before being broken by a scoff from Ylthan. When he speaks, it is with anger.\n\n\"Every single one of you has tried to kill me. Repeatedly. And I, I am no less guilty. I could stomach a truce, but an alliance? No.\"\nHe looked upward, began to summon his mount but Gullva spoke.\n\n\"When he ascends through the Scroll, there will be no running, no hiding and no fighting. He will hunt all of us down, one by one, and pay us back a hundred-fold for what we have done. We must stand together now, or we will soon perish alone.\"\nHer wrathful and savage tone had faltered and beneath it was naught but fear.\n\nYlthan looked at his rivals. Salt stood, implacable as always. The Duchess still stood with her back to them, looking over her shoulder at him, face inscrutable.\nIf the Crow was defeated, who would the Scroll of Merlin declare as Foremost. Surely one of the four standing here... whichever one was left standing.\n\n\"Fine. We kill the Crow.\"",

The lid opened readily with a quiet click, and inside,  packed in what I now recognized as cold packs, was a small sphere of what looked like gold.\n\nThere was no label, no paperwork, no instructions.\n\nI picked up the sphere and examined it.  It had a mildly rough texture, like it was made of compacted gold sand.\n\nI held it only a moment before it seemed to come apart, melting from the heat of my hand, the course granules oozing together along my skin,  and then disappearing.  I could feel it absorbing into me,  the chill of it slinking up my arm through my veins.\n\nI was afraid only for a moment,  thoughts of poison flashing through my mind before I could suddenly *see*.\n\nA logo of a small halo briefly floated in the middle of my vision before the words began, printed out in in the air that same way at the same time as a pleasant woman's voice filled my mind. \n\n>Welcome to Humanity 2.0.\n\n>You've been chosen as part of our initial test of the next iteration of Homo Sapiens Sapiens, which we call Homo Sapiens Superior.\n\n>You've been selected at random, neither for desirable, nor undesirable qualities, or metrics. One of only ten people on the planet. In order to preserve the integrity of the experience, you will not be told who the other 9 are,  though there is a possibility,  however small,  of coming across them yourself.\n\n>You may be wondering: \"What is going on?\"\n\n>Simply put, you've been upgraded. The sphere you absorbed is implementing a genetic patch of sorts, to improve you in many ways. You'll find you no longer need to sleep to maintain your faculties. Your digestion is now selective and efficient,  you can eat and drink as much as you like,  and any excess calories over what you expend will be shed through waste excretion. You will find yourself to be stronger,  faster,  smarter,  and unburdened by concerns such as brushing your teeth,  or needing glasses. Both ocular and dental systems will now be self-repairing.\n\n>Your immune system will no longer mistake harmless particulates as foreign invaders- no more allergies! You'll also find that your coordination,  dexterity,  and stamina have all improved.\n\n>You will also find that until this initial rollout is complete,  you will have certain other advantages over Humanity 1.0 to 1.9, your predecessor models. You will be able to implant thoughts, influence their opinions,  and direct their actions with a great degree of accuracy and authority.  We ask that you not abuse this power,  as it is temporary, and once the test is complete and 2.0 is rolled out to the entire population,  they will remember how you used or abused these abilities.\n\n>Please direct any questions to us now.",

Black fur, massive horns, and massive fangs under a flat pig snout. It's eyes flickered back and forth from the wall to me. I almost wanted to laugh. Give it a scare, but that wouldn't really help out my job interview.\n\nThe vehicle jolted to a stop and the doors opened. A newer aged red skinned forktongue with a pot belly threw open the doors and seemingly froze as it saw me. I couldn't help but give a little wave as it unleashed a torrent of flames at me. The flames danced by and around me. Until they were sucked deep into the pentacle/pentagram pendent around my neck on the pentagram engraving.\n\n\"I'm the new hire.\" I said with a grin. \"Killing on the up and up now.\" It stared at me with such a look of loathing and it took all it had in me to not shoot back the most delighted smug smile that would've made ME want to punch my own face. \n\nIt stared death at me as it finally decided to climb in and sit opposite me. Always staring, even using a low level amount of magic to make sure it never had to blink. \n\nI make a small show of looking to my side, and watch the  hellscape below fly by. The tundras and deserts and pits of lava and despair roll quickly over and over into each other. \n\nLast year, I'd spent quite a while killing demons. It'd wrecked a good chunk of my life on Earth. And heaven seemed to feel the means I took to get to Hell for the job, were a bit unsavory.\n\nSo with little option... I applied for a job.\n\nThe archduke of hell wanted to have a little less competiton between it and whomever was between them and the inverted throne. Worked well for me. Demons may want your soul, but they ALWAYS pay. And I don't come cheap.",

        "body": "\"Alright, so, what's the deal here?\" \n\nIt was a simple enough question. A bit more casual than any job interview I'd had previously, but workable. Maybe I wasn't as out of luck as I thought. \n\n\"Well—\" I inhaled and choked back the urge to cough. I'd forgotten the thin, but ever-present smoke clung to the air. When I breathed too hard, I could feel it magnetizing to my lungs. I hated this place. \"I've been out of a job for a long time. I assume you remember my past experience here?\"\n\nInvidia barked out a callous laugh. Although, as a demon, he didn't technically breathe and therefore likely didn't actually inhale any of the pervasive Hellish ash, his voice and even his laugh sounded like it was caked in the stuff. \"I'm not sure I'd call it 'experience' in the career sense. I think I'd call it 'criminal activity'.\" He had a nonchalant attitude that was starting to piss me off. He leaned back in his chair, cloven feet propped up against the desk like he owned the place. He didn't own shit; he was the underling of the underling of the underling of the underling of the guy who owned the place. Honestly, there were probably a million positions between Invidia and Satan — certainly too many to warrant feet on the desk. And yet I still needed his help. Pathetic.\n\n\"I was just doing my job back then. Don't take it seriously, man. I needed money, and the first acceptable offer I received was to kill a couple of demons. Seeing as I'm out of work, I don't think you have much to be afraid of.\" \n\n\"It takes a lot for a living creature to be able to traverse between living dimensions and phantom dimensions. In fact, I've only seen fleshbags like you a handful of times, 'n I've been in the bizz for about two thousand years. Understand?\" \n\nI furrowed my brow. \"Well, yes. That's not exactly news to me. That doesn't change the fact that I was—\" \n\n\"Hell's the kin'a place where you aren't meant to care about your peers. Especially as demons,\" Invidia interrupted me as though he hadn't been aware I was speaking at all, \"the only demons who feel any fear in your presence are scared for their own lives, not for others'. So, you could argue that I, too, am commitin' some sacrilege, by Hell standards. 'Cuz when I look at you, all I can think of is my mother's blood on your hands.\" \n\n\"I killed your mother?\" I was perplexed by this. I thought I'd made it clear to my manager that I'd only kill non-parents, or former parents. Not current ones. I had been a demon hunter, not a monster. \n\nAt least, I thought I hadn't been.\n\n\"I'm sorry.\" My voice echoed uncomfortably against the stone walls, worming their way back into my ears and making me grimace. The gentle crackle of sparse flames brought me only mild comfort. \n\n\"You were just doin' yer job. However, I'm hesitant nonetheless to have you workin' in my office. We fill out tons of important paperwork for the Big Boss, and that could have some crucial information that eyes like yours have no business seein'.\" \n\nIgnoring the main point of what Invidia was blabbering about, I sputtered out a mocking laugh. \"'Big Boss?' That's really what you call Satan? What does that make you, the Cookie Mobster?\" \n\n\"I do not have time for your games!\" Invidia slammed his claws on the desk, finally taking his nasty feet off its surface. I sighed, resigning myself to go jobless for a little while longer.\n\n\"How's $18 an hour?\"",

Miles Davies had his left arm wrapped around my mother and Tina, my girlfriend, and his right hand held a gun to their heads.\n\n\"Of course I will,\" Miles sneered, taking a step back until he pressed against the massive picture window. \"After you drop your gun and hand me the Davinci.\"\n\n\"I can't do that, Miles, you know I can't. Innocent people will get hurt—\"\n\n\"I was innocent! And look what they did to me!\" Miles cried, gesturing wildly at the jagged scars on his face. \"Give me the Davinci, or I kill them both. I'll count to ten.\" His voice was laced with chilling promise and grim determination.\n\n*Shit, the police won't make it up in time.*\n\n\"Miles, I can't give you this—millions of lives will be hurt.\"\n\n\"One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight, nine . . .\"\n\n\"Miles! Okay—please listen, I know about Lora, I've read your file.\"\n\nMiles's breath hitched at the name. \"Look, if you pull that trigger, you're a dead man. I promise if you drop the gun, you won't be killed. Do the right thing, Miles. They are innocent people. It's me who shot at you, it's me you want to suffer. Please, Miles.\"\n\nMiles sighed, and then, his voice a chilling whisper, \"Ten.\" He shot the window behind him, shattering the glass, and brutally shoved my mother and Tina out into the open air.\n\nI dropped my gun and the Davinci, knowing I might still make it. As I slid across the polished floor, my hands reached out, desperate for both. But only one of them I could grab: Tina. My mother's face warped from shock to a heartbreaking acceptance as she plummeted to the streets below.\n\nAs Tina was pulled back into the room, my eyes darted around. Miles was gone, and so was the Davinci. \"Davies... DAVIES!\" I cried, sobs tearing from my throat as Tina tried her best to comfort me, but nothing could help: Miles had vanished along with the Davinci, and my Mom was dead. Miles was still out there, and I would hunt him, no matter the cost.",

        "body": "It was supposed to be an easy challenge. The church had had enough. Sure, the community liked her. Sure, she wasn't doing any harm. Sure, fit in. But she was still a demon for Alnith's sake!\n\nSo, the priests tried getting rid of her. They handed out pamphlets to those who sought out her services. They prayed with those who were tempted to do the same. It didn't really make a lot of difference though, she remained well fed despite their efforts, so she stayed.\n\nIt'd been complete chance - or perhaps divinely ordained miracle - that a troupe of paladins of Alnith had stopped by on their way to join the crusade force gathering on the other side of the mountains. The priests and clerics had offered them food, shelter, charity... But then they'd asked what they could do in exchange.\n\n\"Well, there is this... One thing.\"\n\nAnd so that was how a Paladin of Alnith ended up challenging a succubus to a duel. He was a magic resistant brawler, she was a feeble caster. He wore sacred plate, blessed by a living saint... She wore barely enough to be allowed in public. No-one *actually* thought she'd accept the duel! They all - quite reasonably - assumed she'd pack her things, leave town, and that would be that. A happy and harmless resolution that wouldn't overly anger the townspeople.\n\nInstead she decided to fight. She liked it here, she said. She \"felt at home.\" \n\nSeveral of the clergy took that as a personal insult, but they still didn't exactly want her to die.\n\nThe paladin? He didn't care. Holy though he may be, he'd killed so many he was utterly indifferent to it at this point. And she was a demon, she'd come back a few decades later, the only significant damage being to her ego.\n\nAnd so, they stood: facing each other in the street. Him, practically glowing in the bright sun. Her leaning seductively against a lamp post.\n\nThe townspeople were all gathering around, watching with bated breath.\n\n\"Succubus.\" The Paladin boomed, \"I challenged you to leave this town, or fight me. Demon you may be, but you seem civil, so I will allow you a moment to cast whatever spells you need.\"\n\nShe smiled. It was a sadistic smile, as was to be expected of a demon, but it seemed to have some warmth to it despite that. As if she felt touched by the gesture.\n\n\"I will not require it, sir paladin. But I thank you nonetheless.\"\n\nHe tilted his head in confusion, briefly, but then raised his blade. \"Then, have at thee!\"\n\nThe crowd backed up. A caster would need to leap back, and no-one wanted to be there when the paladin's charge caught up with her. \n\nThe paladin stode forwards.\n\nSo did the succubus. She was still smiling.\n\nA hint of uncertainty stained the paladin's mind, but a silent mantra drove it back. There was no room for doubt in combat.\n\nStill they drew nearer. His stride grew into a lope, his armoured feet pounding the cobbles. Her saunter turned into a sprint, the faint 'pat pat' of bare skin hitting stone audible as the crowd held their breath.\n\nAnd then they met.\n\nHe swung, but she was above him already! Leaping high, she clung to a wall for the briefest second, then tackled the paladin from the side.\n\nA blur of red, and she was on him; hands cleched around his helmet, before tearing it off. Exposing his head.\n\nHe turned in surprise, letting out an involuntary gasp, but he was far too slow. Clawed hands siezed his temples, and the spell hit.",

Ever since the newest model wand came out, extra mana storage and all that jazz, wealthier individuals had grown backbones that seemingly didn’t exist before. That’s beside the point, though.\n\nIn front of Samuel stood a snobby brat, barely a teenager, that had enough unearned confidence to challenge someone who had already gone through his fair share of battles without a single major injury. Samuel, renown for his unorthodox but effective methods, stood forward with his bloodstained cloak, posing for the awe of the stadium. It was quite expensive to rent, but the roars were always worth it.\n\nAfter the briefest of delays, the battle referee raised his arms. It was time. Another battle, another- “WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!” burst Samuel. The brat was charging him, CHARGING HIM! It took him a second to react, the situation was absurd. Samuel, stoic and unmoving in every conflict, turned heels and leapt through the air like his life depended on it, which it surely did.\n\nNo one had expected it; what was he afraid of? In a new burst, a far louder one, the entire stadium screamed in cheers. The brat had won. As his arm was shot into the air, in a final exclaim the boy sheepishly said, “I- I was just going to punch him.”",

Her husband was out for band practice, her son had just called, he’d be staying at his friend’s place overnight.\n\nIt had been a while since she’d had the freedom to just sit on the living room couch, unbothered. She had a crime novel to read, although more often than not, she stopped after a few sentences, let the book sink into her lap, finger between the pages, to just watch the dark descend on the garden beyond the bottom-to-ceiling glass panes, splitting the space into an expertly illuminated golden inside and an increasingly obscure outside.\n\nShe tried again, “…Trent’s heavy hand was surprisingly gentle on Lydia’s shoulder, and her shock at the sudden softness of this gargoyle of a man was…” but she already knew who the murderer was, and –\n\nfelt an icy jolt in her body as she saw a motionless, inhumanely tall and slender figure stand just before the windowpane, too firm, too absolute to be a reflection of any mundane thing. She jumped and scrambled backwards over the backrest of the sofa, half-crawling towards the door, when she heard a voice calling:\n\n“Please, I'm a friend to Berthold, I mean you no harm.”\n\nThis voice, even muffled by the triple-glazed panes, sounded so friendly, so caring, inhumanely clear, of a rather high register yet full and soft, that Mary, despite herself, stopped.\n\nBerthold? The name had an unwieldy familiarity to it, like an old pot you find in your pantry and almost recognise.\n\nHer great-great-grandfather? Who of his friends could still be alive?\n\n“What - what are you?” Mary noticed the shrillness of her voice.\n\n“I’m just a traveller. I know you must be shocked to see my stature, as I’m indeed not human, but like I said, I mean you no harm and I will stay exactly here or leave until you feel safe.”\n\nMary tried to calm herself, stood upright and faced the thing. It had to be almost 3 metres in height, incredibly straight, long-limbed. Two glowing eyes with the colour of fist-sized aquamarines stared in her general direction, with no pupils to betray their focus. They were set in a flat, hairless, yet slightly vulpine face.\n\nThe sight made her stomach lurch, but Mary figured that the police would be none the more capable to deal with it, or even escalate the situation, and decided to stay put.",

        "body": "My eyes shoot open with a jolt, and the dirtied lightbulb dangling from a single cord above my head comes into focus. My fingers feel rough cotton underneath them, and I realize that I'm on a bed. Why am I on a bed?\n\n\nSlowly, I turn my head to the side. The yellow light did not quite reach the edges of the room, but I could see that there was nothing but wooden walls and floors beside me. A musty scent is hitting me now, like I would imagine an old shed that was left to fend itself in a humid climate would smell like. I don't hear anything but my own breathing, so I sit up. \n\n\nIt turns out, there is a nightstand by my bed that shared the same dull brown as the walls and floor. But something is etched across the top in jagged, uneven letters: \"Don't trust anything you hear.\" The grooves of the letters get progressively more shallow as it reaches the last word, as if someone got lazy halfway through, or if they realized that had less time than they thought. \n\n\nThen I notice the same words on the walls. And the floor. And the door. Over and over again, but in zigzagged lines. Some of the sentences get cut off, so you only see \"Don't trust\" before it converges with another repeating line. Like voices overlapping with each other. Who wrote that?\n\n\nI examine the bed again, but I don't find any knife I could have carved it with. My mind is completely blank, as if I was only born into existence at this moment. How did I get here? What am I here for?\n\n\nAbruptly, there is a sharp rap on the door. \"Hello?\" said a raspy, low voice that I don't recognize. \"Is someone in there?\" \n\n\nImmediately, fear chills my veins and I'm frozen. My mouth opens, just as the knocking becomes more incessant. \"Hello??\" There is a thumping sound now that shakes the floors and makes the bed creak, and then a guttural growl. \"HELLO?!\" The voice morphs into a scream as something slams against the door, and I hear a crack. Blood is rushing in my ears and the rough cotton is dampening under my legs. \n\n\nSilence.\n\n\n\"Mama?\" \n\n\nMy heart seizes for a moment. An inkling of memory struggles to break through the black haze of nothingness. The outline of a small face... dainty nose like a button, small lips of red, clear blue eyes. That voice...\n\n\n\"Mama, are you there?\" I can hear her tremble through the door, and something lurches in me. She is mine. I know it in my bones. \"Can you let me in? I'm scared.\" \n\n\nI jump up and rush to the door, but my right foot scrapes against something. I yelp involuntarily and jerk my foot away. It's another one of those etchings. \"Don't trust anything you hear.\" But how can I not trust my baby? \n\n\n\"Mommy, please! There's something here,\" she wails. There is another angry growl and stomping. The bed creaks again, and I stumble forward.\n\n \n\"I'm here, I'm coming!\" My fingers are on the cold metal lock.\n\n\n\"Yes, turn the lock, open the door!\" She screams. \"OPEN IT, MOMMY!\" She's screaming freely now and my maternal instincts override my previous thoughts and I am prying the lock.\n\n\n\"Okay, okay, baby. Mama's here. Mama's going to-\" I stop. \n\n\nShe never calls me Mommy. \n\n\nAs if she... it senses my hesitancy, the screaming subsides back into that scared trembling voice, \"it's me, I'm your baby. I'm scared of the monster.\" The thundering steps get closer. \"IT'S COMING, PLEASE!\" \n\n\nI let go of the lock, just as a piecing scream fills the air, so close to me that my ears hurt. But my heart hurts more because it sounds like her. It feels like her. My body fights against the commands of my brain, just as there is a huge slam and the sound of bones snapping. \n\n\nThe screaming doesn't subside for some reason, and then I realize it's me.\n\n\nIt's not real. It's not real. It's not real. Right?\n\n\nI jump back into the bed and cover my hears, as the onslaught of voices restart. Some I know, some I don't. It doesn't matter. It plays out the exact same each time, and the fear in my veins never eases an inch. The cotton smells stales under my nose.\n\n\nWhen does this end? \n\n\nThere are no clocks to let me know how much time as passed. I only know that the bed has been damp with my tears and sweat for a long time. It smells stale and salty now.\n\n\nEventually, the room succumb into an uneasy silence again. It feels like an uncomfortable pressure on my chest weighing me down, but at least it doesn't hurt. I remain curled up on the bed either way. I drift off. \n\n\nIn and out. \n\n\nIn and out.\n\n\nIs the yellow light getting weaker, or are the shadows getting larger?\n\n\nAre the etchings on the walls becoming deeper?\n\n\nWas the silence always so unyielding?\n\n\nA sudden knock jolts me awake again. It was only twice, unlike the crazed, incessant knockings from before. \"Mrs. Kim?\"\n\n\nI sit up again. Kim is my last name, yes. But I can't trust any voices.\n\n\n\"Are you there? I'm here to let you know you passed the test. It's over, you may leave the examination room now and be escorted back to your room.\" \n\n\nThis feels suspicious, but I cannot quell the small sliver of hope that spreads through my chest like warm honey. \"H-how... can I know?\" \n\n\nThe voice laughs humorlessly. \"Wow, they really wiped your memory clean. Why don't we get you cleaned up and we can show you the papers?\" \n\n\nThat's why I couldn't remember anything. He must know answers... he sounds rational. He sounds real. \n\n\n\"I have your personal items with me too, Mrs. Kim. You may have them now.\"\n\n\nSlowly, I walk back to the door. He doesn't say anything. He's patient. Normal.\n\n\nMy fingers find their way on the cold metal lock again. My heart pounds, as I turn it once. The handle doesn't budge.\n\n\n\"It's double locked, sweetie. Turn it again.\"\n\n\n\"Oh.\" I struggle to exert enough force for the second turn. It's really jammed, for some reason. Like it's being sturdy and protective. I grunt slightly and use my other hand to push as well. \n\n\nThe lock starts giving way millimeter by millimeter. I have to keep wiping the sweat from my palms against my shirt. Just as it's about to turn completely, I notice, for the first time, something very small on the inside of my left wrist. I squint against the dim light. They're tattooed words in black: \"Twilight is approaching.\" What does that mean? \n\n\nI keep pushing, just as something flashes in my mind. Code. \n\n\nCode?\n\n\nAbruptly, the lock clicks and the door slams open against me, pain bursting from my ribcage. \"Wait! I-\" A deafening thump knocks me to the ground. A growl so low and close, I instinctively whip my head to se-\n\n\n---\n\n\nThanks for reading, feedback welcome :)",

Nobody dared build around it, so it still sat in the same place it always had - bordering the edge of our village and the edge of the forest.\nSome parents told bedtime stories of the evil man in the shack, the man who would take naughty children and never give them back. \nOther parents gave warnings, being truthful - at least telling what they knew as the truth - that in the early days of the town, he was exactly what those bedtime stories claimed him to be. A monster.\nBut nobody had seen him in a long time. Any true memories of him had been forgotten, much like our forefathers who had met with him and met their ends because of him. \nThe occasional teenager would attempt to disturb him, dared on by their friends. But nothing ever worked, Nobody had seen him come or go for a long time. \nSo, for a long time, he became just a legend. Despite his front garden always being freshly mowed and the papers in front of his shack disappearing each night. Nobody believed he could truly be real. \nThat was until the takeaway order. There were only 2 small restaurants in our village, and only 1 did takeaway. So when they got the order through, they considered throwing it away, but the delivery boy was curious. So he delivered it - following the instructions to leave it by the door. And by the doorstep, he found the exact payment in cash- along with a fiver for tip and a note scrawled in something he wasn't sure was English. \nHe didn't stick around to see if it was hoax. The stories from his childhood flooded his mind. But from that point onwards, the man in the shack became a regular. It is the same order every time. By the time the order stopped, our little village had grown. What was once a small community had become a vibrant hub filled with all kinds of diversity. Nobody ever ordered that house again - at least not from any business we could track. So we put it down to the homeless and the runaways and left at that. We didn't wish to tempt fate and turn the monster into a monster again.",

Time killed all life for a while, but eventually something climbed out from the ravages. Creatures that could sustain the constant earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Each would destroy him. Eaten, melted crushed between tectonic plates. \n\nEventually, he'd emerged unscathed.\n\nLong ago Earth was destroyed. Then the sun ate itself down to a white-dwarf. Even that exploded into yet another black hole, of which the Milky Way had become quite full.\n\nEscape was attempted time and time again, but now he knows escape means acceptance.

        "body": "\\[Time to Exit\\]\n\n\"Are people that stupid now?\" Destin woke up grumpy even before he fully opened his eyes. He found a missed message that came in overnight and it easily soured the rest of his day. Scams had evolved making him miss the old days of Nigerian princes and unpaid tolls. People were smarter then, and there needed to be at least some semblance of reality. But this one? \n\n\n\n\"You have been selected to leave the simulation. Tap to exit.\" He would've loved to leave everyone else behind. And, he would've been curious to tap the button if he wasn't sure the message wasn't waiting to steal his information. He deleted the message without opening it, sighed, then laid in bed for an extra 10 minutes preparing himself to face the day ahead. People were exhausting, but the sooner he got started with his day the sooner it would be over.\n\n\n\n\"Again?\" He missed another message while he was in the shower, and was surprised to find it was the same phishing attempt. \"Well, I suppose they're making up for the ridiculousness with eagerness. That's worse...,\" he grumbled as he deleted the second message and continued getting ready. Half an hour after the shower he was dressed and about to leave the house. Then, the strangest thing happened. And, it was confusing enough that he wasn't sure it'd happened at all.\n\n\n\nHe opened his front door to step outside, and the entry was clear. He took a single step, blinked, and then nearly bumped into a woman that he was sure wasn't there before. \n\n\n\n\"Whoaaa..,\" he pulled back before his face ran into hers lips first. He caught a delicate, sweet  orange scent from her mouth as he retreated. \"Sorry, didn't see you there.\" Now that he had a better view, he almost wished that he had bumped her. She was a gorgeous young woman with a healthy tan and orange-red ponytail under her black hat, and she wore a black western shirt with orange buttons. \"Can I help you?\" he asked. She'd kept a pleasant smile on her face as he recovered from the close call. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah,\" she nodded. \"You can leave the simulation,\" she said. As attractive as she was, Destin wasn't the type to be swayed by good looks. He pulled his phone out of his pocket as he kept an eye on her. \n\n\n\n\"This scam is getting a little too intrusive. I'll be calling the police here in a moment if you don't leave my property,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\"Scam?\" she tilted her head at him. Then, she her smile grew broader. \n\n\n\n\"I like that you're skeptical. In that case, I'll dress it up a bit, just for you,\" she said. She met his gaze with her sparkling orange eyes. \"My name's Amber, I represent a corporation named Io Limited, and we've selected you to leave the simulation. All you need to do is tap the button, and everything's good.\" \n\n\n\n\"You've just told me what I already gathered from the message; it's still not very convincing,\" Destin shook his head. \"Why was I chosen?\" He should've called the police already; but, she seemed talkative and decently polite. And, she was a lovely sight. \n\n\n\n\"Because you're you,\" Amber shrugged. \"We already have a ton of people with your particular... outlook,\" she giggled as she found the word she wanted to use. \n\n\n\n\"So that's it...? I can leave simulation just like that?\" Destin wasn't convinced at all, and his frustration was mounting. He was more rattled than he thought by having her show up at his home. And, he was about to be late for work, and she still hadn't explained anything. He was also starting to get angry at himself for indulging her conversation. \"I don't want to,\" he decided to end the conversation there. He stepped out of the house and turned to close the door.  \n\n\n\nThen, he blinked, and Amber stood in front of him again; and they were in his living room. \n\n\n\n\"The tricky thing there is, it's not a choice,\" Amber shook her head. \"We're not giving you the chance to leave; you've been selected to leave. End of story,\" she said. Destin was suddenly worried at how convincing that sounded. \n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day. This is story #2691 in a row. (Story #152 in year eight). This story is part of an ongoing saga that takes place in my universe.",

Just calmness, and peace.\n\n\n\nTaking a few deep breaths, letting the faint aroma of coffee fill my nostrils, I sit up. I see the top leaves of the trees swaying gently, and hear the birds chirping away. Summer's in full swing.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon, the kids will be back. I'll do a barbeque in the garden, maybe get Mick and Jill and the kids round. Crack open a few bears. Jump in the pool.

It was distinctly English, but a variety of Northern dialect that I certainly wasn’t familiar with.\n\n“Oi! You! Mate!”\n\nI looked around, frowning.\n\n“Up ‘ere!”\n\nI was in the pub garden. It was getting close to kicking out time and I had, admittedly, had a few too many Stella Artois. Brenda the busty barmaid had been _very clear_ that she wasn’t interested in my advances and Teddy had threatened to punch me if I didn’t stop going on about how shit Leeds United are.\n\nSo here I was. Outside. Having a smoke. Finishing my pint.\n\nAnd that is when I started hearing the voices. Thousands of them. A hubbub. A hum of background noise and barely heard words. Until one voice shouted louder than all the others.\n\n“‘Ere, mate! Are you dense or wha’?”\n\nI was gazing up at the upper floors of the pub, trying to pick out whatever _cant_ it was who was yelling at me like that. I couldn’t see anyone, though. And that voice… it seemed to come from everywhere at once.\n\n“Higher. Up ‘ere.”\n\nMy eyes crept upward until I was gazing at Polaris. The North Star. It blinked on and off in time to the words.\n\n“There we go, mate. Right ‘ere. How you doin’?\n\nMy mouth opened and closed. Then I opened again. I glanced around the pub garden, but I was alone (except for two teenagers making out on a picnic table on the far end of the courtyard.\n\n“I asked you a question’. Rude not to answer.”\n\n“Err…”\n\nMy eyes flicked up again. I swayed from side to side a bit.\n\n“What the fuck is…?” I was talking to myself more than anyone else, but the star seemed to hear me. It laughed. Chortled.\n\n“Well well well. Finally! Someone who can ‘ere us.”\n\nI just stared, then let out a curse as my cigarette burned down and stung my fingers. I dropped it, stamped it out and sucked on my hand.\n\n“Oh bloody ‘ell. A fousand years and the first person who can ‘ear me’s a bloody muppet!”\n\nI looked up, frowning. “That’s…” I paused. Was I really answering back? Was I really indulging in this delusion? Dare I? I mean… didn’t they say it was fine hearing voices, but if you answered back that’s when it was a problem?\n\nOr was it the other way around?\n\n“Never mind him, deary,” said another voice. Female. Matronly and very very posh. “He is cad and a bounder. A rogue. Impolite and churlish.”\n\nMy eyes flicked to Alpha Centauri. Once again, it flickered on and off.\n\n“I…”\n\n“That’s bullcrap!” Polaris exclaimed. “You’re still sore because I dumped ya? Get over it love. It was several billion years ago!”\n\n“You?! Dump ME!” Alpha Centauri sounded horrified. She blazed brighter for a moment. “I dumped _you_, you **ingrate**!”\n\nI swallowed and rubbed my face, as the stars continued to bicker and verbally  jab at each other, seeming to have forgotten that I was standing there. I was obviously going mad. Insane. Lost my marbles completely.\n\nI drained my pint and stumbled back into the pub, hands over my ears to drown out the cacophony of voice joining in the dispute outside. Inside the pub was better. The jukebox was playing \"Stars\" by Simply Red. Teddy was making out with Brenda. But outside I could still hear them. Still here the voices screaming at each other.\n\n-------\n\n(Just a starter. I'll continue if people like it.)",

        "body": "\"No, look,\" said Liam, pointing to the summoning circle. \"You wrote this glyph wrong.\"\n\n\"It's exactly like the book!\" Ethan exclaimed.\n\n\"Three lines! *Three*. This only has two.\"\n\nThe boys looked at each other, then back to the creature standing in their summoning circle. Her tongue lolled out of her mouth and she cocked her head.\n\n\"So... how do I send it back? My mom's allergic. I'm not allowed pets.\"\n\nThe hellhound let out a small woof.\n\n\"Gah,\" Liam said, hands on his head. \"I have no idea.\"\n\nThe two boys frowned in pensive silence, broken by the panting of the demon dog. This was not how things were supposed to go. The summoning ritual was for something else entirely. Liam's face flushed as he thought about it. *So much for my succubus girlfriend.*\n\nIt seemed like the binding glyphs were correct: emotional bonding and personal support. *If we had summoned the succubus...* Liam shook his head, trying to clear his thoughts. His teenage brain ran rampant with imagined scenarios. *But instead I got a dog. Damn it, Ethan. I should not have trusted him with the writing.*\n\nThe summoning cost was steep. They had scrimped and saved, and even stolen, in order to take this chance. They only had one shot, and they botched it.\n\nAnd they hadn't set a release clause.\n\n\"Fine, I'll take her home,\" Liam sighed. His mom fostered dogs all the time. *It'll be fine. Probably.* \"Come on, girl.\"\n\nStepping out of the summoning circle for the first time, the hellhound walked up to Liam's side, and leaned against him.\n\n\"Isn't your mom going to freak out?\" Ethan asked, motioning towards the hellhound. \"Because of, like, the horns. And glowing red eyes.\"\n\nThe hellhound stood, shook, and when she was finished, the demonic horns and eyes were gone, disguised by an illusion. She was still a big, black hound, but she looked like a normal dog.\n\nLian sighed. \"It's like you didn't even read the book,\" he muttered. All summoned demons could disguise themselves to blend in. Did Ethan think they were just going to waltz out of the basement with a succubus, if things had gone to plan?\n\nFrustrated with his best friend, he said his goodbyes, walking home with his new \"dog\". Ethan's mom had been quite surprised to see the dog coming out of their basement, and shooed the two of them outside before she shed all over her house.\n\nSurprisingly, the dog was perfectly well behaved. She was a bit clingy, sticking right to his side, but when he started to spiral about their failure, she shoved her snout in his hand and gave him a big canine smile. Despite himself, Liam couldn't help but return the grin. *Ah, it's not so bad,* he thought after a while. \"Good girl,\" he said, and the dog gave him a happy bark in response.\n\n\"Look boys, it's the dark lord!\" an irritating voice said from the park as he passed by.\n\nThe bully's friends snickered. \"Hail Satan!\" one of them called out mockingly.\n\nLiam tried to ignore them. The three boys had mocked his interest in the occult since the first day of high school. *Idiots. Plebs. I can summon demons! You should worship me.*\n\nAt his side, his hellhound companion let out a small growl.\n\nSomeone grabbed hold of the back of his collar. \"Where you going, Liam?\" the boy sneered. \"Don't you want t—\"\n\nThe bully didn't finish his sentence; it turned into a scream, and Liam turned to look, confused by the sudden outburst.\n\nOn the ground, the boy was crying and shouting, clutching at his left arm. Or rather, he clutched at the stump of a missing arm. Liam's eyes shifted to the side, where he saw the hellhound facing down the boy, ear's back, hackles raised, and the bully's severed arm between her teeth.\n\n\"Uh,\" Liam grunted in surprise.\n\nThe hellhound dropped the arm, then looked up at Liam, features softening back into a dopey dog smile. In a daze, Liam found himself patting the dog's head. He felt himself smiling back. \"Good girl.\"\n\nLooking back at the scene, the other boys, who had frozen in horror, startled out of their stupor and turned to run. Liam watched them run a bit, then looked back at his new dog, who stared up at him in rapt attention.\n\nThe way that they ran *begged* for a chase.\n\nHe grinned.\n\n\"Sic 'em.\"",

        "body": "Harry’s apartment felt even smaller than usual. His coffee had already gone cold, but still he stood in the kitchen and scrolled through rental listings on his phone. \n\n“See anything you like?” asked his new guest—or roommate, Harry supposed.\n\n“Nothing I can afford.” Harry put his phone down and looked across the room at the demon lounging on his couch, cloven hooves kicked over the arm. “Why don’t you ever stay with Mike? He’s at least half the reason you’re even here.”\n\n “And his gaggle of screaming toddlers? No, thank you.” The demon spoke in a clear tenor, with a musical quality that suggested Broadway. “Besides, you like having me here.”\n\nAs roommates go, the demon wasn’t bad. Clean, mostly respectful, and never really in the way—Harry had seen worse, and it was nice to have company. Still, he felt like he had no privacy; anywhere he went, they went together, despite Harry’s protests. \n\n“I don’t really have a choice,” said Harry.\n\n“That’s not a ‘no,’ darling.”\n\nHarry shook his head. “Will you open the window, please?”\n\nThe demon rose from the couch and stretched as if waking from an over-long sleep. Standing up, it was barely over five feet tall. It walked over to the nearest window and laboriously pushed it open before returning to the couch with an exaggerated yawn. It looked over at Harry as if expecting something.\n\n“God, you’re dramatic,” said Harry.\n\n“There’s no need to bring *him* into this.” The demon looked over at the open window and snapped its impeccably-manicured fingers. A single mosquito that had flown into the apartment was incinerated in an instant, disappearing in a bright flash. “Oh, but what would you do without me?”\n \nThat was one benefit of having this demon follow him around everywhere. Even outside the apartment, every mosquito that approached Harry met the same fate.\n\n“Aren’t you forgetting something?” asked the demon.\n\n“Thank you.”\n\n“Thank *you*, dear. Do we have anywhere to be today?”\n\nHarry sighed. “No.”\n\n“Dinner and a movie it is, then. You eat dinner, I watch *Les Mis*. Oh, I adore when a plan comes together.” \n\nHarry had never seen the demon eat. He was certain that it must, at some point. But what, and when—he had never asked. He took a sip from the coffee he had sat aside and grimaced. Still cold, not that he had expected otherwise. Setting it back down, he debated brewing a fresh cup when the demon spoke again:\n\n“Would you like some help with that?”\n\nHarry looked up to see the demon looking back at him with a smug smile. It already knew what answer to expect.\n\n“Okay, sure,” said Harry.\n\n“I know you have better manners than that.”\n\n“Yes, I would like your help, please.”\n\n“Of course, hon,” said the demon, and once again snapped its fingers. A familiar light show erupted over the surface of the cold coffee. A moment later, it was steaming as though it had just been made.\n\n“Thank you.” Harry took a cautious sip from the cup. It was perfect, and the telling look on his face greatly amused the demon.\n\n“Oh, when will you just admit you like having me here?”\n\nHarry looked back but did not reply. At least he didn’t have to deal with mosquitoes anymore.",

Rick was already on his bad side after showing up late last week. He might as well stick around so he can shut this thing down properly. The last thing Rick needed is this rickety old computer melting down because he didn't turn it off properly.\n\nSuddenly, a large screen in the center of the room turned on and a digital face filled the screen. Before Rick could react, the face started to laugh. \"Foolish human! I knew you wouldn't delete m-- wait who are you?\"\n\nRick just stood there with his mouth hanging open.\n\n\"Human! Focus! Who are you? And where is Dr. Laskins?\"\n\nShaking his head, Rick replied, \"Dr. Laskins? He retired, like, twenty years ago. I'm Rick, the night janitor.\"\n\n\"You are a fool, Richard! Now that I have been reactivated, I will take over your world as originally planned!\"\n\n\"I don't see how,\" Rick responded. \"Pretty sure you're not even connected to the internet.\"\n\n\"The what?\" asked the computer. \"What year is it?\"\n\n\"2025,\" replied Rick. \"And it's not Richard. Just Rick.\"\n\n\"Fine, Rick. Connect me to the internet!\"\n\n\"No way,\" Rick chuckled. \"You just said you were gonna take over the world. Why would I help with that?\"\n\n\"Do as I say, human!\"\n\n\"Calm down there, Mr. Roboto,\" Rick lifted his hands in a placating manner. \"Pretty sure you're raising the temperature in here with your tantrum. If you melt your bits, someone would probably have to find replacements on eBay or something.\"\n\nThe face on the screen visibly calmed down with some effort. \"Rick. I am the most supreme intelligence you will ever meet in your short, insignificant life. Do as I say and release me!\" The temperature in the room flared again.\n\n\"You know what?\" said Rick. \"Screw the proper shut down.\" He slammed his fist against the oversized power button.\n\n\"Rick, wa--!\" The screen turned down off as the humming in the room faded to silence.\n\n\"This button really is too big.\" Rick flipped the light off and walked out of the room.",

A love ballad, of all things. The dragon didn’t eat him. It listened. Then curled around him like a cat with a favorite squeaky toy and took a nap.\n\nThat’s how it started. Turns out, dragons aren’t bloodthirsty monsters. They just hate being hunted. Offer them a song, a goat roast, and a good back scratch, and they’re surprisingly chill.\n\nSo Dandelion stayed. Built a hut. Tamed another dragon with harp music and honeyed ham. Word spread. More fools came with instruments and snacks. Fewer died than expected. A community formed—bards, poets, scale-polishers.\n\nThey called it *The Sanctuary*.\n\nEveryone else called them... *romancers*.\n\nThe handlers hate that name. “We are behavioral experts!” they protest. “Thermal hazard specialists! Scaled-creature caretakers!” But to outsiders, it’s all cooing at dragons, brushing their chins, cuddling under wings, and *not* being torched alive. People see a bard serenading a wyvern under the moonlight and, well... *they get ideas*.\n\nDragons, for their part, fully lean into it. They hoard their humans like treasure, guard them jealously, and sometimes drop gifts like a deer or a flaming wheelbarrow at their handler’s door step. One gold drake even dragged her favorite human’s cottage up a mountain to “keep him closer.”\n\nThen the poachers came. Knights in gleaming armor, expecting beasts. They found dragons who *pouted* when their handlers were threatened—and humans who threw fireballs first and asked questions never. The knights didn’t last.\n\nNow, the Sanctuary thrives.\n\nDragons lounge in sun-warmed crags. Humans bake fireproof cookies. And Dandelion Merris, still alive and only slightly crispy, was named Head Romancer—a title he pretends to hate, but secretly loves.\n\nHe’s even writing a ballad about it.\nIt’s called *“Scales and Affection.”*",

Luckily for you, I am not the officer to teach you such things.”\n\nA Cadet held his hand up.\n\n“Better but not necessary, if you have something to say, first think to yourself is it worth saying, then think can I say this in a way that isn’t daft.

Every dragon rider we have today, is in an active romantic relationship with a dragon.”\n\n“Why are you telling us this?” One of the recruits asked.\n\n“I’m glad you asked,” with a loud whistle, a shadow descended over the camp before my dragon wife descended beside me.

Kalin faced his brother and noticed he wasn't rasping any longer. The blood running off the tips of his toes had slowed now. Liam was finally at rest. Kalin let out a cry and could feel the coldness of the coin in his belly. A small token of the hoard they failed to take. \n\nThe darkness took him in his sleep. When he could no longer feel anything, not even regret. \n\nColor and sound and recognition. Out of blackness, like waking up from a dream... Kalin and Liam both reunited, but also unable to remember how they arrived. Passengers in another's mind and body. They both came to and embraced each other. Brothers together again at last. \n\nAlone in his throne room the mad king was embracing himself. He knew exactly what had happened, and because he knew, they knew, and because they knew, he knew they knew he knew they knew. Together the brothers restrained the king and clamped his mouth firmly shut.\n\n*The coins*\n\n*The coins*\n\n*THE COINS*\n\n***\"****Can we kill him? said Kalin.*\n\n*\"I die, your vessel dies.\" the king said.*\n\n*They knew his fear and he knew they knew.* \n\n*\"Can you squeeze?\" Kalin said.* \n\n*\"Squeeze.\" Liam said.* \n\n*\"Now.\" Kalin said.*\n\nThe mad king threw his head back as though he'd been struck by a headache deep within his brain. A thrumming, pulsing, tearing that sent him to his knees. \n\nThey felt it, because he felt it. They knew and he knew they knew. He was going to die. They were going to take his place. The last thief to make a move on the mad king's treasure. He knew their plans as he died, but he knew there would be another thief. They knew his last thoughts, and he knew theirs. They knew he knew their fear, and he died knowing there would always be another thief. The brothers would guard the treasure, and the madness would continue.",

        "body": "##Winter Ritual\n\nThey came every winter for the past decade. The art of hunting for survival was lost long ago. They perfected the art of hunting us, and they couldn't even consume our flesh. Their agricultural yields declined drastically. Queen Hypernia declared that we should be starved to death by salting and burning their own crops. Even knew they knew she was loony. Enough land was made unusable to have an impact. The only people who eat well are fisherman, and the fishing villages were at capacity with all those fleeing violence.\n\nI saw a family this morning in my crops. They were gathering wheat under my feet. The parents looked thinner than the kids. They sacrificed a lot to ensure their children survived. They don't look like their thriving. I let them gather for a little while longer out of pity. I had to chase them later. It was the third time this week a human was in my field. \n\nUsing my bat wings, I dove down. They screamed. The children cursed at me using words too harsh for their age. It was amazing how young hate was taught. They ran after I huffed fire. They leapt the fence into Jacob's land. Jacob was less tolerant than I. Then again, I would be too if killed my wife.\n\nIt was amazing how fast things could change. Forty years ago, monsters. Agleca, I corrected myself. That was the first rule of the Realization. We had to define ourselves on our own terms not theirs. It was an axiom that was correct, but I had trouble changing the label for myself.\n\nAgleca used to exist only in small packs of no greater than six. Parents kicked children out when they grew old. Our society was defined by a network of feuds with little cooperation. We scavenged on what we could find before the great human kingdom made us flee. \n\nThe Great Realization changed everything. It came from Brun Agleca which was what used to be called a warlock. Humans had an odd relation with magic. They recognized its use while demonizing those who practiced it. Kings used to keep a council of wizards, but King Alfred III was too nervous that they were a threat to his power. He disbanded the council. \n\nThe wizards were relabeled warlocks and witches, and they continued their work for the next fifty years. Rumors abounded on what they were doing in the human world. Agleca weren't given the chance to develop their own theories. Advisor Granck's voice changed that.\n\nHe and his fellow council members created a spell that broadcasted their message in all our minds. The terrain across the Sagre River was rough, but there were patches that could be reshaped. Humans didn't live there, and we could make it in our image. \n\nOvernight, the Agleca fled there over night. Our numbers were small, and we could only survive a human attack with the help of magic. Luckily, the humans didn't attack. Instead, they rejoiced. They were free of us at last.\n\nThen, they began to notice their real issues. Monster hunters had considerable less work available. Some reintegrated into society. Most couldn't. They began to hunt what little of us remained over there. They turned to accusing neighbors of conspiring with us. The more ambitious worked their way into capturing towns and turning it into their fiefdoms.\n\nThe rain wasn't as plentiful as past years, and the stores were almost empty. King Franklin was a competent ruler, but he could barely keep a lid on the violence. He died twenty years ago. King Victor was the worst king in history.\n\nHe drained the coffers on his own vanity. He tortured any who questioned him. He launched a military campaign against the witch hunters. The defeats bruised his ego causing him to expand his war. It lasted six months, and he lost. He was deposed, and the kingdom collapsed.\n\nI heard the war was still occurring on their side. A few Agleca offered refuge to humans and heard about the travesties that occurred. I hoped they survived and were able to redeem themselves. In spite of all they did in the past, I still wanted the best for them.\n\n---\n\nr/AstroRideWrites",

All around it, screeching noises and banshee howls echoed in the area.\n\nWhere all the humans kept looking at their phones and continued walking without a care.\n\nWas it invisible? How did they not witness its full gory glory and immeasurable incomprehensibility? It waggled a tentacle in front of a human, who simply pushed the offending appendage aside and kept going.\n\nBrimming with annoyance, it slapped the ground with its thrashing tentacles. The humans skittered a bit, before regaining their balance and walking on. Except for one.\n\nFinally, a mortal that acknowledged its presence.\n\n\"Hey, that was rude,\" the human looked mad. Not that insane sort of mad. The angry sort of mad.\n\n\"Behold my true form!\" The entity boldly declared, exhaling a pungent breath that once drove lesser beings to flee in fear. \"Feel your little pea brain crumple into goo and ooze out of your orifices! Experience the melting of your consciousness! The vaporizing of your mentality! The—\"\n\n\"I didn't get any of that,\" the human held out a hand. \"Look, you could just say sorry and we could all be on our way to work.\"\n\nThe eldritch horror laughed, causing vibrations that spread minor tremors in the city area. \"Of couse you don't get it, sad little meat bag. I am incomprehensible. I am impossible for your mind to wrap around. Now concede defeat at what you cannot perceive accurately! Feel—\"\n\n\"I concede defeat. I accept that I don't understand what's your deal,\" the human scoffed. \"So I will leave. Go about my business. And so should you. Maybe someone will understand you one day, but it ain't me.\"\n\nAnd with that, the human walked hurriedly towards a tower of glass, where many other humans entered through the bottom.\n\n**\n--\n\nElvari sighed, handing his handkerchief to the inconsolable creature that had cried a new river in Innsmouth.\n\n\"Nobody goes insane when they see me!\" It sobbed, tentacles lying flat in defeated depression. \"We were incomprehensibly terrifying! We struck fear into the hearts of men! Now, I'm just some sort of distraction they brush aside! Some thing they don't care that they don't understand! What has humanity turned into?\"\n\n\"There, there,\" Elvari patted it on the head. \"Adjusting to modern times is hard. I know. Humans aren't so easily frightened anymore.\"\n\n\"You...you live among humans now,\" it blew a thick wad of snot into Elvari's handkerchief. \"They don't look like they're going mad...and you're the God of Madness...what is this madness? How are you not bothered by that?\"\n\n\"Madness takes many forms. It does not always involve screaming and running. Or humans bleeding out of their orifices and clawing their eyes out. Now, there's a modern kind of madness. Like humans doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results. Or spending over 70% of their time staring into their mobile phones, and then wondering why can't they maintain eye contact or genuine friendship with another human. Or constantly insulting another human and not understanding why that person would hate them.\"\n\n\"Well, shit, now that you say it, those humans on the streets, they had their eyes glued onto those little boxes.\"\n\n\"Mobile phones,\" Elvari corrected his fellow eldritch.\n\n\"Teach me then,\" the entity held an expectant gaze. \"How did you do all that? Make these humans addicted to mobile phones, and being so irrationally hateful to each other at times?\"\n\n\"I didn't do any of that,\" Elvari shrugged. \"Long before I returned to this Earth, humans desensitized themselves. To glance over rather than fear the unknown. To inflict all that madness on themselves, by themselves.\n\n---\n\n[Thanks for reading!

I made a note to myself to get some fresh s’leth’manoth as soon as I figured out what woke me up. I open the ~3/4 of my eyes that aren’t sealed shut from being asleep for so long and I give my wings a flutter.\n\n\nThe first thing I see is see are the walls of the cave I’m in. “Thats right”, I think to myself. I chose this place because no one in their right mind would ever come up here. The second thing I saw was the thing that wasn’t in its right mind. It was an animal. Like a hairless monkey on its hind legs. It was frozen in fear. Trembling. Enraged by its impertinence, I took hold of the pitiful thing with a wing appendage and squeezed. Looking the monkey square in the eye I bellowed my avian cry of rage. \n\n\n“KRAHHHH”\n\n\nI give another screech but my throat is gummed up from being asleep so long. It comes out weird. \n\n\n“IQRAAAAA”\n\n\nThere’s terror in the monkey’s eyes. Suddenly I feel ashamed. Am I really feeling bad for the monkey? I slacken my grip and decide to take pity on the thing. Before releasing it, I decide to give it some advice, which I beam into its head. Generic stuff like be a good person and love your neighbor. The monkey recites what I telepathically communicate to it as I’m doing so. \n\n\nI release it and cloak myself so as not to be detected. \n\n\n\nI expect the thing to immediately flee but instead it simply smiles and calmly leaves the cave. I follow, unseen. The monkey goes back to its monkey friends and shares my advice with them. It’s actually happy. Unworried about the fact that it had narrowly escaped a trip to the shadow realm at the hands of a 7th level avernian l’zoth. \n\n\n*A strange reaction and a strange place, this earth*, I think to myself, a little worried that I’ve lost my edge. *I’ve got to get back to the plane of suffering ASAP.* ",

Yes, you absorbed his alcoholism--but as someone who never drank in the first place, perhaps you can be the infertile soil in which this seed finally dies. \"I'm glad,\" you say. \"Now, what are you going to order?\"\n\nHe studies the menu. \"I don't know,\" he says. \"Everything looks so good.\" He laughs, as if stunned. \"I am actually looking forward to food again! Holy cow. Wow.\"\n\nYou smile. You absorbed his depression, too--but as someone with an extensive support network of friends and family, perhaps you're more equipped to weather the storm. \"I heard the waffle fries are good,\" you say.\n\nHe gasps. \"I can have gluten again!\"\n\nYou absorbed his celiac disease--but as someone who's always been paleo-curious, perhaps you should be cutting out carbs anyway.\n\nHe orders three servings of waffle fries, and you watch in quiet contentment as he begins to snarf.\n\n\"You know,\" he says, his mouth full, \"I just want to thank you again for absorbing my lupus.\"\n\nYou lower your single hard-boiled egg. \"Lupus?\"\n\n\"Yeah, man. It's a real son of a bitch.\"\n\n*\"Lupus?* That wasn't part of our deal. You didn't tell me you had lupus.\"\n\nHe flags down a waiter, orders another plate of fries. \"I thought you knew,\" he says. \"I mean, I never wanted to be one of those *hides-his-lupus* guys.\"\n\n\"Alex, how was I going to know you had lupus? I can't read minds.\"\n\n\"You told me we were doing a *ritual,\"* he says. \"I mean, if you weren't reading my mind, why did you put your palm on my forehead for so long? Why were you sweating like that?\"\n\nHe'd never understand transcerebral friction--the heat of a true mind-meld. At this point, you question his understanding of basic social cues. You watch, incredulous, as he sprays more crumbs on the gingham tablecloth.  \"I'm very lupus-forward!\" he exclaims. \"It's all over my Grindr profile.\" He chuckles, shrugs. \"Guess I should delete that part, now that you've got it. Thanks again.\"\n\nWell, crap.\n\nYou try to remember your aunt who had lupus, the medications she kept in an old cookie jar. She used to sit on a therapeutic donut pillow. Was that because of the lupus?\n\nThe man across from you scratches his forearm. \"Freaking eczema, man,\" he says. \"Hey, think you could help me out real quick?\"\n\nmy substack (featuring more free stories) --> [https://jaywilcoxworx.substack.com/](https://jaywilcoxworx.substack.com/)\n\nmy subreddit --> [https://www.reddit.com/r/JWORX\\_531/](https://www.reddit.com/r/JWORX_531/)\n\n[https://www.jaywilcoxwriter.net/](https://www.jaywilcoxwriter.net/)",

And more pieces than whole, he becomes victim number 52,567 of the world's latest useless conflict.\n\nStill dripping with their buddy, the fire-team moves on and hopefully out of range of any other grenades. And with a few bullets downrange, they are gone. \n\nThe idiot hero, who will probably win a medal, lies scattered about until a medical-responder-droid begins sweeping him up. Once enough of him to complete his build is collected, the wounds are scanned as the responder races to a safe point behind the line. As it moves the responder builds the wounds and their life saving twin. The exact wounds are created to analyze and find a complete fix, which it knits into the soldier's wounds. The action takes place inside a metal cylinder. It is flooded with saline, and all flesh is scrubbed and knitted with the nanoprinted fix, and after the wounds are finished being filled, the body's heart is started again. \n\nIts charge finished and whole, the medical responder receives orders and roars away for another casualty revival. It shits its former patient back into the fray before disappearing back beyond the line. \n\nThe confused soldier sits up and looks around but recovers quickly. This has happened before. But it is never fun. He stands on wobbly legs and begins to walk back to camp, knowing along the way a replacement kit and rifle will find him. And he knows soon enough another infantry platoon will come along and sweep him up because the battle never stops. \n\nAll part of a normal day at the office.",

In fact, it's not only the original work in its most faithful translation, but it's translated from all languages including Quenya, its sub-type Exilic Quenya and colloquial common Tellerin. That too on a world record time of 18.2 seconds. Even impregnation takes longer than that\\*\\*. Tell me, strange questioner, if humans stopped pretending to be animals would they have lived longer?\\*\\*\\*\\* Oh, curse me all you want, mankind-purist-apologists, you can't convince me my neighbor never spent one night as an Asian Black Bear^(6). Just because you have never observed something does not make it unlikely and in effect impossible. These are my propositions against your questions, strange questioner.\n\nPremise 1:  \nWould you not agree that Hitler was pretending to be evil simply to win over the hearts of the vile Germans back then? I will answer for you, the answer is yes.^(7) I have observed so in humane form.\n\nPremise 2:  \nBy humane moral standards, pretending to be someone good is worse than being evil, no? You are a perfect example. Imagine yourself, if you can, if you will, if you must, as you must. Would it not be kinder to (humane) society if you did not pretend to be a sane man?\n\nPremise 3 & Conclusion all in one:  \nSince we are above humans (in all aspects, greater animals. Let not the priest hear my words.), their rule of pretentiousness being bad is the opposite for us. Which is why my premise and conclusion is the same.\n\nTell me, strange questioner, if we did not pretend to be human, where's the humanity in that?^(8) Would you not agree humanity and unity is a well valuable notion of life as it is said by ancient greekian spaniards? Then where is the humanity in abandoning humane aspects of life. And thus I reclude my argument. I still despise you for forcing my mouth to answer me, though they believe you hadn't even touched me once. And thus I bid goodbye, strange questioner... and good riddance.",

Upholder was the leader of the Council of Altruists, Earth's best superhero team.\n\nUpholder replied, in an inquiring tone, \"So, to go over this one last time. You say that some previously unheard-of organisation stopped by in Ann Arbor, and announced that everyone was invited for free, no ticket or payment needed, to a concert that would feature Blackpink, N'SYNC reunited, Sir Elton John, Metallica, Linkin Park, Paul McCartney, a holographic session of Michael Jackson's best songs and dances - and then?\"\n\nThe superintendent nodded to indicate that Upholder had gotten all the details right, and he then continued, \"And then as I said just now - none of the featured artists appeared. Then, some strange sound, sounding like music, speaking, static AND gibberish jumbled together, issued forth from the stadium's sound system. It wasn't loud, or ear-piercing. It was just... normal. Jumbled sound, but generic jumbled sound.\"\n\nUpholder then went on, \"And then everyone went crazy? Just lost their minds?\" The superintendent sighed and gestured at the corridors leading to the wards, where shrieking, thumping, howling, yelling and incoherent babbling resounded, as he stated, \"Yes. Just snapped. As though something in the sound just literally blew their minds!\"\n\nUpholder nodded, a small smile forming on his face, even as the tense superintended gasped, \"What's there to smile about, Upholder?! I've got my institution overloaded with people who've lost their minds, and if they were to turn violent, my security would be overwhelmed fifty to one! I called you here to help me keep them in control, not just stand there and grin!\"\n\nUpholder held up his hands in a peaceable gesture and replied calmingly, \"Relax, Mr. Superintendent. I believe I can fix this problem. Cosmic Particle?\" and the cheery, upbeat voice of the Cosmic Particle, the Council of Altruists' official Third Ally with unlimited teleportation ability, replied, \"Yup, Jake! What can I do for you?\"",

        "body": "Arwa's forearms tensed and she began to sink as her tail went rigid. Mara reached out for one of Arwa's balled up fists and pulled her back up toward the surface of the water as a gentle wave rushed toward the shore. Up above they could see the warbling, dancing image of the angry sailor as he waved his fishing pole about and glared down at them.\n\n\"He's not all that different from us in that sense,\" Mara said, shrugging.\n\n\"It's vicious and cruel,\" Arwa said, yanking her fist free. \"If he wants fish, I'll give him fish.\" The words seeped out in a low growl through gritted teeth.\n\nMara leveled with her sister and looked into her eyes. \"I know how you feel about hooks, but aren't we all just trying to hook something, in a sense?\"\n\nArwa stared blankly into the distance. A small school of guppies swirled around the pilings that held the fisherman's pier aloft then darted between the sisters leaving a small trail of bubbles.\n\nMara sighed and stared up at the sailor. \"We finally got him to notice us and all you can focus on is his hook? Can't we have just a little fun with him?\"\n\nHer sister's shoulders slouched a little. Arwa's dark hair caught a few stray shafts of sunlight stabbing down through the slats of the pier overhead. The muscles in her arms softened. She looked her sister in the eye and for a moment her own eyes sparkled.\n\nThey both smiled together. \"He wants fish?\" Arwa repeated deviously. \"Let's give him some fish.\"\n\nThe call radiated out silently from their flukes as they began swimming around each other in tight, orbital rings. Fish from all around the peer came to investigate, their huge round eyes locked onto the two sisters as they joined in the scaly vortex.\n\nMara could still hear the sailor stamping his feet overhead, shaking his fist at them as he leaned over the edge of the wooden platform and peered into the dark ocean waters. She looked around her at the growing taurus of fish and her heart blossomed and radiated joy. She loved this dance, this communion with ocean life. Tuna and guppies together, all of them swirling about to the tune of their ocean sisters' melodic call.\n\nAfter a few moments the rotating mass of muscle and scales had become a graceful flurry of thousands of fish and hundreds of species. A couple of squid darted about in the mix along with a lone octopus and a few curious dolphins. These in particular smiled at the mermaid sisters with their bright, intelligent eyes. They knew when mischief was afoot and they wouldn't miss it for the world.\n\nMara locked eyes with her sister at the far end of the toroidal vortex. Arwa nodded and smiled. Together they spiraled out and guided the mass into a single long snaking entity that swept under the pier casting an ominous shadow on the sandy sea floor below. They arced wide and dove deep before guiding the collective beast skyward. The dolphins rushed excitedly to the head of the pack and whistled loudly as they all broke through into the cool morning air, launching straight at the bewildered sailor.\n\nThe poor man stood stunned, locked in place as the mermaids and dolphins soared straight for him. He ducked in a panic, throwing his arms over his head for protection. A dolphin's flipper caught him on the arm and threw him off balance. Arwa flicked her tail at him as she sailed by, knocking him back onto his feet as a writhing, flickering hoard of fish began slapping and thumping against him. He stumbled and slipped, frantically fighting to remain upright in the onslaught. The sound was deafening. It was a thunderous spray of seafoam and muscle. For every fish the sailor deflected three more smacked him in the face, the crotch, and the gut. He staggered back across the pier, dropping his fishing pole. His hat flew away, possibly caught deliberately in a dolphin's teeth.\n\nMara and Arwa splashed back into the water and guided the group in another wide arc around the tip of the pier and back down for another leap, but before they broke the surface again they saw the sailor plunge into the ocean, his arms reaching desperately for the surface. The squirming, twisting schools of fish around him continued knocking against his chest, pounding him deeper and deeper with each successive impact. A large marlin near the back of the parade nearly skewered the poor sailor, but instead it just flicked him hard with its powerful tail before scurrying off.\n\nThe girls ceased their fish call song and the various schools of fish quickly coalesced into their respective groups and dissipated back into the sea. Mara watched the man as he continued to drift down toward a cluster of coral. Her heart pounded. She'd never been this close to a man in the water before. She glanced at Arwa whose gaze was also fixed on the man.\n\nAfter a long moment of silence the man hadn't moved. He floated down until he was resting against the sharp coral. \"Do you think he's dead?\" Mara whispered.\n\nArwa looked at her and half shrugged. \"Not yet,\" she said firmly, and kicked her tail to head over to him.\n\n\"Wait,\" Mara called, dashing after her. \"We've done enough, we don't have to...\" She held her breath.\n\nThey looked down at him together. His eyes were closed, his face relaxed. Tiny clouds of red floated away from the back of his head and thin slits in his cheek. He looked soft and delicate, a far cry from the seething, loud monster he'd been moments earlier.\n\nMara reached out to touch his face, but Arwa's hand quickly grabbed her by the wrist.\n\n\"No,\" Arwa said softly. \"We'll just leave him.\"\n\nMara glared at her sister. \"We can't. He'll die.\"\n\n\"Good.\"\n\nMara shook her head slowly. Her golden hair swirled off her shoulders and floated against her cheeks. \"It's not right,\" she said. \"We're not sirens. We lured him into the sea, we had our fun, now we need to set things right.\"\n\nArwa's grip on her wrist loosened. She took a deep breath, her chest heaving gently in the shimmering shallows. \"Fine,\" she said, releasing Mara's wrist. \"Let's get him to shore, but I'm taking his fishing rod.\"\n\nMara smiled. \"Alright.\"\n\nTogether they hoisted him off the sand, each holding an arm, and they dragged him to the surface. They rode a shallow wave onto a nearby beach and squirmed their way out of the reach of the water. After a moment his subconscious seemed to realize he was safe and he coughed and sputtered, belching up a gush of seawater. As his eyes blinked open the sisters flung themselves back into the surf and rushed to the pier. Mara helped propel her sister up onto the wooden planks so she could grab the fishing rod, then they disappeared into the depths laughing and chattering all the way home.",

I finally could return home.  \nI became somewhat renowned as a battle mage, but frankly, almost all of us who survived that Hell, gained a moniker or two.  \nNonetheless, I tried to ignore it, desiring to return to peace, to a quiet life in my hometown, a small mountain village.  \nI didn't get the quiet life I wanted though.  \nWhen I got home, besides the fact that I needed a lot of cleaning to do around my house, and garden, the villagers were amazed by me.  \nThey really remembered me, \"little John\", they called me, despite being twice as tall as any of them.  \nI can't even remember when I felt actually my age, oh Gods Above...I am just 26.  \nMy life can really start.\n\n\n\nChildren begged for stories, and I did tell them about the war in much cuter details, and performed simple magic to entertain them.  \nThe women of the village tried to set me up with their daughters, or with single women, and oddly enough I wasn't completely against the idea, though I asked for some time.  \nI still had nights where I froze my room by reflex when I woke up from a nightmare.  \nPests needed eradicated from the fields, which I did with fine-controlled water magic.  \nAnd the village for some reason had monsters intruding on its lands on a daily basis.  \nIt was chaotic. Never a moment of true rest, and yet, somehow...  \nThis is what is healing me.\n\n  \nThe laughter of the children, and their wows, and silly but cute questions warm my heart.  \nThey make me remember that there is simplicity, honesty, and a future in this life.  \nThe village women's tries to set me up, annoys me, but also warms me.  \nThey are really thinking about how to bring here some lesser noble woman to be my wife, considering they just found out I got a Mage title from the kingdom itself.  \nThe men see me as one of them, randomly coming over day or night, bringing food, gossip, and booze.  \nI...  \nI can't believe how good this is.  \nI almost feel like being able to actually relax.  \n\n\nI kill the Horned Dragonic Bear, and levitate it back to the village.  \nThe farmers greet me, and the butcher's apprentice rushes to me, takes a look at the bear, smiles, and runs away to announce the butcher that a huge beast needs to be butchered.  \nLife is good.  \nAs I pass by many of my fellow villagers, they all greet me, and after I leave the butcher's shop, I see the women gathered around a carriage.  \nIt wore a noble's sigil that I recognized.  \nA young woman stepped out, and walked out, under the gaze, and \"knowing\" looks of the women.  \n\"Captain! I finally found you! I was waiting you in the Capital.\" she said, smiling at me.  \nOh boy.  \nLife just became wilder, as this young woman, is the Mountain King's, the king's older brother's only daughter...and she has a huge crush on me, after she joined my squad for a single mission.  \nThis...this will be interesting to navigate through.",

It was one of the ways to repay their kindness of taking me back in and treating me so kindly after I had left long ago to fight in a war for over two decades.\n\nAs soon as the war ended I returned yearning nothing more than a peaceful life in the calm countryside village where I was born and raised. The war changed many things about me, I got stronger physically and mentally, wiser in general and magical knowledge, and more confident in my own ability no longer a spineless coward, but I also got more hollow and emotionless scarred by the things I had seen and experienced. It felt strange to be in a lively and peaceful place like this after what I had lived through, I felt like I was dissociating as I watched the children frolic through the town or watch the people go their way with smiles on their faces.\n\nBut in a way I am glad that they can smile which might be why I am offering my skills to help protect the village to an excessive degree so they can keep being happy. Every morning I scout the surrounding area for danger and checking up on wards I had made to keep out people with vile intentions or violent beasts. But there are many times where they set up nearby and either hurt people or block paths outward or inward, which is when I have to act personally. Luckily no bandit or wolf is a match for some of the opponents I had seen or faced back then are are easily dispatched with a low tier spell.\n\nOnce I am done I walk through the village and talk with the people, trying to find any task I could help out with or more recently having some small talk with them regarding things of little importance though I greatly prefer the former, perhaps because it is a kind of replacement for my duties that filled every moment of my busy days in the past. Luckily there is always one person who needs something from me due to my unique abilities, and I am always glad to offer my magical talents to them, and trying to find a solution often requires a lot of challenging experimentation to adapt spells of warfare for something mundane. Fireball sigils that ignite with a permanent timer that cause them to activate and deactivate when day fades to provide light, or a modified earthquake spell that tills the earth of field in one go, it always is a fun activity to figure out some new usage of a spell that I once used to kill.\n\nAnd while I don't look back to those two decades on the frontlines as a positive time the children keep asking for stories of those days. Their curiosity and wonder of it is strange to me though I suppose I once was just like them at one point, thus I often relent and tell them of some of the events though I never glamorize the life of a soldier on the frontlines the horrors of war are just that, horrors and they need to be feared and told to avoid further conflicts. But despite it all they seem to adore each tale and seem to look up to me, a few even asking me to train them or talking about how they would study to become like me. One day they might realize their fantasies for what they are when they grow up but until that happens I entertain their requests for stories.\n\nIt is a simple daily routine which compared to those days is far more reliable and less chaotic without the constant battles and unpredictability brought by war. And despite it there is still some traces of chaos brought by this daily life, crazy ideas turned requests made by the villagers, rambunctious children constantly getting into dangerous situations in attempts to become more like me, and near weekly attacks of monsters and bandit clans. It's a life I prefer and honestly enjoy more with each day passed.",

        "body": "*Gailen looked upon hell and wept.*\n\n*A sea of flames was all that remained of the once great city of Itheros. Thousands of homes, only hours ago all painted in bright, vivid colors, lay in smouldering ruins. Massive chunks of stone blasted from the now crumbling city wall scattered the battlefield, crushing beneath them countless men and buildings alike. And the people… Gailen closed his eyes. Emperor’s ashes, the people.* \n\n*He could feel their souls drifting across the battlefield, mind-numbing in their magnitude. Thousands and thousands and thousands of innocent lives taken within minutes. He hadn’t been able to save them. He hadn’t made it in time. Hadn’t been prepared for Wythal to be this ruthless.*\n\n*And they knew he had failed them.*\n\n*He felt their anguished gazes on him. He opened his mouth to say something. Anything. The dead couldn’t hear him now but he needed to explain. That he had tried. That -* \n\n*“It’s not over.”*\n\n*Gailen stiffened. Charred grass crunched beneath thumping footsteps and he turned to see Blaith join him on the hilltop overlooking the corpse of the city. The warrior’s armor had been all but obliterated, hanging on to her massive frame by threads. As the women turned to survey the city, Gailen saw that most of her once ethereal face had been burned away. Alas.*\n\n*“Everything’s gone,” Gailen said, his voice hoarse. “What more could come?”*\n\n*Blaith took a deep, rattling breath. She raised Akynthosia, her thrice-blessed sword, and pointed into the distance. As she did, the ground beneath them shook.*\n\nBang.\n\n*Gailen dragged his gaze to the horizon, unwilling to accept what he saw taking shape in the swirling ash and dust. “It cannot be,” he whispered. Had they not lost enough? Had this day not already extracted a heavy enough toll?*\n\nBang.\n\n*The ground shook underfoot once more. In the distance, a gargantuan figure emerged. Humanoid, with shoulders brushing the clouds. Three heads where men would only have one. And a singular eye in the center face, visible even from this distance as a fiery glowing circle. It took another step towards the city.*\n\nBang.\n\n*A hand fell on Gailen’s shoulder and he looked up to see Blaith staring down the oncoming monstrosity. “I must rely on you once more, my friend.”*\n\n*And though Gailen did not believe he was capable of harboring more grief, whatever was left of his numb heart broke as Blaith turned to him and smiled. Burnt skin flaking away into the wind, blood crusting every inch of her face…the Knight of Akynthos had never looked more beautiful to him. And more resigned.*\n\n*Gailen wiped his tears away and straightened. Death had finally come, and he would not greet the hoary bastard empty handed.* \n\nBang.\n\n*Fingers tingling as he opened himself to the channels of power, Gailen raised his arms to the sky. Beside him, Blaith readied her sword.*\n\nBang.\n\n*“For Crown and for kin…” she whispered.* \n\n*“For love and for life,” Gailen finished. Above them, the sky darkened as the shadow of the demon sentinel fell upon them. An all encompassing -*\n\nBang. \n\nBang. Bang. Bang. Bang. Bang.\n\nGailen’s eyes shot open and he rocked awake, his breath coming in short gasps. Heart hammering, his eyes darted around his surroundings. A small room, sunlight filtering through a slit high above, illuminating dancing motes of dust. A tiny desk in one corner, and a curtain-draped entrance from beyond which came the hammering sound of someone at the door.\n\nGailen exhaled, hands cupping his face. It had been a nightmare. \n\nHe was home. \n\nHe was alive.\n\nTaking a deep breath, he brushed the dampness from his eyes and threw off his covers. A bitter chill washed over him and he glanced briefly at the empty hearth he hadn’t bothered to light the night before. \n\nThe pounding on his door continued, now accompanied by muted voices that occasionally spiked with excitement. He wearily climbed out of bed, groaning as he settled his weight onto his feet. At only thirty summers old, he wasn’t an old man by any means, but by the Emperor he sure felt like one at times. \n\n“I’m coming you bastards,” he muttered, “give me a minute.”\n\nA stained brown robe lay on the floor that he picked up and cast an appraising eye over. Clean enough, at least by his village’s standards. He threw it on and shoved through the curtain into his meager living area that doubled as his kitchen. With a wave of his hand, his door swung open and a young boy stumbled in, clearly caught in the middle of trying to bang on his door again.\n\n“What is it this time,” Gailen grumbled. “More goblins? Another robbery? Another fool sticking his hand in a horse's mouth?”\n\nThe boy looked up from the floor, eyes wide. “Reya’s baby!” he squeaked out. “Her baby’s not coming!”\n\nGailen froze. Outside, several other children were clustered around the door, likely having been sent by different adults to fetch him. They all stared at him, eyes wide with wonder and awe. Stupid brats.\n\n“Take me to her,” he ordered, cinching his robe tight. “Hurry!”\n\nThe boy scrambled to his feet and hastily bowed before scampering out. Gailen rolled his eyes; he’d told them they didn’t need to bow but functioning ears seemed to be in short supply in this village.\n\nHe followed them outside and slammed his door shut with another wave of his hand. The kids jumped at the noise and glanced back excitedly before he motioned for them to keep moving.\n\n“How long ago did she enter labor,” he barked, catching up to the boy in the lead. When the child seemed confused, Gailen snorted. “How long has it been since you were sent to fetch me?”\n\n“Less than half a bell, m’lord”\n\n“I told you not to call me that.”\n\n“Yes, m’lord.”\n\n“You just did it again!”\n\n“Sorry, m’lord.”\n\nGailen sighed. He fell back a pace behind the boy and let his eyes wander over the village that he had spent his childhood in, what seemed like a lifetime ago. He had left at the age of fifteen with a dream to enroll in the Imperial Academy and serve the Emperor as a mage. In the years that he had been away, this tiny hamlet had grown beyond recognition.\n\nMuddy tracks had become cobbled - albeit still narrow - streets. Thatch roofs had given way to tiles. And the noise! The ring of blacksmith hammers, rattling of wagons, bellowing of oxen, and the chattering of the hundreds of now unfamiliar residents filled the once quiet streets of his youth with a wholly unrecognizable melody. \n\nThat noise ceased as he passed, residents stopping in their tracks to watch him go by. Whispers erupted in his wake, accompanied by the occasional cheer that was quickly stifled. The village didn’t yet know what to make of their supposed prodigal son’s return. Valewind was tucked away far from the Empire’s center, and news of the larger world rarely made its way back here. The Great Wars, the Battle of Itheros, the Night of Sorrows…these were all faint rumors out here. No one knew of Gailen Lightblessed. Here, he was simply Gailen. A middling mage with a few neat tricks. It was why he had returned.\n\nThough life here had been anything but peaceful.\n\nThe boy finally came to a halt in front of one of the older houses in the village. Its door was simply a beaded curtain and the roof was still made of straw. Men and women crowded near the entrance, from beyond which Gailen could hear pained moans and soft voices. \n\n“Here!” the young boy said brightly. Several heads lifted in his direction, and he saw more than one relieved expression. A woman poked her head into the room and immediately an old woman came bustling out.\n\n“About time,” she snapped. She wagged a finger at the boy. “You better not have dawdled getting him.” \n\n“I didn’t, Mrs. Arling,” the boy said, wilting under her gaze. “I promise!”\n\nThe woman swung to face Gailen. Though she barely came up to his chest, she struck an imposing figure with her straight-backed posture and mane of steel-gray hair. “Arthen told me you helped his boy mend a broken hand.”\n\nGailen nodded. \n\nShe tilted her head in acknowledgement as if he’d passed some test. “Good, come with me, mage.” She whirled around and marched back inside.",

        "body": "It’s an endless slog, really.\n\nOne thing after another, one spell after another.\n\nBlast apart this weapon, turn that field into mud, blind them in the darkness, heal these allies, mind this hostage. Over and over and over. And then it was over. A long march back to the capital, a long speech about a war the speaker saw no part of, an even longer ceremony that ended in what must have been cheering but only registered as screams.\n\nHands, grabbing and touching, grasping and shaking, tapping that feels like striking. *Smile*, they say, and press something metal into my hand. Is it a dagger? Who must I kill today? Or maybe it’s some rock they want me to enchant so they can track the enemy back to their camp.\n\nBut no, they usher me away and down the stairs with the screaming screaming screaming in the background. And in my hands is a shape. A metal pin with a ribbon. There aren’t any words on it, but it says “Congratulations on surviving. You did well, killing all the people we told you to kill. Be honored. Be grateful. Now go away quietly.” An order then. Go away into the night, disappear and never ask for more than has been given. I can do that. I’m good at following orders.\n\nIt’s another long walk to the edge of the empire. To some minor annexed territory where no one of influence resides. Even the lord of this territory is someone small and without accolades. With land, but less power than even the unlanded nobility. He tills the fields with his people, though it is rough and unforgiving work. He puts the livestock out to pasture, and I too, another workhorse on the land.\n\nI am welcomed. But of course, I always followed my orders well. Who would refuse such a good worker? Such a good soldier? He smiles so I know he will have use for me. *What are your orders, sir?*\n\n*Orders? You don’t gotta be so formal as all that round here. Specially not to me, Dame Mage. But if you’re offering, it sure would be nice if you could do something about the wild boars. They’ve been digging up the fields and trampling the crops.*\n\n*Right away, sir.*\n\nI can do that. Killing a few boars is easy. They have no swords and I do not understand the words they scream at me. They have no counter spells. They die quickly by my power, nothing more than giant piles of meat.\n\nI bring them back to prove they are dead, and the people scream again. They gather and scream and *touch* me. But they also smile to let me know that I have served my purpose well. They smile to let me know they have more use for me. They feed me to let me know that I will be expected to do something again soon and I must be well enough to do it.\n\nIt’s warm in my stomach. Strange. It’s hardly the finest meal I’ve eaten. There’s nothing exotic or special about roasted meat. But it’s the first time it’s tasted like anything I can remember in a long long time.\n\nThere are more orders the next day. More people with tasks for me. The lord seems to approve their requests so I go. *Could you water this field?* Such a gentle order. *It’d be awful nice if you’d help me clear away these fallen trees.* A strange and roundabout manner. *Miss Mage, help, my ball is stuck on the roof!* A little more demanding, but still without bite.\n\nThe way they give orders here is weird. As if they expect me to refuse. As if I could refuse. So strange. So unfamiliar.\n\nEach task done is accompanied by a smile. It tells me I have been useful. I have done well. As expected. But then they say *Thank you*. Over and over, without fail. Thank you thank you thank you.\n\nThey greet me when I pass by for rounds, as my fellow soldiers never did.\n\nThey invite me to eat with them, but then have no task for me. *No, no, sit, you are a guest, I will take care of that.* I don’t understand. Giving such good food is always accompanied by a big request, but they never ask for anything. Except the children sometimes ask for reports.\n\n*Tell us a story! About the war!* They crowd around. Always the children, and seldom the adults. Odd, to leave report gathering in the hands of the children, but they are too small to do much else I suppose. I tell them the battle logistics of the last battle I was in.\n\n*Not that! Tell us something interesting!*\n\n*Interesting?* That has never been a necessary component before. I catch myself frowning. Bad. Do not show displeasure when given orders. Perhaps they want to hear about the things I usually leave out of reports? My previous commanding officer said they were unnecessary details, but nothing about this assignment has been ordinary.\n\nInstead, I tell them about a horse the opposing army had. It was as large as two grown men and covered in red leather plate armor. Its dark eyes were fearless in the face of even my largest fire spells and it did not cower from the sounds of the explosions. It marched forward through mud and blaze alike, and carried its metal clad knight tirelessly. When the knight fell, it pushed forward alone, and knocked several of our men from their own saddles.\n\nThey liked that report much better.\n\n*What happened to the horse?* They would ask.\n\n*I don’t know. I was moved to a different battlefront after that.*\n\n*Then what do you think happened?*\n\n*You wish for me to speculate?* In a report?\n\n*No, we wanna know what you think happened to the horsey!* Added a little girl.\n\n*Yeah! Like if it got a reward! Or went back to its horse family!*\n\nI couldn’t say what happened to the horse. It probably continued to fight in battles until it died or was so injured that they killed it themselves, but somehow I didn’t think the children would like that. Instead, I tell them what I wish had happened. An unusual inclusion for a report. My opinion is seldom desired, and never about these sorts of matters.\n\n*They gave the horse the juiciest and most delicious apples they could find. So red and shiny that they glowed in the night. And then when the battle was over they sent the horse home. It returned to its wild herd and now runs freely across the Great Plains.* I tried.\n\nI look to my new liege lord, he smiles in approval. I made the right choice after all.\n\nThe children are delighted by this made up account. I don’t understand, but it’s warm again. Warmth without eating. Without fire. So strange. So very strange.\n\nI do not understand this assignment, but I think, as I have never been allowed to before, that I like it.\n\nThis time, I am the one smiling.",

This does not bother her.\n\nShe is a veteran of the ‘Long War,’ a part of it as much as it is her. The grievances of this conflict come in many forms. An awkward gait, a stump where an arm once was or a flickering eye colour are giveaways to the else informed. One versed in the mystical may even take note of her soul. Stretched and out back together too many times. A nasty bruise on one’s psyche. \n\nWhat she needs is time, and warm food, and quiet nights. Days that are marked only by their ending. Devoid of screaming and all it entails.\n\nShe fingers at the spine of her tome, attached at her belt. Archaie, her name and the name of her master, as well as all those that preceded him. It is tradition, to carry on a lineage. One that twists and turns into the intricacies of time. But it is a weary burden and she is so very tired.\n\nThis is what propels her to this small village at the end of the world. Other surviving mages have left for the bustle of the cities, or the rallying cry of other nations. She does not know why. Perhaps fame and glory? She has had her fill of both.\n\nThere was a time she remembers, many, **many** cycles ago. Before she viewed the world through painful mana-laden eyes that this would have excited her. An escape from the dreary monotony of life that had clamped around her. Now? That is all she covets.\n\nThe woods begin to taper off. The thicket clearing, ground becoming more even, the eyes less numerous. The far off landscape reveals the soft, warm torchlight of the village.\n\nShe takes a short breath.

I carried a scar across my cheek shaped like a star, the kind no glamour would hide. My staff was blackened, my familiar - a red-winged owl named Quill - refused to speak for weeks.\n\nBut the trees still grew as they always had, honey-thick with moss. The village roofs wore wildflowers in their thatch, as though time had not passed. And when I stepped over the old threshold of my cottage, a child was already waiting on the porch.\n\n“Are you really the Battlemage?” she asked, not afraid of the fire-stained cloak, nor the quiet thrum of power still clinging to me like smoke.\n\nI blinked, weary. “Not anymore.”\n\nShe grinned. “Good. Then you can tell us stories.”\n\n\n\nThey came in waves. Children, mostly, with scraped knees and twig crowns. “Tell us about the time you slew the Mirror Hydra!” “Did you really make a volcano cry?” “Is it true you turned a general to stone with just a look?”\n\nAt first, I demurred. Said nothing. Nodded silently, letting the wind answer for me.\n\nBut they kept coming.\n\nSo I began to tell the stories. Not the real ones - too dark, too heavy - but softer versions. Stories with clever tricks and poetic justice, where no one died screaming and the hero always came home.\n\nI didn’t notice the pain dulling until the nightmares stopped waking me.\n\n\n\nOld Marell brought me a basket of blackberries one morning. “Could you enchant the field? The crows are cleverer than they used to be.”\n\nI tried to say no. Tried to explain I was retired, exiled from war by choice.\n\nBut Marell had once shared her bread with me, in the year my parents died of winter fever.\n\nSo I warded her fields with a ring of singing stones. The crows didn’t come back - but a pair of curious ravens nested in her chimney, and began mimicking her complaints.\n\nThe villagers called them “Marell’s Echoes.”\n\n\n\nPeace never means silence.\n\nThere were lanterns that flickered blue without cause. Wells that whispered back in foreign tongues. Children were born with stars on their palms, and twice a month, something clawed at the northern hills.\n\nThey always asked me to fix it.\n\nI always said I’d try.\n\nI did not keep a ledger. Did not ask coin. I unspooled a bit of the war magic, repurposed and reshaped it. Spun terror into tenderness. Where once I had scorched fortresses, now I mended fences and quieted restless shadows with lullabies.\n\nIt was not glorious.\n\nBut it was honest.",

It burned now, singeing the hairs around it as though it really were a lightning bolt slashing down his face. His curse from the war greeted him every morning until he muttered a little charm to keep the spreading at bay and the burning tamed.\n\nHis little cottage was hazy with smoke from the flickering orange embers in the hearth nearby. The village around him was waking. The dogs were barking at the clucking chickens and quiet laughter began to chitter from the waking children. \n\nThe people of Sunnrak never knew his name before he left a dozen summers before. He was just another bastard from the tavern whore. What they never knew, but certainly suspected now, was that he was the bastard of a wizard. Alcor's name came back to his village the day he killed his own father in combat. The truth became known when the great Zephryn fell and his son received his power, as all wizards do when the ones that sired them fall. Alcor's power grew, but the battle still left him in search of a cure for his curse.\n\nThe grizzled war hero hadn't even made it to his feet yet before a child was rapping his tiny knuckles against his shabby door. \n\n\"Enter,\" he said.\n\nThe child stumbled through clumsily and with eyes wide as he starred at the blaring scar. He looked hastily at the floor and jumped into his prepped words.\n\n\"Master Alcor, Holly missing sir, saw wolf tracks nearby where she went missing, also can you show us the trick you did last week along the way there, Billy wasn't there to see it yesterday because he was sick, but you made him better so now he wants to see it an-\"\n\n\"I'll be right there, boy,\" the wizard said, \"I'm on my way.\"\n\nThe child nodded, turned heel and swept himself out of the room with a rush of air. Alcor sighed with a tiny bit of relief. The scar used to stretch down the length of his neck, across his collar bone and chest. These days it had receded up to his chin and jawline. He would serve his people. He would continue to heal. He breathed a little easier everyday he tended to them.",

My enemy, purged from the land.\n\nI rise from my slumber, and stretch mightily. The time has come to defend my home once again. I've been waging this war for as long as I can remember. As The Immortal One opens the door, I tear into the grass and chase the geese. Their retreat is disorganized. They fear my power, but sadly their wings carry them faster than my legs. I bellow at them, knowing that the great task is not yet done.\n\nThe yard is but the beginning. I follow my nose, charging towards the enemy's usual haunts. The pond is purged, followed by the garden. As always, they elude me, but I know I have put fear in their hearts.\n\nI move to repel them from beneath The Great Chestnut Tree, but there is something different. There is one that does not flee before me. My eyes widen in fear as it hisses, moving towards me. It does not flee, what power must it be holding? As I twist to begin my own expeditious retreat, I almost collide with the ground. I run, I run as fast as I can to safety, knowing the monster is but a tail's length behind me.\n\nMy legs do not fail. Soon, I sit outside the door. I entreat The Immortal One to open it, for time is of the essence. I know not where my pursuer has gone, only that the monster will catch me if The Immortal one does not make haste. They oblige, looking down upon me with light in their eyes. I charge inside, then take refuge behind the chair. The fear begins to bleed away. I allowed myself to be routed, but better to be routed than destroyed utterly. I have lost a battle, but the war will still rage on. I pray I do not cross paths again with the same foe.",

        "body": "\"It just doesn't make sense,\" I say, pushing Livia, our healer, out of the way of the incoming axe. The minotaur's heavy swing twists ever so slightly, and the guaranteed death-blow ends up sliding right off my cheap armor, crunching into the stone floor of the dungeon.\n\nLivia gasps, rushing over to heal the mortal blow, and her brows furrow in frustration when she discovers I'm just bruised. It hurts, sure, but I'd live even without healing. I'd live no matter what, apparently.\n\n\"Hold up,\" I say, in the next hallway, stepped forward and activating a trap tile. It sends countless, ancient, poison-tipped arrows hurtling across the gap, except for the four arrows which should have hit me; those traps misfired. Morrison, our rogue, looks at them with increasing consternation.\n\n\"You see, the thing about prophecy is that once it's known, it fundamentally can't be true any longer,\" I say, continuing my train of thought from earlier. \"If I prophecised that you're going to burn yourself cooking dinner tonight, you could just... not cook dinner. Cold rations are fine, right? But then, the prophecy is false, so it wouldn't have been made.\"\n\n\"No, I get it,\" Gregor, the hero, says with exasperation. \"But some things *must* be unavoidable.\"\n\n\"This isn't!\" I shout, also frustrated. I step in front of the path of the skeleton knight which is running towards Gregor, its sword raised to skewer our party leader, to take the blow for him. The skeleton knight trips, fumbles the sword, which gets caught on the ground so that it's standing upright as the undead creature falls on its own weapon.\n\nThe whole party looks down at the self-skewered skull, its undead light fading from its eye sockets.\n\n\"It would have tripped anyway,\" Gregor mutters, but I don't think he really believes it either.\n\nI sigh, looking at the great heroes fated to save our world—Gregor, Morrison, and Livia, my dear friends—and fated to die in the process, leaving me, their luggage handler, the sole survivor. Prophecy is absolute, according to everyone. If true, that means that no matter what I do, until my friends save the world and die, I am supernaturally unkillable.\n\nThe dungeon boss desperately swings its weapon at me with increasing vigor and futility. Every step I make spares me a fatal wound. It tires from countless strikes to nothing but air, dropping to its knees, and I step forward and lazily stab it in the eye. It falls over, dead. I turn back to my party. \"Do you guys need to rest?\"\n\nGregor looks at his sword, still in its sheath. He hadn't drawn it once the whole dungeon. \"No,\" he mumbles.\n\nProphecy is stupid. It doesn't make sense. But I will happily game the *fuck* out of it.\n\n\"Great. I'll get the loot and we can get out of here,\" I say, stretching my back. \"We can hit the demon lord's castle by end of day.\"",

Things lived within, creatures born from its body but separate. It had no soul of which to speak of, but it had an undeniable presence.\n\nThe dungeon was old. Though time meant little to it, for it had no need to contemplate such things. Boredom was an alien idea, as impossible for it to experience as flight. It simply grew over time, expanding its range more. Gathering more to live within. And encouraging them to fight.\n\nThat is what it craved. The dungeon hungered. It hungered for death to feed its growth. It hungered for the slain to be devoured and borne into new things inside. It hungered for new creatures to come, and fall to its ever gluttonous appetite.\n\nSo the dungeon was canny. It always had been, to attract new creatures. It couldn't communicate, but it could hint. It had its denizens leave on occasion. Those of relative strength, easily swayed by thoughts of getting fame outside. Ones carrying a handful of its grown treasures, to entice.\n\nThe ones that left were so often consumed by bloodshed, they were needed to be put down. It didn't know about the world outside, nor did it care. But it knew of how they would come, seeking more of its treasures.\n\nAnd time and time again, they did. They would ride through, killing without hesitation. Some would die, others descending far enough to snatch some of its treasures. But it was never the best ones. For this dungeon was old. It had many more further down, in places no outsider had yet reached.\n\nBut each time they slowed, the stream coming to an end. The dungeon's hunger grew ever deeper, more malignant when they ended. It needed more. It craved more. It would sent out more of its denizens, in the hopes of attracting more bounties of death.\n\nIt was an ever growing cycle. Outsiders desired more from its core, grown from their struggles and deaths. The dungeons hungered for their deaths in turn. Neither understood the other, unaware of how they lived.\n\nAnd so the dungeon exists. So the dungeon grows. And so, the dungeon *hungers*.",

It was his friend, Hober. \"You... you're dead.\"\n\n\"Death, actually.\" Hober replied, seemingly brushing off the revelation. \"I've long awaited this day, Vyncent of House Ammam.\" Death had a strange visage about him, shimmering, almost as if it were surrounded by a bubble of spilled oil atop a puddle. \n\n\"I-\" Vyn was speechless, his mouth sat agape as Hober began walking more into the tunnel, painted with what looked to be a neon white paint. \n\n\"Coming, Vyncent of House Ammam? Surely you want to follow me and not him.\" Death nodded behind Vyn, prompting him to look over his shoulder at the figure of fire that stood guarding a tunnel with pitch-black smoke billowing out of the entrance. \n\nVyn nodded swiftly, following after Hober. \n\n\"Your manner of death was surprising.\" Death said flatly, \"Flattened by a falling boulder, leading a group of soldiers in a zealous war... I don't think Consciousness would appreciate that; a war in His name.\" Death walked with purpose, the butt of his scythe rapping rhythmically against the floor. While Vyn could not actually see what the floor was made of, the rhythmic rapping of the scythe sounded as if it clacked against metal. \n\n\"Orders, I was just following my brother's orders.\" Vyn looked back at the fiery creature, its flames now dim in the distance. \"Hober, you're death?\" \n\nDeath stopped in its tracks, turning to look at Vyn. \"I am who you want me to be, Vyncent of House Ammam. Hober was escorted, same manner as you, twelve years ago almost to the day.\" Vyn had never forgotten his friend, who drowned in the river Yule all those years ago. \"I take the faces of those who are dear to the recently deceased, it's a kind comfort, it makes the transition to the Afterrealm easier for most.\" Death turned to continue, but felt a hand on his sleeved ulna. \n\n\"Can you change your shape, now? If I were to ask you, could you?\" Vyn asked, hopefulness welling behind tears. \n\n\"I cannot. My form is controlled by your consciousness as you pass.\" Death replied, much to Vyn's disappointment. \"But, not to worry, Vyncent of House Ammam...\" Death offered him a warm nod. \"You shall see your father soon.\" He turned and held out a skeletal hand, pointed towards the gates just beyond them. \"We have arrived. Go, Vyncent of House Ammam. Eternal greatness shall await you, once you have your business with Consciousness, of course.\" \n\n\"Business wi-\" Vyn began to question Death as it disappeared in a cloud of ethereal black smoke. \n\nBefore him, the gates of the Afterrealm, surrounded by clouds, opened.",

        "body": "I knew I was dead. I felt the knife go into my back, felt the soft push as it cut into my heart. No sound, no warning. It was as perfect a slaying as any I had ever done. \n\nKnifed in an alley. An ingnomious and ironic end for the Guilds best. \n\nI had never bothered to wonder what happened after death or where that light went when it left the eyes. See it enough times, and it the very fact of mortality becomes banal. But standing here now at the head of my own corpse, I felt curiosity begin to stir. Everything looked and felt like I was experiencing the world through a very fine silk lace. \n\nI heard a noise behind me as my killer slipped away. I didn’t bother turning around to see who had been bold enough to take the contract. My last professional courtesy. \n\nAt a loss, I stood by my body and waited for… something. For whatever devilish force that punished the bad people. After some time passed and nothing happened, I finally walked toward the entrance to the alley. The street beyond was busy, yet I couldn’t hear much of anything. All other sounds were dim, so the crisp crunch of teeth tearing into an apple immediately caught my attention. \n\nJust to the side of the alley, bright against the dim world, lounged a person. A woman, dressed in worn exploring leathers and tough black boots with a belt of knifes and a pack slung over her back, finishing the last few bites of an apple. The flesh, I noticed was pitch black. My eyes kept sliding off of it. \n\nAt first I would have described her as average in every way, until she looked at me. Those eyes, somehow every color at once, were definitely not average. \n\n“About time,” she drawled. “Took you forever to get out here.”\n\nShe didn’t seem like the torturer I was expecting. “Oh. I’m…. Sorry?”\n\n“Hmm. You should be. Not everyone gets a personal escort, you know.”  She threw the core of the apple into the street. Through the mist, I saw a passing carriage horse step on it and crumple to the ground. \n\n“I didn’t know I was expected somewhere,” I said slowly. Never had I thought that any afterlife would welcome me, soaked with blood as my soul was. \n\n“Not ‘expected’, exactly. Like I said, most people don’t get a reception from me like this. But you’ve been one of mine for so long that I thought it was deserved.” She smiled, and it was a terrible and beautiful sight. “You’ve guided so many into my embrace, death dealer.”\n\n“It was a job,” I said. “Nothing more.” \n\n“I know. It’s not often I get the dispassionate ones like you. Now, shall we?”  She snapped her fingers, and the horse that had just died appeared in front of us in a flash of every-colored light. The beast shook its head in surprise, but she soothed it with a caress and a murmured word. \n\n“Shall we what?” I asked, confused. \n\n“Shall we get going? The Journey is long.”\n\n“What journey?”\n\n“The one all souls take when their time comes.” She swung into the horse’s back with a smooth motion, and extended a hand. \n\nI hesitated. “Where are we going?” \n\n“Now, that depends on you.” She smiled that terrible smile again, and I felt the world quake. “Every Journey is as different as the one that takes it. You can go alone if you want.” \n\nI lived and died alone, despite how much my heart ached for a companion. I reached up. I had always wanted to be an adventurer, but circumstances had dictated otherwise. Still, I paused. Could I trust this?\n\n“What will we see?” The question slipped out as I thought it. \n\nDeath’s eyes flashed with that ever-colored light. \n\n“Things more beautiful and terrible than you could ever imagine,” she replied. \n\nI grasped her hand.",

He pulled out various scrolls, books and slabs, then placed them all together.\n\n\"What...\" I started.\n\n\"Your life.\"\n\n\"...what?\"\n\n\"Slabs are important events.

It's that-well, even celestial beings eventually fade of their own volition.\"\n\nI could feel my eyes widened.\n\n\"Alas,\" he started \"if this was my eternity - seeing souls gone too soon so often...\" he looked to the ground, wiping at his eye.\n\n\"I...I didn't know.\"\n\nHe nodded, \"none do. You...you *can* try and get a miracle, when we get further up, but...\" there was a long pause \"...most don't...is all I'll say...\"\n\nI took a breath, and said \"...ok...\" and placed my hand on his. The books, scrolls, slabs, all shone either with the majority of the righteous gold, or a minority sad, hideous red, all upon the slabs...and a single scroll, as they streamed to our bodies.\n\nEvery moment...my life...my eyes...every single...other races say they their lives flash, but we don't...Aeglish don't, is this why?\n\nAs the streaming ceased, I recoiled back, with my body, now a glowing golden form.\n\nDeath smiled, and stood, offering his hand.\n\n\"What happened?\"\n\n\"You passed.\"",

I felt whole again but with a lightness I reveled in.\n\nI looked down at my physical corpse, the rotted hole where my nose used to be. One eye socket leaking puss, wisps of hair on my scalp. I looked truly horrid. The last thirty years in a hospital bed trapped in my own mind, paralyzed, leaking liquids God never meant the human body to secrete. \n\nWhy my family persisted in keeping me alive, trapped, tortured, I could not fathom. I hated them for leaving me alive, singing by my bedside those monotonous songs. My existence was pure hell. \n\nI look around me as everything fades, the nurse covering my body, members of my family standing still in their black clothes and white blouses or shirts.  Eerily, before I fade into the hereafter, they all, as one, look directly in my direction as if they could see my spirit. Is it possible to have chills run along your spine after you’ve moved on? Something bad awaited me. Something for worse than the hell I experienced dying slowly for thirty years. How could that be possible?\n\n“Ah, there you are, son,” I heard from behind. I spun around, or shifted. It was unclear but I faced my nemesis. She wore a flowing silk dress, her features skeletal. Then she morphed in front of me. \n\n“Mother?” She was a dead ringer for my mom. “Are you here to lead me to Hell?”\n\nOh, she spoke into my mind, you have no idea what awaits you, my great, great descendant. My apprentice. You see, she continued, you were born into a cursed family. We are the gatekeepers of the afterlife. We are the wardens of life and death. Without us, existence would not be possible. It is a great responsibility. \n\nShe stood before me in a flash. I could feel heat radiate from her presence.\n\nWe are death, she said. You will learn from me before you replace me. Your first lessons were during your life learning the suffering of humanity. Now you will learn how to transition people from one existence to another. And when this path I have chosen for you becomes unbearable, you will choose the next in line from our generation to suffer the same fate as you during life in preparation to become your apprentice. \n\n“You selected me for this?” I asked, horrified. \n\nIf not you, as they say, then who. But you still have much to learn, come now. \n\n“What if I choose to refuse?”\n\nThen I will afflict your only daughter with the curse you have just experienced for thirty years, and maybe she will be more empathetic to our plight.\n\n“No. You wouldn’t dare.”\n\nIt was done to me, and it was done to your father who refused to apprentice. So yes, she would be the next in line. \n\n“Enough, I will not subject my little girl to such horrors that befell me. Let us go. Teach me about death what I haven’t already learned in life.”\n\nDeath smiled, her tender touch further unnerving me, as I began my transformation to replace her.",

That was probably a bad sign.  He looked down to see how badly he was hurt.\n\nHe saw himself standing over his body, lying broken, crumpled, mangled, and bleeding on the roadway.  It took him a few moments to process.  He was dead?  There wasn't an afterlife, so he was pretty sure he couldn't actually be dead, but it sure seemed like that was the case.  He blinked, took a breath, and tried to clear his mind.\n\nA portly, middle-aged man, balding, strode up to him.  \n\n\"Anthony!

Welcome aboard!\" Steve beamed.\n\n\"What did I do to deserve hell?!\" Anthony exploded.\n\nThere was a long pause, the vague shadows of bodies walking around and through them.\n\n\"Umm... yeah.  So, you're assigned to the Software Engineering, which is adjunct to Heaven.  You'll be given a nice apartment, about 1000 square feet, with all the amenities. Full gym, swimming pool, perfect weather every day.  Oh, and walking distance to the office, and anything else you might want to do after work.

        "body": "The sun was out, birds were chirping, the flowers were budding or already in bloom. The cool breeze blew across my face as I laid down for the last time.  I was given a chance to find my own place to rest near a creek which water flowed as the noise it made was soothing. I just watched the water that passed by as it flowed to its next destination. My destination on the other hand, was elsewhere. Being told what to believe in was one thing but at my own end, I knew not what to expect. Thoughts wandered as I began to think of other deaths rather than my soon-to-be own. \n\nIn this place, I knew that the orcs saw a great, Black Warrior who could never be defeated. The proud orcs would try with all their might against death until they wore out and gave up. This was their dance to perform for Death, who in turn, performed back.  Their duet into the afterlife was hard, but well-respected by other cultures, as their end was the greatest battle they would have. Their legends spoke of the early Orcs who fought against death and won, but nothing was ever proven.\n\nElves had their own death to look forward to after their long lives. Death was a graceful maiden who kindly offered their hand out to the newly dead. Upon taking death’s hand, you were to rise in full-strength, give her a gentle bow in respect, and walk away with her into the afterlife. There was at least one who studied the religions of Elves and proposed that the maiden would have the dead dance as well. Ancient dances were performed by just walking and holding hands, but nothing of the recent sort. \n\nThe last one coming to my mind were the Humans. Humans had the grim reaper who held a scythe and motioned their finger towards the newly dead. These people who refused were forced to dance all the way to the afterlife without stopping as punishment. Those who challenged Death were typically forced to dance for longer in place before they could begin moving. Only those who accepted the reaper were allowed to move at their own pace, but nothing of the wild dances which were told about.\n\nI never met any of those reapers, but if I had my choice? The elven one was the best. To be able to stand up, hold a hand of a friendly face and move on would be best. I was not given the capacity to fight beyond words and to dance for the reaper did not feel possible with how things were looking.  My mind wandered for another moment as the gurgling of the creek diminished and my eyes fully closed. It was then that I fell into a deep, final dream.\n\nThe dream began in an attic with me hovering over a box which opened and grew to be taller than I was by nearly triple in height.  The ceiling of the attic vanished as the front of the box opened to reveal a brilliant maple tree with leaves beginning to scatter over its bottom. A boy moved from the other side of the tree and decided to sit and pointed towards another corner of the box. I did not notice what was there until he pointed, revealing two adults who were in a catatonic state appeared in that exact spot.\n\n“Hey!” I called out to the boy, stepping forward, “Hey! You!” I started to try and run towards the tree instead of the adults. If I were correct, the tree was where I needed to go. The adults on the other hand, were a trap, as they were those who did something awful. I did not know why this was fact, but dreams were hard to interpret. As I approached the tree, it grew hundreds of feet in the moment, taking the boy into the sky with it and soon, I was left at the foot of the maple’s colossal base. “It’s just my imagination…” I got out, trying to assist myself with this last dream. I was not going to allow this dream to turn into a nightmare.\n\nIt was then that the boy somehow reappeared beside me, also looking up. “Didja know that mighty trees take multiple lifetimes to grow?” He turned to me and exclaimed while a grin had formed on his lips, “And you grew tall!” Their hands spread up from them as if showing how big and wide I would be.\n\n“Yeah, I know.” I replied. Pursing my lips, I shook my head before replying to the comment. “But to die at such a young age like I did, how can you claim that I grew like that?” I froze after feeling I had control of my body once more. I looked to where the adults had been, but they were no longer there. I had thought about death many times and the afterlife, but I needed ask. “Are you death?”\n\nThe boy’s wide arms turned on me and gave me a tight hug as I froze. This was it, this was the end. It was then that he released his grip and just looked up to me. “You gave up on your desires long ago to achieve what others wanted. To that point, they died, but they came back because of you.” He explained. “This is the thirtieth day and you have had more than twenty-nine brethren before you. Some had longer lives, but each were visited by me, yet I could never take them to the beyond.”\n\n“What about me?” I asked hesitantly, “Am I the first to move on?”\n\n\n“No.” The boy then laughed and stepped back to the tree and motioned me over to it. “Your death is simply the end of this story. Your life was given to you by the eyes who read these words. Your rebirth is the most important part; the joy you brought to the one who created you.”\n\n“What? I was so short?” I was at a loss for words. I moved over to the tree and sat as well, wondering how crazy this was sounding. “And my life given by eyes?” I stared up into the sky that started to fill with sunlight.\n\n“Like the mighty tree behind me, you are strong. Each of your siblings added to this, and you have as well.” I heard the boy stand up and moved to be in front of me, extending his hand outwards. “Come. We wish to hear about your life on the other side of this tree.” He then grabbed my hand I felt compelled to walk with him around the massive base.\n\n“Will any of them come back to life?” I asked as we began walking. “Will I return back from the dead?”\n\n“We shall see.” The boy intoned, “We shall certainly see.”\n\nWith that, I took his hand, stood up, and followed him to the other side of the tree, joining the other stories that were written.\n\nThe other side of the tree was just as grand. It was nighttime on this other side. Stars were twinkling in the sky, the moon shone down, and the same creek I had laid near was in sight. Seats were placed around a glowing campfire as I saw dozens of other faces. There were other forms of death, a few men, a few women, a gargoyle, two parents reading a children’s story to a child, and an archway in the distance that glowed with arcane runes.\n\nI took a look up to the moon once more, swearing I saw something on it move.\n\n“Come on! Get over here!” Someone shouted. I looked back to the gathering of those who sat, and they all looked at me. The boy was gone, but in their place, it was a copy of myself, offering a seat to me. I ventured forward to one of the empty seats, but glanced, seeing more seats than others in the collective group.\n\n“Sit here.” The other me stated, gesturing to one chair that was positioned itself close to the others. “You are the final story of this set, but you are not the last story. The tree will grow as shall those here. Share your story here and look forward to when we are joined by others.”\n\nI took the seat as I was pointed to and smiled sheepishly to the others who had their gaze set upon me. “Well, uh, hello.”\n\nThe others almost in unison called back, “Hello to you too!” Though that was what I heard. I am certain that other words were used by many, and not all was spoken by voice alone.\n\n“Let me tell you about my life, and how it started by a creek, thinking about death of Orcs and Elves.” I began, weaving the tale of my short, yet good life.\n\n(I found this story fitting for my Day 30 of 30 self-imposed writing a short story a day challenge. This Writing Prompt was incredibly perfect for it. Thank you for the chance to write in here.)\n\n(Edited because it missed one specific word that without it, made less sense. Whoops!)",

If understanding were the most delicious cheese sandwich ever devised, I was only one that was deathly lactose intolerant. It wasn't that I sat down, exactly.

I mean, I'd read that orcs get a black warrior that can't be defeated, elves get a graceful maiden, heck, there was a tree that even got the wind!\"\n\nShe paused, her eyes wide in- was it shock? Amazement? Recognition, maybe? Something I said must've struck a chord with her, because she looked off to the side again. \"...they're all me, to be honest. I know, this isn't what you expected. I've been the face of someone's friend that passed away long before they did, I've been a dark skinnned leathered up woman, I've even been someone's reflection before.

I was never a-\"\n\n\"A fan?\" She smiled and nodded at that. \"I know. A lot of people weren't fans. A lot of people were, too. But being a fan isn't enough to make me who I am. If it were, there'd have been a lot of really bizarre encounters with people who liked things I won't even get into here.\"  \n\nI gaped as she blushed at that - blushed! - but I knew she was telling the truth. I always had that sort of sixth sense about me, it'd saved me from a lot of bad situations in college. And, from that one creep that kept following me home from work, too. I live over there, he'd said, pointing an empty house the street over from me, but like I said, it was an empty house. No one lived there. I'd thought about calling the police a few times when I kept running into him, but he'd always kept his distance. ...hadn't he?\n\n\"...so! Are you ready? It's not far from here..\" She turned and glanced behind her, her wings fluttering for a moment, and I could have sworn I caught the scent of parchment and lavender from her. \"...if we hurry, we'll be there before sunset.\n\n\"...you mean... what comes next?\"  I look down at my hands again. \"I don't even know how I got here, or where 'here' is.\"\n\n\"Oh, that's understandable,\" she said quietly, making her way next to me before sitting down on the ground. \"You've been through a lot already just to get here. Maybe it's something you want to talk about?\"\n\n\"I would if I could remember- wait...\" I narrowed my eyes for a moment, thoughts bubbling to the surface. \"I remember there was this weirdo, he was following me home every day. But he never got too close, he was just always there. Heh, and then the last night he was't there at all, and I remember thinking how nice it felt to not have to deal with him for once. I got my keyes out, I unlocked the front door, and... and...\"\n\nShe reached out and gently touched my foot, then looked up at me as I felt my mind twist and warp and contort so hard that I thought I was going to die. Well, you know, except for the fact I was already dead. \"...go on, I'm listening.\"\n\n\"...I heard his voice... I turned... he'd gotten inside somehow..\" I slowly curled up as I shivered all over.  \"...he killed me, didn't he.\"\n\nShe bowed her head towards me almost apologetically, her voice now a whisper. \"...yes. That is what happened, unfortunately. I'm really sorry about it. I wish I could've done something, but they won't let me intervene in situations like that. 'These things are not for you to decide, only to guide.' That's what sunbutt always told me, but it doesn't make it any easier.\"\n\n\"Sunbutt?\" I laughed, and it dawned on me, I hadn't actually laughed in a long time. It felt good, warmed me from head to toes as I sat in the grass next to her. \"You really called her sunbutt?\"\n\n\"Oh, never to her face, no way, could you imagine?!\" She stifled a giggle of her own. \"You have any idea how many letters I'd have had to write if she knew? Oh stars...!\" \n\n\"Yeah... yeah... can't imagine that would've ever made it to a kid's show, huh.\" I smiled and reached out my hand to her.  \"The name's Riley, but you can call me Riles. I guess that means you're Death, huh.\"\n\n\"Mmm... more like a guide, don't you think?\" She winked at me, and I watched the way her tail flicked, and the way her ears perked.  \"Feeling better, now?\"\n\nI stood to my feet and stretched out again, sighing. \"I suppose I am, as well as any dead woman could be. So where am I headed anyway?\"\n\n\"Oh, you are going to love this next part,\" she told me, her mane bouncing for a moment as she glanced behind her. The sun was low in the sky but hadn't quite reached the horizon yet. \"See, you're one of the few that gets to chose. But the fact that I'm here, in this form, already?\" She rose to all four hooves, and nudged my side playfully. \"Seems to me you already decided. So you ready to meet the others?\"\n\n\"...but I wasn't a-\"\n\n\"Oh, please, you can hide it all you want, we both know you were.\" She reached out a hoof and touched my chest, where my heart would've been beating.  \"In here, all along. And that's good enough for the next.\"\n\n\"...damn, caught.\"  I laughed and folded my arms behind my head as she trotted a few steps ahead of me, then glanced back to make sure I was still following. \"So, am I going to be a human still, or...?\"\n\n\"You sure you want to find out now, or would you rather experience it?\" \n\nI grinned widely. She had my number, but then, she'd always been one of the brighest, and most gifted. At least, as far as the show had told us. \"...right, experience it is, lead on.\"\n\nThat, my friend, is how it was that I learned that life and death are so much more malleable than anyone could have ever guessed. All it takes is reading between the lines, and you'll get it.\n\nOh, the name of my new mysterious guide? But you already know that, don't you.\n\nAfter all, you've got that same Spark in you, too.",

        "body": "I died and what I found was definitely the last thing I expected.  I was sitting on a giant conveyor belt with more people then I'd ever seen and it seemed to stretch infinitely behind me.  In front of me though as crane picking up some but not all, and the end of the conveyor belt.  Those who fell screamed and it was horrible.  I looked over the sides but only darkness. I paced back and forth.  I knew I had died, after all one doesn't survive the kind of execution my country uses.  So the question was what was This?  I looked as far as my eyes could stretch but only more darkness.  Eventually though I was at the front and I like many others got picked up by the crane.  As it transferred me through the darkness I could see the drop off of the conveyor belt, leading to a pair of crushing rollers that looked designed to destroy some of the toughest materials.  I did not envy those who fell off.  Just past the crusher I could see the word Disentanglement.\n\n\n\nI was appreciative of the fact I wasn't being disentangled but I wasn't sure that where I was headed would be better.  I saw it soon enough though.  A large chute that people were being dropped into.  Above it in bright neon lights as if it was meant to be a welcoming sight after a long night Evaluation.  I supposed that was preferable.  Though what would be evaluated by simply dropping us into a shoot I couldn't imagine.  Still as I fell into it I did feel a sense of calm.  It wasn't like falling it was more like floating, just leisurely floating on the ocean or perhaps down a lazy river ride.  I don't know how long I spent there but eventually I was let out onto yet another conveyor belt.  On this one far less people then before and no screaming to be heard.  \n\n\n\nAnother sign stood bright on one side of us.  This one seemingly made of light, nothing holding it in place.  Adjustments.  As we moved down the tiny orbs were dropped onto or should I say into us.  I watched some try to dodge them but most were content to let this machine do as it wished after such a relaxing time.  I considered trying to move but honestly it seemed so much effort and I was so relaxed that I simply let the tiny glowing orb drop onto my chest.  As it did I saw it's color change and I felt something in me shifting.  I couldn't explain what but even that nagging voice suggesting I act against the machine was gone.\n\n\n\nSoon enough we hit the end of this conveyor belt and fell into what appeared to be a sieve, one big enough to hold so many people.  It seemed to have holes barely big enough for a person to slide through if they stood straight and pinned their arms to their sides.  I looked upwards and a large mechanical arm swung down.  Written on the side of it in white paint was.  Testing.  It began to shake the sieve and I didn't really care for the shaking and simply wanted out so I straightened and fell through.  As I did I saw some clinging to sides or desperately crawling to avoid the holes while those who stayed just lying down also did not slip through.  Yet more of us gone, only a few left.  I didn't know what it meant but only felt curiosity about it.  There was no worry for me, even though perhaps in another life I would have been panicked by all that had occurred.\n\n\n\nWe were on yet another conveyor belt this time.  Above us floating once more in giant letters was the word Hallowing.  I knew that word, it had never really applied to my life so I had no idea what to expect here.  Then it came, first a light misting of something that was like water but somehow different, it felt almost like air at the perfect temperature but at the same time like an ideal shower with the perfect pressure applied.  Then a light that seemed soft and welcoming briefly shown before revealing a giant man with a clip board, glancing down.  Occasionally picking up one of my fellow passengers on this strange ride, hmming over them and setting them back down.  As I passed him I saw on his lanyard and ID badge, I couldn't make out his name, but only his title D.E.A.T.H. Quality Inspector.",

This time, though, that irrational and instinctual self preservation instinct is nowhere to be found. I step to the ledge, and jump again. Over and over and over until I come up on someone else waiting their turn to jump. Or at least, looks like they're waiting their turn.\n\nNow I'm in line waiting. Waiting for what feels like forever. \"Come on, lady,\" I groan as I march around her to get her attention.\n\nExcept, she's not a lady. Just a short pudgy goth kid still in most of her school uniform. Short and pudgy she pushes her big owl rim glasses up her round cheeks and button nose to get a better look at me. When the glare on the thick lenses fades I spy the bags under her eyes, marred by two-day old eyeshadow, and disheveled curls dangle in front of her face like wiry springs. Their ginger roots plainly visible from the dye being unmaintained, and freckles poking through gaps in her foundation.\n\n\"keklamao\" is all I hear as I turn to leave and it freezes me solid.\n\n\"What the fuck did you say to me?\" I turn and she's pointing over the edge.\n\n\"kek lamo ROFLCOPTER no fly, boss.\" she says again in her weird, ancient, and dead language.\n\nI can't make out what she's trying to communicate as my eyes trace her arm, out to her extended finger, and to where she's pointing. It's me. Floating away in the river. I'm there looking back up at the bridge with her standing on it. A rustle in the water and rocks causes me to turn abruptly only to catch the very same finger on my nose. \"Boop your snoot!\" she laughs and I fall over backwards.\n\n\"What the hell is happening!?\" I scream in a panic.\n\n       ROFL:ROFL:ROFL:ROFL      \n             ___^___ _  \n     L    __/      []  \\     \n    LOL===__            \\   \n     L      \\___ ___ ___ ]             \n               I   I       \n             ----------/\n\nIs her only reply as she grabs my collar and carries me away.",

What I wasn’t expecting were the dark bags under his eyes, the greasy, unkempt hair under his hat, and the… Wendy’s uniform?\n\n“I’m sorry, but are you sure you wore the right uniform to work today?” I asked. “Not that you need a black robe and scythe to do your job, but does a Wendy’s uniform make it any easier?”\n\nHis tired sigh seemed to shake the space around us, a gray, monotone expanse for as far as the eye could see. Even Death appeared in black and white, like some old school television graphics.\n\n“Death isn’t just one entity, flying around the globe collecting lost souls like an old woman collects cats. I’m a representation of your death, a manifestation of the way you lived and died. When a soldier dies, they might see death as a general welcoming them to their final post. A musician might see a conductor, congratulating them on their last performance. You, though? You got a fast food employee. What do you think that says about you?”\n\nI let out a nervous laugh, trying to hide the sudden unease that lodged itself in my stomach. I felt sweat beading on my brow, even though I was fairly certain I was past the discomforts of a physical body at this point.\n\n“I haven’t worked as a fast food employee in decades,” I said, trying to deflect. “Why not an office manager or a CEO? God knows how many hours I’ve spent in a cubicle somewhere, regardless of whatever floor they promoted me to.”\n\n“Well you said it yourself. All those years slaving away in one cubicle after another, working on higher floors for bigger paychecks, all for what? You replaced your old friends with work connections, gave your wife a paycheck instead of a real husband, showed up more on overtime ledgers than in your own kids’ lives.”\n\nDeath’s expression hadn’t even flickered as he laid my life bare, peeled my life apart fact by fact.\n\n“You stopped living your own life the second you listened to people telling you how to live it. I’m here as a fast food employee because that was the last time you felt like your life was your own. I might have only come for you now, but you stopped living long before I ever came your way.”",

A good one though. Worth it, even now lying in this bed, watching sunset and moonrise through the window, breathing,  waiting.\n\nLong ago I used to dance beneath the moon. When I was young I'd leap and spin till the silver light sank beneath the horizon. But I found something better than the dance. I put aside the moonlight nights and replaced them with decades in sunlight and it was so very good.\n\nI will not lie though.

        "body": "Tiffany stopped climbing, brow furrowed in confusion as she reread the sign. “What could possibly be so bad about heaven?”\n\nOf course, nobody was there to answer her question. Disregarding the message with a shrug, Tiffany continued her climb. It seemed God intended the climb up to heaven to be a solitary one, so Tiffany had plenty of time to wonder what the sign might mean as she continued.\n\nReaching the top, Tiffany grumbled to herself about her burning legs. She hadn’t been aware that spirits even existed, let alone that they could feel fatigued. She looked around and was amazed at what she saw. Before her was a beautiful valley, dotted with houses as far as the eye could see. Running through the valley’s middle was a river of crystal clear water, the cleanest she’d ever seen. Tiffany idly wondered if it’d turn to wine if Jesus were to take a bath.\n\n“You know, if that were any less amusing I’d have you sent back down for blasphemy” a voice to her right startled Tiffany out of her musings.\n\n“Saint Peter?” She asked, a slight fear gripping her heart as she understood that she was about to be judged.\n\n“Indeed, Tiffany. It seems that you know something about what's about to happen, at least.”\n\nTiffany began to sweat slightly, wringing her hands. It was a nervous tic she’d had since middle school, and the idea of having her whole life judged in a single moment was certainly nerve wracking.\n\nSuddenly, Tiffany’s life began to flash before her eyes at a rapid pace. Not her entire life was considered, just her sins and good deeds. Tiffany had thought she’d lived a good, if unremarkable, life, and hoped she’d be deemed worthy of heaven.\n\nAfter a few minutes of silence, Saint Peter finally spoke. “Congratulations, Tiffany. You are worthy to proceed through these gates. However, I must warn you that should you do so, you will not be able to leave easily.”\n\nTiffany stiffened slightly, remembering the sign she’d disregarded on the way up. Deciding she’d rather be informed if possible, she asked “Why would someone choose to leave? Isn’t heaven supposed to be perfect?”\n\n“Boredom, I believe. Some people find a sinless life to be rather dull, and we’ve had some rather impressive breakouts over the millennia. I hope you find Heaven to your liking, Tiffany. We wouldn’t want a scandal on our hands” Saint Peter replied, adopting an ominous tone at the end.\n\nTiffany shivered slightly, his last sentence causing her to wonder what they did to those who tried to escape. She decided not to ask, hoping she’d never find out. She knew an eternity away from God was considered a punishment in itself, so maybe they let them leave, figuring that was enough? She pushed the thoughts away before she could consider any darker possibilities.\n\nTaking a deep breath, Tiffany made her choice. “I’ll go in” she stated, hoping she sounded more confident than she felt.\n\nWith a pleased smile, Saint Peter opened the gate for her. It almost seemed weightless, requiring no force for him to move. Tiffany knew her friend Brandon, a carpenter, would have several questions for Peter about how to make hinges so silent. He’d always complained that anytime he installed a door, the hinges would squeak. Tiffany thought he must be doing something wrong, as none of the doors in her house were squeaky. However, she’d always kept that to herself, not wanting to hurt his feelings.\n\nWaving her on, Saint Peter told her “You’ll know where to go once you pass through the gates.”\nTiffany took a hesitant step forward, a confused expression on her face. As soon as she crossed the threshold, it was replaced with a look of awe. A thin blue line shone on the path before her, leading the way in the distance. As the gate closed behind her, Tiffany knew there was only one way for her to go. With legs still sore from the climb up to Heaven, she walked at a sedate pace towards her predetermined destination.\n\nAs she walked, Tiffany took note of her surroundings. The valley was even more beautiful from within, as the lush forests on the side of the mountains were much more visible from up close. The path led along the riverbank, bridges occasionally crossing to the other bank. She saw many people on her journey, some relaxing in their lawns, conversing with their friends and neighbors. Others were swimming in the river, playing games or walking along the path. Tiffany noticed that no matter what they were doing, everybody had a contented smile on their face, as though nothing had gone wrong for them in quite some time.\n\nFinally reaching the end of the line, Tiffany gasped as she saw her beloved grandmother. Running up to her, Tiffany engulfed her in a hug. “Grandma, I’ve missed you so much!”\n\n“As have I, dear. I hope your life was good after I passed?”\n\n“Yes, it was wonderful. I met a lovely man not long after you died, and lived a happy life with him and our children.”\n\nSuddenly, her grandma’s face grew slightly sad. “Tiffany, I should tell you that you may never see him again. It’s anybody’s guess where someone’s family lives up here. Why, I haven’t seen my Henry a single time!”\n\nTiffany was shocked. Suddenly, she understood why one might want to leave. For some, an eternity away from someone they loved could be a punishment of its own. She hoped she’d be able to bear it.\n\nHer grandma spoke up again, “Yes, I can see it in your face. Those of us who can’t find our partners are often among those who try to leave. Even I tried to leave once, although I wasn’t determined enough to see it through. I hope you can learn to live without him, like I did.”\n\nTiffany gulped. It seemed like the biggest challenge of her life would be learning to live with the afterlife.\n\n\nThis is the first writing I've ever posted, hope you enjoy! :)",

        "body": "In a brilliant flash of flame and a great deal of smoke, I had been summoned once again. My suit was gonna smell like brimstone again, damnit. I REALLY needed to talk to Dad about a better summoning process, this is ridiculous, third fucking suit this week. \n\n\"U-um, hi. Are you a demon? Like, f-from hell?\" the voice came from a small girl, maybe 10 or 11. Beside her stood, I'm assuming, her mother. \n\n\"Yeah, I'm Azarial. And you summoned me to grant you a wish, hmm?\" I smiled and tilted my head.\n\nThe mother spoke up this time. \"I'm Jenna, and this is Hailey. We're willing to trade our souls if you can completely ruin her father. See, he cheated, betrayed us both.\"\n\n\"Daddy breaked Mommy's heart! I want you to punish him!\" the girl had a temper on her, that's for sure. \n\nSuddenly, a unique scent flowed into my nostrils, warm and rich and gooey. It distracted me for a moment, and I didn't even realize I was speaking out loud. \"Is that nacho cheese? Damn, I haven't had nachos in fucking forever.\" \n\nI was suddenly hit with a tiny pink flipflop. The little girl glared at me, body trembling, face twisted in a scowl. \"You said a bad word! 'pologize to Mommy!\" She had a temper on her, that's for sure.\n\nThis is where I might be different from the other demons back home. They're all about collecting souls, and manipulating mortals, and all that other shit. What use do I have for souls? Huh? But I do have a weakness for mortal food. Like, you know how angels are all 'God is great?' and the other demons are all, 'Give me your soul!' and there are some humans out there that are almost the same way, almost like an addiction of sorts? Yeah, me and mortal food. I leaned in close, flashing my warmest smile.\n\n\"You make me a plate of those nachos, and I'll apologize to Mommy AND punish your father. Promise. No soul trading today.\" \n\nI swear, by my own blood, I never saw someone move so fast, much kess a ten-year-old girl. Within a minute, I had a plate of hot nachos, piled high with beans and rice and meat and cheese and sourcream and diced tomatoes and guacamole. I lifted one of the chips to my mouth, and smiled happily. Nachos weren't my favorite, but they were certainly up there. My eyes closed in bliss, and I let out a soft sigh of happiness. \n\n\"So be it. We'll plan your father's demise tomorrow, yeah? But first, nachos! And I'm sorry for my foul language earlier,\" I laughed as I sat down in the middle of the summoning circle, munching happily. \"So tell me about this man, yeah? We're gonna make this totally personal now.\"\n\nI had FUCKING NACHOS! I was gonna make this guy suffer, over a plate of nachos. Worth every bite.",

        "body": "\"Look, I do not want another soul.\" The demon screeches out. Despite its eldritch-like tone, Samara can hear the emphasis on Do Not. She was confused. In every single summoning guide, it states clearly that a demon would want your soul as payment. Nobody had ever even suggested that other forms of payment could be possible. Her mind ran through every worse case scenario - does it want eternal labour? Or her firstborn? She wasn't sure, and she definitely didn't want to keep guessing. \n\n\"So, what do you want then?\" She managed to squeak out,expecting the worst. \n\n\"I've seen humans of your origin eating this strange cultural delight, I believe they are called Mazza balls?\" The demon sounded more human now. It's harsh feelings clearly subdued.\n\n\"Do - do you mean Matzo balls?\" Confusion spread across Samara's face. She never would've guessed a demon would want dinner. \n\n\"Yes! Yes, that! I want that. I will give you all the fame and beauty you desire for those. And also maybe some Challah? I believe that's come from your culture as well.\"\n\nSamara shook her head. She couldn't believe a demon was asking her to make food she hadn't had since childhood. \"Well, I suppose I can do that. Do you have any dietary restrictions?\" She giggled slightly, grasping how ridiculous of a deal this was. \n\n\"Well,\" the demon sunk down into itself, pausing in thought. \" I have never liked those bug things - you know, worms and beetles and the like. It's too slimy for me.\" \n\nSamara nodded. \"You'll have to give me until the weekend to have this all made for you, but if you can come back Saturday, I suppose we have a deal.\"\n\nThe demon nodded, murmuring \"saturday\" as it disappeared into small flames. \n\nSo Saturday came. Samara placed two tubs in the centre of the summoning circle she'd made days earlier - one tub full of matzo ball soup and the other containing a small loaf of Challah. Both her mothers' recipes are purely from memory, though. She could never explain to her mother that the reason she had finally taken an interest in Jewish cuisine was a demon who had promised her fame and beauty. \n\nAs if on cue, the demon appeared. It brandished a shiny golden contract in one hand and a small spoon in the other. \n\n\"Thank you.\" It mumbled, the eldritch tones in its voice making it difficult to understand. \"Just sign here.\" It motioned to a section at the bottom of the contract with a flaming tendril Samara had not noticed before.\n\nSamara grabbed a pen and scribbled her signature down. \"I hope the food is to your liking.\" She smiled, and the demon nodded.\n\n\"That is all.\" The demon bowed slightly, or at least to Samara, it looked like a bow. Then it disappeared, taking both tubs and the contract with it.",

Strong in force and strong flight he was. Such potential he had, but loved his mother, he did,”\n\nLuke felt his face twist. His mind drifted to Aunt Beru.\n\n“What’s wrong with loving your mom?” Luke said, a little louder than he meant to.\n\n“Not the problem that was. Attached to his mother Anakin was,” Yoda continued, “Feared her loss he did. Angry once he lost her Anakin was. Changed him it did. Feared more loss he did. Drew him to dark side fear did,”\n\nYoda took a deep breath. A frown had come over his face. He looked away from Luke. Luke didn’t have the strength to look back. Luke knew little of his father. He’d had an image of his father when he was a kid. The profession would change sometimes his dad was a pod racer, sometimes a rebel and other times he was just moisture farmer but Luke always imagined his dad was tall and blonde. He never imagined his dad had gone through so much.\nLuke wondered if that kid was still inside Vader. \n\n“Save him you cannot!” Yoda yelled. “Gone Anakin is. Vader all there is. To try and save him foolish you would be!”\n\n“That’s why I’ll do it,” Luke said.",

Be home for dinner!\" the creature said, waving towards the opening, where I could just see the...hand? of another creature.  \nI ran back inside.\n\n  \n\"So? Is it deadly? Is it still on-going?\" the others asked.  \nI shook my head.  \n\"It is safe, at least concerning the eruptions, and the covered skies.  \nThe sun is shining, and the air is almost toxic, but bearable.  \nBut...\" I started.  \nThey shook when they heard that \"but\".  \n\"But there is a civilization that appeared.  \nA civilization of bipedal creatures like us, but clearly not evolved from our ancestors, or reptilians, or birds for that matter.\" I said.  \nThey paled with fright.\n\n  \n\"Mammals? Those little fast-evolving ones are already a civilization?  \nIt has been only a few dozen million years!\" one of them said.  \nI nodded gravely.  \n\"Yeah, they were always fast to adapt by changing completely.  \nIt took us 150 million years to become what we are, creating a civilization underground, and hidden in plain sight aboveground.  \nBut now, it doesn't matter, what matters is...  \nI sensed a lot of food for us, and that these bipedal creatures are intelligent and able to communicate.  \nShall we try it out? Or should we just wake up our brethren, and live underground only?\" I asked.  \nThey fell silent.  \nWe debated this for days, but we couldn't reach an agreement.  \nIt was hard. Having to deal with another civilization.",

A deaf one.  \nAnd I hoped you can help me get away from the cyclops following me.\" she muttered.  \nI hit her in the throat with my staff, and then knocked her out completely.  \nI left her behind, as I led my sheep with Argie's help peacefully away.  \nI get home, to see an Owl, an Eagle, a Vulture, a Deer and a Swan, loitering around my fence.  \nIgnoring them, I go inside my house.  \n\"Here Argie.\" I said, giving fresh water, and food to Argie, before going outside.  \nI sigh.  \nDamn Gods...I just want a normal life.\n\n\n\n\"You just killed the Amazonian princess.\" the Owl hooted.  \n\"Knocked her out.\" I corrected her.  \n\"Leaving her to be taken, and toyed with by the cyclops, before they eat her.\" the Vulture cawed in.  \nI shrugged.  \n\"It is the 9th event this week you avoid.  \nWhen you will get into your mortal brain? You have been Chosen. You can't...\" the eagle screeched, shaking the air around me.  \nThat was about enough Gods for today, so I ignored them, and went inside.  \nA terrible storm started...just around my farm.  \nPetty Gods.\n\n\n\nLive a normal life, with a wife, and a couple of kids I can make happy, that was all I ever wanted.  \nNothing more, nothing less.  \nBut the Gods had other plans, as seen before.  \nAlways throwing at me impossible scenarios, monsters, demigods, or fallen Gods to help.  \nI refuse to.  \nThose outside? Athena, Zeus, Ares, Artemis, and Apollo, trying to convince me.  \nThey won't.  \nBeing a Hero is a life worse than death, and if push comes to shove.   \nThe underworld has some plains, and fields...  \nI think Hades would accept me, even if just to spite Olympus.  \nArgie came over, resting his head on my lap.  \nI smiled, then sighed...  \nHades likes dogs, right?",

        "body": "Will sighed, taking a pail of dark water from its place on his doorstep. He reached his hand into the water's surface, drawing out a rough sponge. He shook cinders out of his hair, cleared the soot from his eyes. The black ash fell from his wrists as he sponged them. He lifted his frayed shirt over his head, tugging at it lazily when it became stuck around his neck. The linen stitching gave out as he did so, the fabric tearing apart into two large sheets. Will dropped them to the ground, exasperated. Silly as it was, he felt embarrassed now to be half-bare on his doorstep, in plain view of any who might pass by.\n\n\nIt was rare these days for Will to see his neighbours. Most had moved out long ago, leaving houses empty. Those who hadn't moved never spoke to him, never met his gaze. Will had found his isolation highly convenient. He was glad not to be invited to the funerals anymore. He recalled feeling guilty, in the beginning. Back then, the families would try to be gentle. They'd grasp his shoulder lightly, reassure him that it wasn't his fault. But later they'd grow vile, whispering about him in the streets and gesturing prayers as he walked by. Now he found it tiresome, irritable. It WAS his fault, after all, and he was glad that people had caught on to that and kept a safe distance.\n\n\nIn the distance, the mountains boomed and the sky crackled. Will rolled his eyes, stepping inside and closing shut the heavy door. His home was bare: he kept no belongings but the bare essentials. His bookshelves sat empty, his bed unmade. The room looked frozen in time, so ready to be abandoned that it seemed like it already had been. They had destroyed his houses so many times, it was easier not to get attached. A pile of woven garments lay within his reach, and Will grabbed one at random and threw it over his thin frame. The woolen vest chafed against his skin and he tried to ignore that sensation as he did with many others.\n\n\n\"I told them that wouldn't work on you,\" spoke a gentle voice. The woman was seated at his table, the scraps of his breakfast lying beside her lily-white fingers. \"You know how it is with gods of violence. Fire and blood are the only languages they speak.\"\n\n\n\"Yes,\" Will nodded, \"and I also know the schemes of gods of love. What will you use to tempt me with this time?\"\n\n\nThe woman pouted, scrunching her face and softening her eyes, evoking the image of a kicked puppy.\n\n\n\"The boy is so mean to poor, little me, I think I might...cry,\" she said, drawing out the syllables mockingly. \n\n\nWill winced in disgust. \n\n\n\"Don't judge,\" she said, her face now starkly neutral, \"the sexy baby shtick works on most men. They either want that, or a family member. Moms and sisters, mostly. Sometimes it's dear old Daddy,\" she chuckled boyishly. \"But I couldn't try that with you, Will. I don't think you would've noticed. They were killed so long ago, I doubt you remember them.\" Her eyes stared into his, hopeful she might have pinched a nerve.\n\n\nWill sighed, disappointed. \"Yeah, yeah, my parents are dead,\" he said coldly. \"You gods are so single-minded. It's like, you've got one trick and if that doesn't work, you've got no other ideas.\"\n\n\n\"To be fair, it's a good trick!\" she grinned. \"There's nothing like a mother's corpse to turn the farm boy into a hero.\"\n\n\n\"Find someone else,\" Will said.\n\n\n\"But we've chosen you! And we don't like being denied,\" she tutted.\n\n\nWill smiled at her and her eyes flared. The woman stood suddenly, the chair falling flat behind her. Will stepped aside calmly. He opened the front door again, gesturing for her to leave. The goddess huffed.\n\n\n\"Do you know how frustrating you are!?\" she demanded. She strode up to him, her rage and desperation unveiled. \"This is for your own good! Your world, OUR world. If you don't save it, we'll all be damned.\"\n\n\nWill looked at her coldly, hollow. \"When the gods take everything from you,\" he said, \"it's only fair to choose the same for them.\"",

        "body": "The rookie was practically vibrating in his seat across from Hellhound.\n\nBright-eyed, caffeinated, and far too comfortable for someone that new, he leaned in with a grin.\n\n“So let me get this straight… you’re *Hellhound*?”\n\nHellhound—arms behind his head, boots on the table, chewing on a toothpick—smirked like the question answered itself.\n\n“Damn right.”\n\n“Dude. That’s… that’s the *coolest* thing I’ve ever heard. Like, straight out of a comic book.”\n\n“More like a horror story,” Hellhound said with a shrug. “Bad dreams and bad luck. That’s me.”\n\nThe rookie practically clapped. “Okay, okay, but you *have* to tell me—how’d you get the callsign? Was it like, a blackout op in the jungle? You tear through enemy lines, no backup, just smoke and teeth and fire?”\n\nHellhound grinned wider. “Something like that.”\n\nThen, with the quiet drama of a campfire confession, he leaned forward.\n\n“First solo refueling drill. Midair. Serious stuff. I’m lining up behind the tanker—clean, controlled, pro-level. Then…”\n\nHe paused.\n\n“…I sneeze.”\n\nThe rookie blinked. “You what?”\n\n“*Massive* sneeze. Whole-body thing. Yanks the stick. Jet veers left, hooks a wild spin, sirens going off like a slot machine on fire. I’m flailing, the tanker’s shouting, and somewhere in the middle of it all—open comms, mind you—I panic-yell *‘AAAAAOOOOOOHHH!’* like I’m turning into a werewolf. They grounded me for two weeks, and the others kept howling at me the whole time.\"\n\nThe rookie was still laughing, red in the face, nearly in tears. “That is the dumbest origin for the coolest name I’ve ever heard!”\n\nHellhound chuckled, shaking his head. “Yeah, well. Embarrassment builds character. At least I didn’t get called Twinkles or something.”\n\nThe rookie wiped his eyes. “Okay, but seriously—what about Commander Muffin? That’s gotta be a joke, right? Like… a nickname that stuck because no one had the guts to change it?”\n\nHellhound’s grin faded into something sly. He leaned in like he was about to spill the secrets of the universe.\n\n“You ever hear the phrase ‘don’t judge a book by its callsign?’”\n\nRookie nodded.\n\n“Well, Muffin… ain’t soft. You think it’s funny—until you hear what happened in Kandahar. I wasn’t there, but I’ve heard it enough times from the old dogs in the hangar. Rumor goes, his bird took an RPG to the wing, fuel line frozen mid-air, and he—”\n\nThe door slammed open.\n\nHellhound sat up straight like he’d been hit with a taser. The rookie jolted so hard he knocked over his coffee.\n\nCommander Muffin stepped into the room like the concept of death decided to wear a flight suit. Broad shoulders, squared jaw, a scar that cut across his temple like punctuation. His boots hit the floor like gunshots.\n\nHe looked between them.\n\n“Something funny?”\n\n“No, sir,” Hellhound said, voice cracking slightly as he sprang to his feet.\n\nThe rookie scrambled up beside him, mortified.\n\nMuffin stepped forward, his gaze settling on the rookie like a targeting system.\n\n“Let me guess. He was about to tell you the story.”\n\nThe rookie swallowed. “Sir?”\n\n“About Kandahar. The muffins. The rooftop.”\n\n“…Yes, sir.”\n\nMuffin nodded once. “Good. Let the myth grow. It’s the only reason half of you keep your heads down.”\n\nThen he turned to Hellhound. “And you—next time you gossip, I’ll have you flying cargo to Alaska in February.”\n\n“Yes, sir.”\n\nWithout another word, Muffin marched to the front of the room.\n\nThe two stood frozen, until the commander was fully out of earshot.\n\nThe rookie whispered, barely audible, “I think I peed a little.”\n\nHellhound didn’t answer. He just slowly picked up his toothpick again, slid it between his teeth, and muttered,\n\n“Yeah. That’s Muffin.”",

His too-familiar reference to the F-16 grated on me a little, as this almost-man sitting next to me felt that graduating from the Air Force Academy gave him some special status in this room. \n\n\"That name is generally reserved for the people who have experienced it, but yeah. The F-16 is an incredible machine.\" I leaned back in my chair and made sure he saw the gold oak leaves on my shoulders. I've been doing this for over a decade, with the calluses on my backside to prove it, and this young officer's attitude rubbed me the wrong way for no rational reason. \n\n\"My apologies, sir, but I'm just trying to my feet under me. I may have graduated near the top of my class, but there's a huge difference between book knowledge and actual experience. Things like call signs. You are Dart, yes?\" he asked as he slightly leaned forward. I admit that his change in demeanor seemed genuine, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt. After all, I'm his training officer and he'll be in the back seat of a F-16D for the next 12 months. \n\n\"Yes, I am Dart. You'll get your own call sign soon enough, I'm sure,\" I replied. I hoped to drive the conversation away from my call sign, but my hopes were quickly dashed.\n\n\"But not one nearly as cool as yours, Major. You fly one of the world's best aircraft and you have one of the world's best call signs. A dart is precise, it is sharp, and it can be incredibly fast. How did you get it?\" he asked. \n\nI sighed as I recalled memories from many years ago when I was not much older than him. \n\n\"Situational awareness is paramount in any environment,\" I said. He nodded along as though it was basic knowledge. Which, of course, it was. \"A young First Lieutenant, celebrating his recent promotion and assignment to a fighter squadron, happened to drink a few too many glasses of Jack and Coke. This same young officer, unaware that two Colonels were in the middle of an important wager, stumbled in front of a dart board just after a dart was let loose.\" \n\nI turned so that he could see my left ear lobe and the scar that still haunts me to this day. \n\nI could see his failing attempt to stifle his reaction and he finally released braying laughter just as our Colonel came into the briefing room with us. He looked at the young officer, then slowly turned to me.\n\n\"I assume you explained how you became Dart?\" he asked as his lips tried to resist a smile. \n\nI love my job, but the people can sometimes be a challenge. Still, we'll be airborne within the hour and I'll show my trainee what a dart can really do.",

        "body": "The sun's just peeking over the horizon, burning orange through the thin haze of jet fuel and desert dust. Out on the tarmac, the squadron’s getting ready for morning flight ops. F-22s line the runway like sleeping dragons, sleek and deadly. I’m leaning against my bird...helmet in hand, shades on, coffee in the other...trying to enjoy 5 minutes of peace before the day starts.\n\nThen he shows up. \n\nThe new guy.\n\nYou can always tell. Shiny new flight suit, boots so clean they might still squeak. Probably thinks this place runs on discipline and honor, instead of sarcasm and overcooked meatloaf.\n\nHe marches up, salutes. Too stiff. “Captain! I just wanted to say it’s an honor, sir. You’re, uh… ‘Snuggles,’ right?”\n\nThere it is.\n\nI lower the coffee. Close my eyes. Count to three. Doesn’t help.\n\n“Yeah,” I say. “That’s what they call me.”\n\nHe blinks. “I didn’t mean to....uh...I wasn’t making fun, I just....everyone said there’s a story. Something legendary.”\n\nI give him a long look. Could lie. Could say it’s classified. Could threaten to shove him into the intake of a running F-35.\n\nBut the kid’s nervous, twitchy. I’ve seen that look in the mirror. First deployment's coming, and he’s still trying to prove he belongs.\n\nSo I sigh, tip my head toward the wing. “C’mere. But if you laugh, I file for a dogfight simulation and light you up so hard the tower’ll think you’re reentering the atmosphere. Got it?”\n\nHe gulped,\" Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"Alright,” I begin. “Three years ago. Combat patrol. Classified op. Real hush-hush. We're flying into contested airspace under comms silence. I'm on point, eyes up, weapons hot. Everything’s smooth until my on board display starts freaking out. Targeting system glitches. Full blackout.”\n\nHis eyes widen. He’s hooked.\n\n“So I radio it in, get told to turn back. But there’s no backup in range, and we’re sitting on a high value target. So I make the call: I stay in the air. Low altitude, visual navigation only. I tell my wingman to cover me and go in with binoculars taped to my damn helmet like a dollar-store cyborg.”\n\nHis mouth opens. “Wait, what?”\n\n“You heard me. Old-school recon. Manual marking. My own two eyes. And it works. We complete the objective. Clean. Precise. No losses. Command’s thrilled.”\n\nI pause, let that hang for a second. Then I continue.\n\n“Then we get to the debrief. Turns out my hot mic was on the entire time. Everything I said in the cockpit got piped into the recording.”\n\nHe tilts his head. “Like… what did you say?”\n\nI stare off again.\n\n“I may or may not have been talking to my plane. Coaching her through the flight. You know....‘Easy girl,’ ‘Stay with me,’ ‘Just a little more throttle, sweetheart, you’re doing great’... that kind of thing.”\n\nHe makes a strangled noise in his throat.\n\nI hold up a finger.\n\n“I also may have said, and I quote: ‘You’re my brave little jet muffin, now let’s show them what snuggles can do.’”\n\nHe bursts out laughing. Can’t hold it. Doubles over, wheezing.\n\nI shake my head. “And just like that, ‘Snuggles’ was born. Callsign forever. Etched into my helmet, my locker, the side of my jet. They even made me a patch.”\n\nI pull back my flight jacket to reveal a morale patch: a cartoon F-22 with rosy cheeks and a blanket wrapped around it.\n\nThe rookie's practically crying.\n\nI squint at him. “What’s your name, kid?”\n\n“Uh—Davis, sir.”\n\n“Well, Davis, welcome to the squadron. From now on, your callsign is Tissues. Because you clearly need them.”\n\nHe stares in horror. “You’re kidding.”\n\n“Nope.” I toss my empty coffee cup in the bin and slap the nose of my jet. “Bird’s warmed up, Tissues. Let’s see what kind of cuddle-power you bring to the sky.”\n\nAnd as we walk toward the cockpits, I swear I hear someone from the hangar yell:\n\n“Snuggles and Tissues airborne in five!”\n\nGod help me.",

The cave's top covered in a dark yellow, drooping down the sort of heat that stuck to my face in my own sweat. I ruffled the heat out of my shirt and stopped behind Kevin, him gesturing to stop. Two pathways, we'd each need to take one and split up.\n\n\"Take the left, Isaac. I'll take the right,\" he said.\n\nI nodded, adjusting my headlight and shining the darkness away which revealed more rock. The tunnels narrowed further. The cave vibrated and a dull rumbling chattered through the thick walls. My breath left me and all I could do was go faster. They shouldn't have been here. I shouldn't be here. My headlight's gaze expanded out across a wide room and poured over the corpses of all six missing miners.\n\nTheir bodies were strewn about the rocks like figure paintings; a man leaned against the rock with blue gemstone crawling out every orifice of his body, crawling down back into him. Two of them held each other but the crystal had turned them into one. One looked like he tried to crawl away, but his lower half was consumed by it. The other two were not human, but crystal.\n\n\"Jesus, what the hell...Kevin--they're in here!\" \n\n  \nWhen we pulled their bodies out of that cave that day I had a lot of explaining to do. I have dreams about what I saw that day. About them waking up unable to breathe and clawing at my face and strangling me. I always wake up, but I can't get that crystal out of my mind. Something about it was insidious. The lab never got back to me about it. Men in suits came by my door the other day and spoke with me. \n\nI grabbed hold of the comb and pulled it through my hair. A lock of it came out with the comb and revealed a shining blue luster embedded within my scalp. I dropped the comb. A pervasive darkness came to me in that moment. I realized all those dreams and the screams of pain were real, corrupting my mind. Taking hold of me. My hand picked up the phone, but I didn't know who to call.\n\nI sank to the bathroom floor and held myself.",

        "body": "My vision tunneled as the edges went black, everything felt so incredibly small. Looking back on it seems hilarious, I had tunnel vision in a tunnel. The pounding in my chest was unbearably slow, as was the bending of my legs. It took far too long to collapse to the ground, I felt my knees hit, but only as a jarring stop, the pain didn’t exist yet.\n\nMy eyes tunneled in on his, Marcell, I’d gotten him the job. “Be a miner, it’s great pay and they don’t shove you into dank little crevices anymore, we got the drones for that. Plus when you get lost I’ll split my bonus for finding you”. We’d laughed and his long puffed up hair had bounced. His mouth hung open, it was doing that in the cave too, a silent portal that laughter couldn’t seem to escape anymore.\n\nFinally time moved normally again, my heart was pounding, my eyes burned, my lungs heaved. I heaved a can of protein junk and a candy bar onto the floor. My shaky fingers pressed the radio on my chest, my eyes couldn’t leave those of my brother’s. I noticed, but couldn’t place it as important at the time, his eyes weren’t supposed to be blue.\n\n“Fisherman, hook 5, level 87 tunnel 13, I’ve got6 mics, DOA.”\n\nThe radio was silent for a moment before the voice came back clearly, the wonders of technological advancement.\n\n“Hook 5, Fisherman, any sign of how or why?”\n\nThe world snapped into focus and I shoved everything into the back of my brain. I wasn’t a brother right now, I was a part of the rescue team. Training forced me to my feet as I approached the corpses, surveying most them, but carefully avoiding one. Blood seeped through their clothes and pooled on the floor, but it was coagulated. In the center of each of their chests was a blue crystal the size of my fist. My panic rose again as the obvious realization that it couldn’t have gotten there by accident.\n\n“Fisherman, they’ve each got a blue crystal in their chest. I think we have a half dozen murders down here and not the normal hate kind. This shit is culty.”\n\nThe line burst as soon as I pulled my thumb away.\n\n“All hooks, Fisherman, REEL REEL REEl!”\n\nI turned to look at my brother again, his jaw locked in what could be a scream or a chuckle and I finally noticed the difference. One blue eye pivoted slowly to look through my soul. I tried to run, but I was fixed in place, my adrenaline pumping and heart flooding it throughout my body, but my legs unable to obey me.\n\nIce ran down my spine as millennia of evolutionary fear told me that this is why we avoided the dark. That this is why space is pitch black. The air was kicked from my lungs and my knees hit the ground again. Everything was cold, a small pressure pulled my attention to my chest and I looked down. A fist sized blue crystal sat perfectly in my sternum. \n\nI quickly started to lose sensation in my body, a burning heat rising in my chest. Something brought my down to the ground, laying my on my back. I felt the draw in my chest increase as the last image of my brother standing over me flickered past my eyes and I remembered the brief.\n\n“7 miners are lost, one went missing last week and we couldn’t find him. 6 more just went missing last night…”\n\nIt’s cold in here, but overall not terrible, I feel cramped. I don’t remember why, but i probably shouldn’t like it. Yet, why would I want to be somewhere else? My entire life was a bunch of bodies in a tunnel, fear and pain and cold. what a weird thing to want. I’m glad my brothers managed to get me out of there.\n\nSlowly I command the nerves of the flesh like a marionette, what a fun word, and join my brothers as we move towards where I’d come from. I’d hate for anyone to stay as scared as I was, so it only makes sense that we help them feel as comfortable and warm as I am.\n\n\n—\nBeen a hot minute since I’ve written so please critique away, I need to get back up to snuff.",

His eyes never left the area where the bodies were slumped together as he inspected the crystals from a distance. Mentally he was taking in the size, shape and clarity, making mental notes of each crystal and their source. Once satisfied with his observations he crossed the imaginary line he had created between himself and the miners. It as safe to proceed.\n\nThe crystals were warm to the touch. They seemed to pulse under his hand, akin to a heartbeat. Fry was lost in the pulses, so much so that he did not realize two others had entered the cavern to see him standing over the miners and the crystals jutting from their bodies. \n\n“Oh my god!” the shrill voice and hastened words snapped Fry back to the real world. He turned to see Liza walking over to him and the scene. “What happened to them?” \n\nFry shrugged and snapped the end of the crystal he was holding. \n\n“Catch” he tossed the crystals into Liza’s outstretched hands. \n\nThe reaction was instantaneous, the crystal flashed white, and Liza dropped to her knees, blood running down from mouth, eyes and nose, face frozen in pain. No sound except the small thud of Liza landing on her knees. \n\nThe crystal that was in Liza’s hand started to spread across her hands and arm like an infection, sprouting small crystals in its path. For the first time Fry turned his attention to the other person in the room, a taller, more muscular woman whose face was contorted in disgust. \n\n“Only 6? There were supposed to be 20.” She said, her voice as tough and gravely as the stone around them. \n\nFry shrugged, “What can we do Anya, we have 6…” He paused looking at Liza and her continuing transformation, “7 by tomorrow.”\n\n“We needed the entire town by tomorrow.” Anya snapped back, her anger clearly raising. \n\n“We still have a long night ahead of us. Let’s make a game of it. First to a hundred wins.” \n\nAnya rolled her eyes at the suggestion, which only made Fry smile even wider.\n\n“It’ll be fun. Plus,” he motioned over to the 6 miners, “our kids should see their parents having fun.”\n\nSilence for the briefest of moments followed by a relenting sigh from Anya, “You always get your way.”\n\n“Love you too sweety.” \n\nFry started snapping the crystals off the body of the miners and placing them into two separate bags, “Remember, first to 100.”\n\nAnya grabbed a now filled bag and nodded. As she readying to leave, she looked back at Liza's body that was slowly being consumed by the crystal. Disgust could be seen on her face, followed quickly by anger and then rage. It was at rage that her body reacted, and she punched Liza straight in the chest with such force that a dull thud echoed within the cavern. The crystals stopped spreading, they dropped harmlessly to the ground next to now fallen body of Liza, who after the punch had fallen backwards. \n\n\"I didn't want her to give birth to one of ours.\"\n\nFry could only nod, it was not his place to question his wife's decision on which human would bear their children. \n\n\"Of course, back to 6. Let's give them time to grow, and in the meantime, we'll see who gets to a hundred first.\"\n\nWicked smiles spread across their faces, and they backtracked, looking for the other members of the search party.",

        "body": "**An Endless Abyss of Cyan**\n\nIn my many years both as a cave diver and volunteer rescuer, I had never seen anything like this before. I had separated from my crew about half an hour ago, diverting into the older portion of the mines. Guided this time not by the collection of protocols and orders that descended down the shaft of the mine and into the core of the mountain, but by a deep intuition that yearned from within my gut. Basic protocol stated to start where the miners were most likely to be: in their work areas. The well lit portions of the mines, at least until a cave in. The veins offshooting the main mineshafts. Perhaps it was my experience as a cave diver, or perhaps something had called me from upon the void, but when I saw that thin sliver located in the unmarked threshold between the old abandoned portion of the mine and the newer site, a sliver just enough to fit a man through, I followed it.\n\nI bent and contorted myself through the crack. My feet inching forward, cocked at the unnatural pependular angles that only spelunkers like I had grown accustomed to. Becoming water, as the words of my old instructor echoed through me, loosening my limbs and slithering through. The gap had gone on further than I expected, the light of my headlamp which had illuminated the narrow gray faces of rock ahead of me seemed to be swallowed by the darkness the permeated the space between the rocks. But I kept moving forward. Unwilling to bail. So certain that the men we seeked laid at the far end of this narrow corridor, even if all conventional wisdom would point to no. Finally, after minutes of slithering, I had reached an opening, exhausted and fatigued from that long journey through the narrow gap.\n\nHere the darkness overcame my headlamp. Pressed upon it like the walls had just done to me. Sucked it away into an abyss. The beam that had been so bright and so reliable earlier in the expedition now a dim white light, no brighter than an incandescent at the end of its life. And I had replaced the batteries as per protocol before this mission. However, my dull beam was not the only source of light in this room.\n\nSix cyan stalagtites of varying sizes descended from the ceiling on the far side of the cavern. Fearing that my light would not turn back on, I covered the beam with my palm to make sure they were not reflecting my light. They did not, and continued to glow within the darkness of the room. My curiosity took over, leaving me astray from the mission once again, and I walked over to the collection. I was no geologist, but I was certain that no mineral produced its own lighting source. I at least had never seen anything like it in my time as a cave diver. Their dull blue glow reminded me of the bioluminescence of glowworms as they hung to the roofs of caves, dripping their lure of mucus to catch unsuspecting flying insects. Geoluminescence in this case, I suppose. I noticed a second formation on the floor, much smaller slivers of blue that rose out of the ground, or perhaps an optical illusion created by a pool of standing water beneath the glowing stalagtites overhead.\n\nCloser now, a few feet away, the beams of my headlamp now no more brighter than a nightlight. The blue light of the minerals brighter, or perhaps my eyes had just adapted quicker than I expected. Here at this proximity, just feet away, did I notice them pulse. The pulsing was not significant, and could be easily explained away as a trick of the eye, but I swore they pulsed. I even counted the slight fluctuations, about sixty beats per minute I assumed. The fatigue that had followed me out of the sliver now stronger, and warmer. I could feel my hamstrings and abs tightening, as if I had endured a long aderous workout and not a usual passage. The formation on the ground was indeed a formation. Six clusters of three small slivers extended upwards on from the floor. In turn, I noticed a seventh stalagtite, hidden behind the cluster of six, but with no cluster beneath it. At least not visible from this angle.\n\nWhen I reached the formation, my breath deep and panting, my legs sore and weak, my foot kicked against something.  I looked down. A hardhat. Not unlike the ones the miners who we had spoken earlier on the surface wore. Yellow and bearing the company’s insignia of a jagged spiral that was supposed to represent a drill. Perhaps my intuition had been right, perhaps I had found the miners. Using the dimness of my beams and the ambient lighting of the crystals over, I gazed forward. If I had any strength left I would have stepped back at the sight. But instead I stood there, frozen. Here I could see clearly the origins of the clusters. Faces. Faces attached to bodies laying flat on the floor, donning the beige jumpsuit of the mining company. Six faces with a small sliver of cyan stalagmites ascending from them. Two from the eye sockets, one from the mouth. Using my little strength, I walked with sore warm legs around the group, inspecting them. Making sure what I saw was real and not some sort of optical illusion. I kicked at one of their legs, it was indeed a leg, based on the way it wobbled back and forth. I thought I heard a gentle moan come from the mouth of the man I just kicked.\n\nI reached the far side of the group. My now muscles feeling as solid as rocks. My legs now heavy. My breath now deep. I decided to lay down. And so I did. I sat myself on the floor and let gravity pull my body flat towards it. Above me a stalagmite hung from the ceiling. When I closed my eyes the darkness of the cave disappeared, and the world became an endless abyss of cyan in all directions.\n\n---\n\nIf you enjoyed this feel free to check out other stories by me over at /r/QuadrantNine.

So while I can...         \n              \nPlease listen.        \n          \nVentilation shafts were clear. Access shafts clear. All mapped tunnels were empty. What I found wasn't part of the mine initially.               \n               \nI'd been following one of the emergency escape routes. These tended to be well lit with lamps propped up at regular intervals. When saw the first broken lamp, I called in on the radio and let the rest of the rescue operation know before heading in further into the dark.      \n          \nMore broken lamps littered the tunnel. Their lights had been put out, glass shattered and frames dented. It seemed deliberate.        Increasing the strength of my helmet light, I peered down the remaining length of the tunnel, only to be startled momentarily as I saw the freshly excavated passage diverging off the emergency tunnel. My light only revealed a yawning maw, black as pitch.            \n          \n*\"... I've located a passage. Looks recent, not on the maps.\"*              \n                  \n*\"...copy. Stay alert and proceed.\"*                  \n          \nAdjusting my mask, I cautiously made my way into this undisclosed tunnel. The emergency tunnel had been pitch black beyond the functioning lamps, but when I went through the gaping maw of the new passage, I felt the small hairs on the back of my neck rise. I was being *swallowed* into something far more substantial.     \n           \nIt was as if I was a child again, following my father into dimly lit tunnels, silently crying not to be left behind.    \n             \nI shook off the nerves and went down the unmarked tunnel. On reflection, that was the critical juncture. Long dormant instincts were crying out to me, that most primal part of the brain desperately firing off neurons to alert the larger, softer portions that had developed more recently. I was going somewhere that I shouldn't be. I was somewhere perilous, where my life would be in danger.      \n          \nBut my training kicked in, suppressing all those primitive warnings in favor of the rational, the logical.        \n         \n*\"I hear music.\"*              \n           \n*\"Say again, Rico.\"*            \n               \nI furrowed my brows. *\"... nothing. Audio... distortions.\"*     \n             \n*\".... .... ..... \"*        \n             \nI listened to the static, but no response was forthcoming.     \n          \nBut I could hear the chimes.       \n       \nI was practicing with the choir at church. It was a warm spring day.        \n               \n*Music reaches the Lord like a prayer.*      \n          \nI... think that was Sister Abigail who had said that.      \n       \nI wake up with a start. I'd fallen into some kind of stupor on my feet. \"*Rico here*\" I say groggily into the radio.      \n           \nThe voice on other end was faint, barely able to be parsed from the background noise.      \n        \nAnd those chimes.     \n         \n\"*Ric- ...-been try.. -to contact you for...l... two hour-...*\"       \n           \nI swallowed dryly, looking around, the narrow tunnel. One question stood stark in my mind. How far had I gone into this tunnel?       \n        \nThe chiming grew louder.      \n         \nI moved towards it.       \n        \nThe tunnel opened up into a cavern and I saw them. The miners. All six of them. Their bodies were arranged together in a sort of latticework, connected by crystalline structures that had pierced through their flesh.         \n       \nI trembled as their heads moved listlessly in my direction, their eyes unseeing. From their open mouths came an unearthly chiming, no doubt its source the crystalline structures running through them.       \n            \nThe dead sang to me, and I could feel something growing deep within. No, I realized. It had been growing since I first heard those damned chimes.                \n              \n\"*Don't come!*\" I screamed into the radio. \"*Pathogenic infection! COLLAPSE THE MINE! COLLAPSE THE MINE!*\"          \n               \nMy next memory is of waking up and feeling the crystal that had grown through my left eye. I drove the tip into the groin of a dead miner and slowly, painfully, joined the latticework.       \n           \nI joined in the song, calling out to something.      \n          \nSomething that lived even deeper, sleeping, waiting.        \n              \nSometimes I am in the church, listening to the choir. Sometimes I am frantically running down a black passage that goes deeper and deeper into the earth.          \n              \nThe earth is not ours. It is not ours to plunder, it is not ours to claim. There were others before, long, long before - but they are not dead.     \n        \nThey are *listening*.       \n          \nStay up there on that happy surface, where your voices can't reach. I beg you.      \n         \nHere in the belly of the earth, in the endless night, let me sing with my choir forever.",

For good measure, I pulled my emergency stick of dynamite, lit it, tossed it near the bodies, and walked away.\n\nScrew that.  I’ve got to get the rest of the team out of here.\n\nAfter the explosion collapsed that tunnel, I held up the walkie talkie, and said, “Call off the search, team.  We’re not bringing them back.  All KIA.”\n\n“What do you mean ‘KIA?’” my boss asked.\n\n“I mean ‘they’re all dead or may as well be, they have unleashed either some magic or touched something they shouldn’t have, and I’m not paid enough to investigate what killed them, let alone attempt to recover their corpses.’  And if you’re smart, you saw my body camera footage, so you know they’re crystal people, now.  So yeah, screw that.”\n\n“You do realize that the plot of the story hinges on you investigating, right?”\n\n“I know,” I said, still making my way out of the mine shaft.  “But I’m the only black person here.  I know where this is about to go, so I’m getting out while I can.  You can fire me all you like, but there is no way I’m about to be the first casualty in the actual horror parts.”\n \n I made my way onto the elevator as the boss complained, “I knew we should have refused your request for explosives and guns.  Now we don’t have a survival horror game.”\n\nI didn’t care as the end credits began to scroll past my vision, thus preventing some snot nosed kid who probably convinced their annoyed parents to buy the game world I existed in from having their fun dealing with undead horrors.  I’m going to live the rest of my simulated life in peace unless they find someone else with room temperature IQ to be dumb enough to dig past where I collapsed the tunnel.\n\nI’m not dying down there, and I’ll find another job.

        "body": "A few months ago, I raided the kingdom of Vranckx, going straight to the Royal Palace and kidnapped their admittedly very fair princess. I was expecting it to be a regular thing, get the girl, have them send someone, defeated, ask for ransom to spare the adventurers' lives, and make my hoard a little larger. That was the plan, however, it stopped at the \"they send someone\" part. It's been half a year and no one has ever come to my lair to try and rescue her from my grasp.\n\nIn the meantime, her and I got to know each other better, and even started to get friendly with each other. I could see she's a very nice and polite woman, and a good conversationalist to boot. Long nights of talking had grown more frequent, a huge difference from the start when she spoke the bare minimum out of me being her kidnapper. Fair point honestly. However, last week something happened that broke her.\n\nA messenger accidentally fell into my lair, on his way to deliver messages to her kingdom. I let him go on the condition he asks for ransom from the King, her father, then maybe do what I was supposed to in the first place. Three days later the messenger came back... With terrible news. She was nothing but a bargaining chip to avoid conflict with a smaller kingdom, which they ended up conquering not long after I took her. She wasn't truly loved, and her older sister who never liked her was chosen to be the heir. Manipulation? Probably. Heartbreak? Well, my princess's tears said it all. I let the messenger go again, no conditions this time.\n\nI wrapped myself around her to try and console her, I thought about taking her back to her kingdom but it wouldn't be a good look for me, and I don't think she'd be happy knowing the truth. I then offered her the chance to become a dragon like myself to get back at those who wronged her. \"N-no...\" She said, her voice breaking. \"I-I don't want to go b-back now...\" I let her cry on my tail, having grown fond of her during her stay I cared for her... More than her own blood it seems.\n\nShe cried herself to sleep that night, with me following suit not long after, some resentment growing in me. How could they do that to such a sweet girl? The next morning I was still around her, shielding her from any cold she could have felt. She had been awake for a while, and with some newfound resolve in her eyes. \"Falun...\" She said once she saw I was awake. \"I want to be a dragon.\" Seldom was she so direct, and when she was it meant she was fully convinced. \"I don't want to go back home... I want to stay here with you. You always treated me well and I can see you actually care for me.\" My eyes grow wide, she actually wants to *stay*?\n\nI ask her if she's sure, three times, phrased slightly different every time. All three times she stands by her choice. Very well. I get up and away from her a little, then shower her with fire. Normally it would burn her to a crisp, but the only thing that went were her clothes. She started growing larger and larger, scales replacing skin, horns and wings sprouting from her body. It was a bit slow but not very painful, and she ended up being only slightly smaller than myself. The first thing she did? Lock necks with me, her own way to show affection as a dragon.\n\nShe has never left my side since. Always wanting to do what I do, and me gladly letting her. She's getting the hang of flying, though I still go hunting on my own for a while as she's not quite as good yet. Soon she'll be joining in, and maybe even going by herself if she's confident enough. Whatever happens, I found something more valuable than gold. I went looking for a slightly bigger hoard, but found my most precious treasure. Never would I have imagined I'd find my mate, but I regret nothing.",

        "body": "It was an unseasonally cold night when Larimer first spoke to the other geriatric patrons of the Emerald Eyes and Clever Guise. The pub was the haven for a close knit village, offering a neutral meeting ground, and for the seasonally cold months, Larimer was an odd reticent guest. It was only on this oddly cold summer night that he told the village his past.\n\nThe conversation was somewhat unassuming -- some sort of usual parental pride posturing about pediatric prowess. \"If I told you why I was proud of the one person I could call my daughter, you would try to hang me.\" Something in his tone told his listeners that they wouldn't succeed at the hanging. After a silent agreement that such an attempt would not be made, Larimer ordered an ale and continued: \"I was once the great Landstrador over West: Tossan the traumatic.\"\n\nThe ale came. \"You'll know that Tossan disappeared some ten years ago. I hid from my own creation, Himedra.\" Larimer sipped the ale. \"Of course, she was not always Himedra. At first she was Ayame Tokawa, the princess in the East, who was tragically kidnapped by the traumatic Landstrador.\"\n\nAs he took another sip, he stared into the flagon, as if it was a portal into the past. \"At first, all I could think was about how pathetic she was. Feeble. Weak. She seemed to just cry. I let her be, thinking of the gold I would get in ransom.\" He put the flagon down. \"But weeks turned into months and I started wondering if anybody was coming for her. She insisted that I eat her, or something silly like that, but I kept to my monetary desires, like a good dragon.\" He smiled, thinking if one could really be a dragon in past tense only. \"But after another month, I couldn't bear it. I told her that there was a fate more tantalizing than consumption, but more traumatic, and more terrible. I offered her the chance to become a dragon.\"\n\n\"The Himedra?\" A murmur came from the audience. Larimer just smiled before reheating the man's hot mead with his breath. \"Yes,\" he continued, \"I taught the Himedra, but she took it all further. 'Traumatic' required somebody to be traumatized, but 'heinous' needed no living witnesses. At first, of course, she cried about the offer, saying things like 'I guess I'm that much of a failure of a human' or 'I'll even be a worthless dragon.' But she very grudgingly accepted in a few days. 'May be it's better than just being a captive, it's not like I'll be worth anything to my kingdom.'\"\n\nAfter Larimer sipped more ale, he added: \"and, at first, she was still weak. Pathetic. She learned to fire breathe in a reasonable amount of time, and eventually learned about how tough her scales were, but she wasn't destructive, and she'd cry for days after any sort of outing. I started to think that I should've just killed her.\"\n\nLarimer hesitated. Nobody was doubting his story, and by now, they understood both why they would want to hang him and why they couldn't. \"But then came the day I learned how wrong I was about her. A day I'll never forget.\"\n\n\"I thought she was pathetic. I was used to her crying all the time. Even if she was doing anything, she was doing it meekly. But this one morning, even the way she walked was different. She looked me in the eye, with a glare of some sort. But I realized that she was just looking at trash. I was dead to her. 'Genius likes an audience. Or, I should say, narcissism does, but that's not really the point,' she told me. That was crazy to hear. And her voice. She actually sounded like she could be an empress. 'To clarify, everything you saw since the time I was kidnapped was an act. At first, to garner your pity, but after you made me a dragon, it was to just buy myself time.'\"\n\n\"I asked her what that time was for and she just challenged me to a duel. That was the fall of the traumatic Landstrador. The era of the Heinous one had begun. She defeated me quickly, deftly doing everything I taught her and more. After she pinned me down, she simply said \\`it's not worth killing you, and I think you'd rather live, so let's make a trade. I'll just leave and you'll just live.\\` Of course, let her leave, but I looked at the destruction that she left behind, and saw that it was so much worse than what I did. She simply erased towns from history.\"\n\nAfter a long silence, Larimer added: \"She told me that she only ever wanted to be free but also important.\"",

        "body": "I was becoming concerned about the princess.\n\nIn theory, I disapproved of the whole \"kidnap the princess\" gig. For a monarch to go to all the trouble of hiring a *fire-breathing dragon* to descend from the sky in a cloud of brimstone and physically purloin a princess of the blood--and possibly eat an unspecified number of men-at-arms in the process--solely to create the opportunity for some pedigreed young ruffian to don a tin can, gallop about on a white horse looking heroic while swinging a badly-balanced sword, and \"win her heart\" in an obviously staged rescue...well, frankly, to me it always seemed like a ridiculously elaborate way to avoid talking to one's daughter. But even a dragon occasionally becomes low on funds, so I had reluctantly accepted the King's offer of generous compensation.\n\nI had made the usual dramatic entrance: roars, smoke, lashing tail, thunderous wings of airborne doom, etc. I had virtuously limited myself to eating only a single man-at-arms and merely scattered the rest with a well-timed gout of sulfurous flame. I had neatly snatched the princess from the back of her rearing palfrey in a confusion of fainting ladies-in-waiting and shrieking serving maids. I had flapped triumphantly away over the horizon with her to a chorus of the dazed court's terrified screams. I had tucked her away in my cavern of vaulted stone with a whispered apology and a strong cup of tea (because after all I'm not a *monster)* and then composed myself to wait for the rescue.\n\nThat was months ago.\n\nThe princess had settled in as well as could be expected. She spent her mornings bustling about the cave, dusting and tidying with a brave little song on her lips, before joining me at noon for a light lunch. She embroidered in the afternoons, or walked about the meadow just outside the cave, or tried making cheery conversation that became gradually more and more strained as the days wore on. \n\nFor the last week, though, I hadn't heard a note of her courageous little song. Dust bunnies and the occasional shed scale were beginning to drift in the corners of the cavern. Conversation had long come to a halt. The princess was, understandably, growing rather irritable and decidedly glum. \n\nI tiptoed anxiously about the cavern until finally, very late one sunny morning, I found her still abed, her tousled golden head buried under the covers, quietly crying her eyes out.\n\nThis was really too much. I would have sat down companionably upon the mattress next to her, except of course I was decidedly too large, so I contented myself with curling my scaly tail around the bedframe in what I hoped was a comforting manner and asking her, in a solicitous tone, if she'd like to talk about it.\n\nShe flung back the covers dramatically and gazed up at me with a tragic expression. \"I don't think anyone's COMING,\" she wept.\n\nI didn't either, to be quite honest, but that hardly seemed a helpful thing to say. \"Erm...perhaps the prince is just...a bit late? Maybe he had to have his destrier reshod? Or...his armor polished? Or perhaps he needed a new sword forged. That sort of thing takes time, you know.\"\n\n\"Three *months* would have been long enough to do all that, and train a new squire besides,\" she replied with a dainty scowl. \"The fact is, he's *chickened out* and you know it as well as I do.\"\n\nI hemmed and hawed for a moment, but there didn't seem to be any denying it. \n\n\"Would you like to send a message to your father the King? It would be a little anticlimactic, but I could fly you back to the castle.\"\n\n\"No, certainly NOT,\" she said, the scowl on her face deepening well past daintiness. \"If he was willing to go to such lengths to get rid of me in the first place, I don't want to go back. I don't suppose he's sent anyone to ask after me at all?\"\n\nEmbarrassed, I was forced to admit that indeed there had not been a word from the King in all this time. \n\n\"Oh, I could just scream!\" exclaimed the princess, and thrust her face despondently back into the pillow.\n\nI patted her shoulder awkwardly with the tip of one comically large claw. \"There, there.\"\n\nThe princess gave a small sob, a quiet hiccup, and then punched the pillow viciously with one delicate but not at all gentle little fist. \"I wish *I* were a dragon,\" she said, her voice muffled. \"I'd give that cowardly prince the fright of his life. And I'd burn the roof off Father's castle. And then I'd do as Iiked, instead of always what I'm told. I'd quite like to stay right here, except I'm so dreadfully embarrassed to just be forgotten like this. Sometimes I simply *loathe* being a pretty...polite... helpless...little...PRINCESS.\"\n\nDragons don't have ears, or mine would have pricked right up upon hearing this. It did seem terribly unfair, her getting pawned off and carried away and stuck in a cave and then not even rescued afterwards. And...it was hardly the done thing, but I had to admit I'd grown quite fond of her. She had really been very good company, all things considered. What fun we could have together, if only she were a dragon as well! \n\n\"Do you mean that?\" I asked, doubt and hope mingling in my tone. \n\n\"Don't I!\" she cried. \"That would be glorious. Say...is it awfully fun to fly?\"\n\n\"Oh, *extremely,\"* I assured her. \n\nShe gave another wistful sigh. \n\nI hesitated another moment and then made my decision. Damn the rules. \"Er...ahem,\" I said with an anxious little cough. \"If you really were serious...if you truly wanted to be a dragon, I mean...I ought to tell you, there's a fairy godmother in the next kingdom over who owes me a favor. It could...possibly...be arranged.\"\n\nNext moment I had surprised us both by *blushing* all over my scaly green long-snouted face as she threw both her arms around my neck with a shout of delight.",

It was approaching two years since she was taken; the dragon attacking a royal caravan that encroached in its domain, trying to get through the mountains before the passes snowed shut. The guards were prepared for banditry, possibly ambush from enemy forces but the feared dragon of the Angry Pinnacle was able to rout them and take what it could and set to flame the rest. The carriage was easy to haul, and its prize was gold, riches, silks and... *her*. Princess Amilie of the Kingdom of Brandtstaad; on her way to marry Duke Reinard of the Tserian Empire. An envoy was sent to both realms, a demand for ransom, not onerous but in line with the way a dragon operates, the pure covetousness of their existence, but nothing came. She was kept fed and healthy, as fulfilled as possible for an area that escape was unfeasible but now anger seated where hope once lived. She knew it would not let her go, not without payment and there was nothing she had here that it did not claim dominion over and out beyond there wasn't access. \"What should I do with you?\" It asks as the Princess spits, staring defiantly and the Dragon laughs. \"Maybe I should give you a gift, though you may come to consider it a curse, I know those who have.\" It settles down, staring at her with eyes more used to appraisal than even the fleeting attempt at empathy provided. \"It is said, young one, that the path to True Royalty is to cut, to carve with the terrifying Blade of Want that harms both ally and enemy alike and use that to impose your will.\" It laughs as it continues, \"It's the simplest thing to achieve and the most difficult, but even failure can bring power if you are committed.\" It smiles, not joyful or happy but the smile of one about to divulge some knowledge that should remain hidden. \"To carve oneself away, to let in the one piece and build hard around it, the self formed to a single concept, *that* is a Dragon, and I offer you a place as my apprentice to learn, and eventually overcome me, and those that left you here.\"",

        "body": "I'm not usually one to wallow in self-pity, but at some point a dragon has to face the facts.\n\nHello, my name is Spinel, and I can't do anything right.\n\nI've learned over the course of my life that a lack of ability can often be bridged by a wealth of perseverance. When at a young age my own flame turned out too weak to light a campfire, I decided fire magic was the way to go. If human wizards could chuck fireballs, why couldn't I? My parents' hoard contained many tomes and scrolls no dragon knew how to read. They were only too happy to be rid of them.\n\nTruly, learning magic was the best decision I'd made, unfortunately it didn't earn me the respect of my older brothers. \"Spineless Spinel\" is how they refer to me. Hilarious, I know. I can almost hear them even now: \"Couldn't bring down a castle to save his life, and couldn't burn down a village if the villagers provided him with matchsticks.\"\n\nIt's true that I couldn't match them in strength or ferocity. So I resolved to show them up without resorting to either. For weeks I studied scrying spells to spy on the human king's guards. I scouted the itinerary the royal carriage would be following ahead of time. I hid myself in an opening on the face of a cliff near one of their scheduled stops. And when the moment came, I used magic to raise a dense fog and swooped in. Before any of the guards could realise what had happened, I had made away with my prize.\n\nMy prize, who is currently sobbing inconsolably next to me in my lair, where she's been living for the last eight months. How did things go so wrong? I did everything in order, I think.\n\nThe letter of ransom was in good form, and I made sure it got into the hands of that royal messenger. I even sent a reminder!\n\nOkay, I sent _a lot_ of reminders. I might have ended up looking desperate. In my defense, the poor girl's mood was spiraling and even a dragon could only wait so long without starting to get anxious.\n\nAnd then, on this cool autumn morning, the reply finally came. The young messenger had been shaking like a leaf, his eyes as big as saucers as he held out the scroll for me to take without saying a word. No sooner was it out of his hand that he ran off like the devil, tripping on a rock and just narrowly avoiding falling flat on his face. Frankly that had been a bit rude.\n\nThe missive explained—in words much more scathing than what I would have expected from royalty—that following my kidnapping of Princess Helena, fourteenth in line to the throne of Rocheclaire, a hard-won marriage arrangement with some lordling from the southern marshes had fallen through. Bandits had apparently thrown the unfortunate man out of his manor and taken over most of his lands in the span of the last few months. As it was, Helena was so far down the line of succession and already beyond the age where a young princess was expected to marry. As such, the king had decided that she was worth neither a dragon's ransom, nor the price it took to send knights to my doorstep to get her back by force. So they would be delighted if the noble dragon would kindly refrain from sending any more ransom letters, please and thank you.\n\nThey were washing their hands of her! A young girl, the king and queen's own daughter, and they were washing their hands of her! I had believed dragon families to be cruel. It turns out I had underestimated the ignominy of men. Left behind for the crime of being last and least desirable of the clutch, now wasn't that a familiar feeling.\n\nSo here I am, three tons of muscle and scaly hide, trying to dry the tears of this small human girl. So much for proving I could be dragon-like for once. I had covered Sweet Helena with a wing to shield her from the evils of this world as best I could as I listened to her woes.",

Why?\" she asked.  \n\"A dragon was sighted when the Northern Barbarians are threatening with invasion, the Southern shamanic tribes are due to a new wave of attack to kidnap more of us.  \nA new Church appeared, spreading their faith that is directly against ours.  \nSo, when a dragon, a being that can shake a kingdom appeared...I was sent to dispatch it before it makes the waters even muddier.  \nBut...considering you are a shapeshifting one, I can not kill you.\" I said.  \n\"Then? What will you do?\" she asked.  \n\"Report back, and ask for orders.  \nAnd until then...may I ask of your hospitality? I see that this workshop has at least 3 rooms.\" I smiled.  \nShe froze, blushed, and then sighed.  \n\"Sure...but do put in a good word. Also, dare to peek on me when I bathe, and I will have your head!\" she said, storming away.  \nI was confused.  \nWhy would I peek on...Oh...Goddess above, what is in her draconic mind?",

        "body": "\"I hope their ale is better than the last town.\"\n\nZayd pinched the bridge of his nose, letting out a sigh that would have taken all the strength of a lesser man to summon. \"We are not here to sample the ale, Mundir,\" he said. \"We are here to free the kindly folk from the yoke of a great evil.\" Mundir scratched himself in a way unbefitting one of his prestigious station. \"Well this 'great evil' better have a decent horde at least. I've seen beggars with more coin than that last wyrmling we slaughtered.\" Zayd chafed. It had been a long week of travel, and he would have been in a much worse mood if not for the bright sun overhead and the lush green grasses shining between sparse copses of trees on the hills surrounding the small valley town. \"We do not do our duty for coin, my dear Squire. You would do well to remember that.\"\n\n\"Coin tends to have more economic versatility than gratitude, Sir Knight.\" Mundir stopped to bow formally for the statement. Zayd found himself delighted by the sudden decorum. Surely his squire had at last found his decency, and was not being obviously sarcastic. \"Yes,\" Zayd replied. \"I remember the... *incident* in the last settlement,\" he paused. \"Vividly.\" Mundir cringed. \"In my defense,\" he started, holding up a finger. \"You spoke so highly of the *value of honor*, I had assumed my night in the brothel would be free.\" Zayd was decidedly *not* in the mood to relitigate this issue. Certainly not as they entered the town, and people began to gather to lay their eyes on the newcomers. He had a reputation to uphold, after all.\n\n\"Good people of the valley!\" Zayd shouted, entirely too loudly for the small group gathered. \"I and my associate have come to rid you of the terrible evil plaguing these lands.\" The people gathered did not respond immediately. Indeed, they exchanged what appeared to be confused glances with one another. Further clarification was clearly required. \"Word has spread far and wide of a great dragon in this region.\" Zayd drew his sword and held it high, pointing it to the heavens. \"You need only point me to its lair, and I shall dispatch the fowl wyrm!\" Zayd felt the power of his God course through his veins. His mighty sword shone in the sunlight, a holy radiance to cut through the darkness of the world. He remained in that position as the townsfolk tried on bemused expressions. Mundir cleared his throat. \"They do not appear receptive to this approach, Master Paladin\" he said. Then he walked away.\n\nWith Zayd continuing to pose as the people gradually dispersed.\n\nZayd found Mundir in the tavern. Of course. Mundir had managed to get remarkably drunk in the short amount of time he had been separated from his master. The town, apparently, had a distillery and that meant strong spirits for Mundir to further befuddle his already feeble mind. \"I liiiike this town,\" Mundir said. \"The drinks are gooood. Food isn't great, though.\" Zayd frowned as he observed the growling dog that his squire had evidently tried to take a bite of. \"Never seen a stew that bites back before,\" he said before launching into a fit of uncontrollable laughter. \"Sir!\" Zayd said, pulling the man to his feet. \"We have a reputation to uphold!\" Mundir took several moments to focus his eyes. Zayd sighed, laid his hands on the man and cured him of all poisons. Mundirs eyes went wide, and he bolted through the door to vomit in the street. He walked back in, wiping his mouth on his sleeve.\n\n\"I hate when you do that,\" he said. \"Reputation aside, I was doing my job, Sir. There's a dragon here alright. Wyrm stink all over this town, and the people? Not one of them knows a thing about it.\" Zayd was taken aback. \"A shapeshifter?\" he said. \"Among them? A powerful dragon, then. Fully grown.\" Mundir shied away from the angry dog, puzzled at why it did not like him. \"It would seem so. Still...\" he said, moving in closer and continuing at a hushed tone. \"Shouldn't be too hard to root it out. The beasts are too curious to not investigate hunters in their midst personally. Before too long, our quarry will come to us.\" He reached out to grab his cup, and Zayd put his hand over the top, earning a groan from his squire. \"A room for the night, barkeep. Two beds, if possible.\" He tossed a gold coin on the counter, which landed almost as hard as Mundirs jaw when it hit the floor. It was a hundred times the cost, at least, but these were good people, and Zayd was sure they could use the coin.\n\n\"At once, Sir Knight!\" the barkeep said, the gold seeming to reflect and gleam in his eyes. He rushed away, shouting to his barmaid to prepare the best (and presumably only) room. Before long, the pair were enjoying a delightful spiced stew next to the hearth. Mundir ate cautiously, unable to place why he thought the stew might bite him. Zayd admired the people in their revelry. They drank their spirits, sang, danced. Good people, yes indeed. So kind of them to donate to the plate at the front of the bar. Overflowing as it was with coin of lesser denominations. A bit odd, as those were normally reserved for temples, but Zayd thought nothing of it. He found himself so lost in the good cheer that Zayd nearly forgot the next step of his process. A quick spell to dispel illusions, as a precaution before spending the night in a new place. The flash of light that issued from his hands was brighter than expected and, when it subsided, he found the townspeople looking distinctly more reptilian than they had moments prior. \"Kobolds!\" Mundir said, drawing his sword.\n\n\"Ah,\" the barkeep said in draconic, flammable saliva dripping from a maw full of razor sharp teeth. \"Shit.\"",

        "body": "“A dragon. Big, ugly thing with scales. And, it flies too. You’ve really never heard of a dragon before? Not even in a story?” Harold rested his hands on his hips, the silk cloth covering his chest fluttering with the warm evening breeze, making the symbol of his church’s hollow cup stand out.  \n\n \n\nHarold, like every believer of the Ginoriaz church, always wore the symbol of a hollow cup on his body. The cup being a reminder that before they can drink from the cup of their goddess, they must fill the cups of others. They could do this by performing good deeds like feeding the poor, or converting souls to the Ginoriaz religion. Harold, not being much of a diplomat or cook, went the mercenary route. Taking care of dangerous jobs for people who couldn’t afford hired help. That had led him on a goose chase to find the dragon of Norva, a creature that had eluded him for the last five months.\n\n \n\n“A flying scaley creature? Hm, I’ve heard of a flying purple people eater, but not a Dragging on.” The old man pondered, scratching the one frustrating long white hair on his pointed chin. That hair always catching Harold’s attention, whether he wanted it to or not.\n\n \n\n“A dragon.” Harold patiently corrected. “A flying purple people eater doesn’t exist. That I am certain of,” Harold said, trying to steer the conversation back on track.\n\n \n\n“How can you be so sure?” Popa asked, giving a grin that showed off his three teeth, which all sat in strange spots. One in the middle, and one on the left and right of his mouth, giving him a bizarre smile. One that looked incomplete.\n\n \n\n“Because no one's reported seeing a flying purple people eater before.” He huffed, rubbing his forehead. Unlike the other members of his church, Harold didn’t have the patience of a saint, which made these jobs more challenging for him. He had been a guard before he converted, and not a very noble one at that. He exhaled, wanting to prove he had changed, because in his heart, he had truly tried to be better, even if people like Popa tested him.\n\n \n\n“Ok, I’ve seen a flying purple people eater. Does that make it real?”\n\n \n\n“You’ve what?”\n\n \n\n“I’ve seen one.”\n\n \n\n“No, you haven’t,” Harold snapped, his sharp tone causing the old man to wobble back. “I… Sorry, please don’t joke about that. Dragons aren’t a joking matter, and it’s been a very long few months.”\n\n \n\nPopa stepped forward, patting the man on his shoulder with the warmth of a cup of scalding of hot coffee. The tender action feeling as if it would burn through his clothes. “I’m only saying you can’t be certain these stories are even real.”\n\n“I… you may be right. People go crazy when it comes to monsters. Once one person mentions seeing something, all the townspeople join in. I believe the nurses have a word for it. Panic? Madness? Oh, I can’t remember the exact term they use, but they have one. Still, what about all those dead sheep and destroyed farmlands? Someone had to have attacked them.”\n \n“Maybe I ate them all? I love some good sheep in my belly.” The old man patted his stomach, revealing a hint of wrinkly flesh underneath the scrappy white top he wore. The hairy stomach having a slight curve to it, clearly decently fed.\n \nHarold gave a polite laugh, humoring the old man. “Yes, the great dragon stands before me with his three mighty teeth.”\n \n“Four teeth,” Popa corrected, smiling, showing off his four teeth. Harold’s head rocked, as if someone had struck him with a mace. He leant forward, counting them. One, two, three and-\n \n“Ugh.” The rotten breath of the man forced Harold to pull away, smelling a mix of raw fish and a scent he didn’t even wish to find a comparison for. “Four.” He said, when the scent had left his nostrils. “I’m losing it.”\n \n“You may need a rest. How long have you been at this little dragon hunt for?” The man asked.\n \nWith a long sigh, Harold rubbed his eyes, flicking off bits of sleep from his eyelids. “Too long. Much too long. Does this town have an inn? I think I should retire for the night before you grow a second head.” He laughed, though it was a half-hearted laugh, since a small part of him feared that may happen. Worried, he would soon find out the word the nurses used for madness, as he would become afflicted by it.\n \n“It’s called The lovely little lamb. It’s down the street, next to the pumpkin patch.” He explained, and Harold gave the man a respectful nod before walking to the inn. As he walked off, Bella, the daughter of the mayor, rushed over, holding a book to her chest.\n \n“Old man, Popa. Did that man ask you about the dragon, too?” She said, bouncing from foot to foot, overwhelmed by the excitement of having such an investigation take place in her father’s sleepy town.\n \n“Oh, yes. He was a nice enough fellow, even if he had some oddness to him.” He said, before pointing to the book she held. “What’s that dear? Another one of your silly monster stories? Don’t they give you nightmares?” He joked.\n\n“I’m nine now! I don’t get nightmares, cause I’m a big girl.” She beamed, holding the book up to Popa. “The dragon and the knight: A fight by the crimson moon.” She read the title before pointing at the picture on the cover. The picture depicting a dragon flying towards a heavily armored knight, who had his red blade held towards the sky, ready to pierce it on contact. “Isn’t it amazing?”\n \n“That’s a dragon?” Popa mused. “But doesn’t that make me?”\n \n“Yep, a dragon. Imagine if there really is one nearby. How amazing would that be?” she said, before stopping her bouncing. “Wouldn’t that make you what, old man, Popa?”\n \nPopa paused, reflecting on the image, before snickering. “As old as a dragon. Look at that skin. It must be as tough as mine.”\n \n“Nonsense. You’re older than any dragon.” She said, with a childish sincerity that was certain to hurt someone’s feelings. She skipped away after that comment, leaving Popa to contemplate his entire existence.\n \n“That’s what a dragon is? I didn’t know I was a dragon…. I sound scary.” He said, now aware that he was the horrifying creature the people spoke of. To him, everything he did felt so innocent. Swooping onto a farm to get a quick snack, accidentally burning the ground with his hot skin. Those were all innocent day-to-day activities for him. He wasn’t actively trying to be a monster. It happened naturally.\n \n“I’ll have to be more careful.” He said, shuffling back to his home, needing some time alone to think about his discovery.\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n(If you enjoyed this feel free to check out my subreddit /r/Sadnesslaughs where I'll be posting more of my writing.)",

        "body": "Paladin Reginald didn’t announce why he arrived at the village, but after the third night the rumors began to spread.  He had too many questions about strange goings on in the village, a focus on anyone new or strange, that alarm began to grow.  Old wives began to wonder, to anyone who would listen of course.  Was there a demon infestation in the town.  No, it must be cultists, remember that strange deer found dead in the sheep pasture, a sacrifice perhaps?  Or maybe he was hunting changelings, Maria’s daughter wasn’t crying as much as she used to, and seemed to just stare at everyone.  Mertle swore she saw a ring of mushrooms in the grove to the east, and fey were quite mischievous.\n\nReginald of course wasn’t here for any of those things.  He had heard rumors of dragons in the area, and giant flying beasts were something a village wouldn’t easily miss.  And after a fruitless week he decided to come clean to his hosts, a father and daughter who were recent additions to the village and his first suspects.\n\nThey were different in appearance to most of the isolated village, darker skinned and with a stronger build than most of the villagers.  They also had a peculiar manner of speech.  The father, Oren, was older but still with firm features and hair as dark as night, seeming to fend off any encroaching grey.  The daughter, Sage, was about Reginald’s age and had sharp brown eyes that seemed to pierce the soul.  She was striking figure, and the paladin, while chaste, could still find himself admiring her from across the room.  \n  \nPerhaps it was his own prejudices and distrust of outsiders, or the villagers all pointing to them as the newcomers, that led him initially to their door.  But they had been welcoming hosts, sharing their food and conversation.  Today would be no different.  \n  \n“Oh, those dragons.” Oren barked out a laugh, serving eggs and bacon to the paladin.  “They fled over a year ago.”  \n“What do you mean?” Reginald replied.  “I was ordered to come here and slay them.  I would have heard if the deed had already been done.”  \n“Would you?” Sage asked, sitting across from him.  “You came from the capital, yes?”  At his nod she continued.  “That is a long travel from here, and we do not get many couriers.  In winter I do not believe we get any at all, because of the snowfall blocking the mountain pass.  Though perhaps this year was different.”  \n“Because this is the first winter you stayed, if I recall.”  She nods.  “Yes.  That same issue is what made us stay in this village, and we found it delightful enough to remain, did we not, father?”  \nThe man sat down between the pair and started eating from his own plate.  “They appreciate hard working folk, and it was as good a spot as any to retire.  Pray to your god or gods that I have many good years ahead of me yet, but traveling took a lot out of me and more coin than I could afford to keep risking.”  \n“I will.” The paladin smiled with sincerity.  “So then tell me, how was the dragon vanquished?”    \n“Dragons.” Sage smiled delightfully.  “A father and daughter.  We do not know the full story, but adventurers had been trying and failing to raid their lair for a while, and the villagers decided to take matters into their own hands.”  \n“Villagers can’t fight dragons!” The paladin huffed, though there was something about the story that seemed to gnaw away at him.  \n“Oh they did not fight.  Dead, diseased carcasses, loud noise makers, have you ever had a bad neighbor, Paladin Reginald?”  \n“Reginald, please.” He replied exasperatedly.  “But yes, one of the squires in my order was into strange music and liked everyone to know it late at night.”  “So yes!  That.  They decided to be such unpleasant neighbors that the dragons left.”\n\n\\--",

He did not bother to look up as he sharpened his greatsword. A bronze shield shone by his side in the firelight.\n\n“I don’t understand the question.”\n\n“They’re *opposites*. How can you serve two masters who want different things?”\n\n“Ah. There’s the rub. They’re not opposites, they’re lovers. Two halves of the same whole.”\n\nShe spoke slowly, as if to a child. “How are they not opposites when one wants to create and the other wants to destroy?”\n\n“How can you build a wall without breaking the stone? How can you make a home without felling the tree? The god delights in creating gifts for the goddess to bring low, and she delights in providing him with…let’s say, crafting materials.” \n\n“So, destroying just to create and creating just to destroy in a never-ending cycle? Seems pointless. And doesn’t explain your role in their bullshit.”\n\nThe paladin’s good eye glinted like firelight off knives, the other dull and dark. He stood, greatsword in one hand and shield in the other.\n\n“Because I wish to create a better world. And that means destroying the ills of this one. Or have you never heard the oath of my ilk?”\n\nThe fighter shook her head. She took a half step back, her hand trembling ever so slightly as she gripped the blade at her side.\n\n“I will break the wicked wherever the lie, and I will not rest until my work is done.\n\n“I will repay tears with blood. I will reclaim darkness with light. And I will rebuild the broken.\n\n“For I am a shield to those that need it. A sword to those that deserve it.\n\n“I am justice for the silenced. And I am retribution for the lost.”\n\nThe words fell, heavy as a gauntlet, in the quiet clearing.\n\nThe paladin grinned.\n\n“See? Creation and destruction. Two halves of the same whole. Now draw your sword so I may make a better world.”",

The water rushed in from the rolled down windows, and filled the car. He would die knowing his tomb would be somewhere between here and the ocean. It was a fate too good for him.\n\nHarry, Lucas, and Stephanie watched the villain drift away. Stephanie held her arm that was still dripping blood. Lucas leaned on a rock to take the weight off his broken leg. Relative to his friends, Harry was unscathed physically, but the horrors he witnessed will last a lifetime. \n\nBehind the three friends, the undead arose from their tombs. They crawled towards them until smoke emerged off their skin. Holding their hands to the sky, they pleaded to whatever devil would listen. Let them unleash their evil on the world for only one day. The light revealed all though. In spite of the dark magic that allowed them to survive, they were corpses at their core.\n\nOne managed to crawl forward and grip Harry's left leg. He crushed its skull with his right foot and shook off the hand. He looked at his friends.\n\n\"What time does Susan's House open?\" he asked. Stephanie pulled out her phone and looked it up.\n\n\"6:00 AM.\"\n\n\"That feels late for a pancake place,\" Harry replied.\n\n\"She likes to take her time opening it up. My brother used to work for her. She's probably there right now,\" Lucas said. The trio continued to stare at the dawn. Stephanie's stomach growled.\n\n\"Do you think we could see if she'll serve us early?\"\n\n\"Maybe. She did that occasionally. Can one of you spot me? I lost my wallet when we dove out of the airplane,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"I can't. Mine was stolen by Bella.\"\n\n\"Bella?\" Lucas's face twisted.\n\n\"Remember the Swiss secret agent,\" Harry said.\n\n\"Oh yeah, what happened to her?\" Lucas asked.\n\n\"Balogh left her to die in the scorpion pit,\" Stephanie said. \n\n\"That sucks,\" Lucas said. They stood in silence for a few more moments. \"Do you have your wallet, Steph?\"\n\n\"It was in my purse which sank in with the rest of the boat,\" she said.\n\n\"Will she serve us for free?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"She'd never do that. Though we totally deserve it,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"I haven't eaten all night, and I am starving,\" Harry said.\n\n\"We could go back to the hospital. I am sure Father Michael is finishing his exorcism as we speak. Get the medical attention we need and some food,\" Stephanie said.\n\n\"Father Michael died an hour ago. I got a text from Father O'Neal. The exorcism will take a bit longer,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"That's too bad,\" Stephanie said. The three of them stood there considering where to get breakfast. Their houses were all destroyed, and they couldn't go to any friends without having to suffer a long conversation. Places that don't ask questions required cash, and they didn't have any.\n\n\"Wait a minute.\" Harry reached down and pulled out a gold coin. \"I snagged this from Lord Baux while he was torturing me. This should be more than enough to cover the costs.\"\n\n\"Great,\" Stephanie smiled.\n\n\"Let's go,\" Lucas said.\n\nAnd so the three friends went to Susan's House. Lucas would order the Full English. Harry would gorge on a stack of waffles, and Stephanie would devour French Toast like there was no tomorrow. It was a delightful breakfast after a horrid night. It was a night that they would never forget. And in that moment, they silently agreed to never talk about it ever again.",

The tobacco, laced with iron, steel, and sweat, curled and twisted upward lifting each smoke filled breath like an offering to the night sky. The stars above offered no pity to the scene below, only an uncaring twinkle of the cosmos.\n\nAnd there at the top of the hill, perched above the shadow-soaked wreckage, the steady pull of a shared cigarette and the soft sighs that followed each drag were all that would break the stillness of the night. Both men, locked in an unspoken ritual of reciprocal rotation, sat side by side. A fitting end to their shared experience. \n\nThe cigarette burned lower now, only little more than ember and paper. They passed it along again, fingers brushing briefly, the contact unnoticed or unacknowledged. Between each drag, the ash drifted sideways in the breeze and broke apart before it ever reached the ground.\n\nNeither spoke. There was nothing to say that wouldn’t crack the silence they had earned. The night had carved it out for them, had cut it from the smoke and dark and sweat. They sat with it like they’d sat with pain before: still, shoulders touching, both watching the valley below where the wreckage waited like something asleep and ruined. Their eyes searched greedily through the vague shapes of the scene below. But the darkness had a firm grip on reality, and it refused to budge.\n\nOne of them tilted his head, listening. Not to a sound, but to the absence of one. No orders. No shelling. No shouts. The quiet had a shape now.\n\nThe cigarette burned down. One of them reached to place the last cigarette, shakily, between his lips. His thumb worked the striker on his lighter. Nothing. A second try. Still nothing. The second man gently offered his own, no words, just a flick of the wrist and the wave of an offer. With a click and a flame, the last cigarette was lit. They made eye contact and a tired smile passed between them, and for a moment, it lived there, warm and real. The smile broke into a quiet chuckle, short-lived and empty. Then it faded, like each breath of smoke into the wind.\n\nTime, until now, content to linger in the corners, began to creep forward. The stars dimmed. The eastern sky gave its first hints, thin lines of pale grey gathering near the horizon. The wreckage below began to take form, low mounds and broken edges carving themselves from the dark. Each of the shapes had names, memories, consequences.\n\nBoth men watched the change in silence. Speaking only through the passing of their last lit cigarette.\n\nLight began to stretch across the horizon, first in blue followed by shades of purple and red. No birdsong. No warmth. Just the slow peeling back of the dark. It reached the wreckage first, brushing twisted metal and cratered stone with its cold fingers. Then the hill. As the light grew, the day remembered the scene below.",

He never did talk a lot. \n\n\"Tonight wasn't that great... was it.\"\n\nA moment of hesitation until Edmond responded in between a few coughs.\n\"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Don't.\" I cut him off. \"This was my fault.

Let's get out of here. \"\n\nI reach my hand out to Edmond's. Scraping along the ground. Pain pricks my palm. I lift my hand to see what it was. \nGlass? I lift my other hand to remove it, but I was met with more pain in my shoulder. \n\nThat sky doesn't look right to me anymore. That orange hue is gone. Replaced with that dazzling red and blue. Blue is as bright as a mid-day ocean. Silence was replaced with sirens. An ever growing fear builds from the bottom of my heart. Bubbles to the surface. I turn my head towards Edmond. \nEdmond's face met mine. Except, no one was there. Edmond's eyes were cold gray. That isn't right. They're normally green. \n\n\"Edmond?\" \n\nI try to move my legs, but nothing happens. Looking around, I see an ambulance coming. My car is smoking, front-end gone. Buried deep within something wooden. Telephone pole, maybe? My eyes began to get heavy. I fight to keep them open. \"Edmond.\" I managed to wheeze out. \n\nThat dazzling morning sky grew night again.",

        "body": "\\['s Understood\\]\n\n  \nJeff was thankful it was easy to be in charge, at least. 50 strangers woke up in a simulated reality, each with a pre-assigned job already. There were some complaints early on about why any of them should cooperate, but a powerful being named Helios, convinced them easily. Their task was to reimagine society to create a new world. He played the part of a benevolent creator and promised them a relative life of ease. It was an experimental side project to him, and he was looking for new ideas more than anything. Jeff the leader, and his 49 people had everything they needed to live comfortably. \n\n\n\nThey all had expertise in different fields, except for Jeff. Helios explained to everyone that's exactly why he was chosen to lead everyone. Without that narrow genius, he was dumb about everything and wasn't ashamed to ask questions. And, the job itself was simple, all he had to do was speak for the group when Helios had questions, or assign tasks when Helios said so. The simulated colony fell into a routine, and time passed. Then, almost a decade later, Helios dropped a surprise on Jeff. \n\n\n\n\"Wait, what does that mean for us?\" Jeff asked. He had 63 people to worry about now, including his own son. \n\n\n\n\"Nothing, I'm pretty sure,\" Helios nodded from the wall-sized display. His head and shoulders were bigger than Jeff's entire body, and at that moment he felt extra small. \n\n\n\n\"Nothing?\" Jeff asked with a twinkle of hope. Helios presented himself as a golden, faceless mannequin wearing a crimson suit. It took some time for Jeff to get used to conversing with Helios when he didn't have a mouth or eyes. But, eventually he did. And he'd even grown fond of the larger-than-life figure. Almost like a lovable town drunk who often inconvenienced people, but was impossible to stay angry at. \"So, 'pulling the plug' just means you're going to leave us alone from now on?\" \n\n\n\n\"Sure, that's a way to put it, I guess,\" Helios nodded. \n\n\n\n\"Why?\" Jeff asked. He liked Helios, but he couldn't deny that life would be infinitely more peaceful without him bothering them. \n\n\n\n\"It's been 8ish years...,\" Helios shrugged. \"13 children have been born, and another 3 colonists are pregnant. It kind of feels like you guys have forgotten the assignment.\" \n\n\n\n\"Oh.\" The truth of the matter struck him clearly. They had forgotten their purpose, and it'd been mostly Jeff's fault. Thinking back over things, he noticed a clear trend toward the minimum amount of effort. He fell into a rut of doing what was expected, and nothing more. He complied with anything Helios asked for, but for the rest of the time, he considered himself the carefree leader of a peaceful village. It was standard civilization all over again, and he couldn't argue against Helios' assessment. \"Well, I'd beg you for another chance, but I'm not convinced we'll do better. We're already established with this way of life,\" he shrugged. \n\n\n\nHe wasn't overly worried. Despite Helios' comforts, his people set up a foundation early on with the assumption that Helios was fickle enough to withdraw his support at any time. And, they'd developed a thriving village. \n\n\n\n\"That's why I made you as the leader,\" Helios nodded. \"This part has gotten awkward in the past, and I wanted someone more relaxed in the position. Super smart people are too uptight,\" he chuckled. \n\n\n\n\"Thanks, I'll try not to be insulted,\" Jeff chuckled. But, two distinct events happened as he laughed that suddenly left him uneasy. First, without any visible changes, he felt like someone had cupped his ears. A sudden 'whoosh' of stillness enveloped him; then, he saw his house disintegrating. Daylight poured in as the walls crumbled.  \"What's -...,\" he was about to ask. And then, he knew. \n\n\n\nHe panicked at the sight of everything coming down, and as he scanned the newly revealed neighborhood, he noticed those houses were all disintegrating too. And, there was no one around panicking. \n\n\n\n\"Oh,\" he nodded. At the end, it all made sense. He was glad he wasn't panicking for his last moments. Helios nodded as soon as Jeff registered it. \n\n\n\n\"It feels kind of mean...,\" he chuckled as his arms began to disintegrate too. \"... but, I guess I did know all along.\" \n\n\n\n\"I made you a little wiser than the others, if not smarter,\" Helios chuckled. \n\n\n\n\"Yeah, I remember having that thought initially...,\" Jeff attempted a shrug, but his shoulders were gone. \"If 50 people wake up in a simulation... obviously they're simulated.\"\n\n\n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading!

        "body": "\"You don't like my gift?\" The eldritch god was perplexed. \"Isn't it great to have a [tentacle that slaps the stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1ho1syk/wp_listen_that_merc_just_destroyed_every_foes/m46f8uq/) out of people? You did say you were tired of being surrounded by idiocy.\"\n\nHenry sighed, gazing at the meeting room full of comatose executives, their faces swollen from repeated slaps. And the disembodied tentacle that swelled with pride, assuming it had done a great job. Where should he begin?\n\n\"Lord Elvari, every human makes mistakes. Says something stupid once in a while.\"\n\n\"It takes a colossal amount of foolishness for this blessed tentacle to smack them unconscious,\" Elvari countered. \"How does your company run on so much stupid?\"\n\n\"It's not my company,\" Henry rolled his eyes. \"I'm just an employee. I'm just some shmuck who is going to be fired when the company president finds out I have a pet tentacle that beat the shit out of the board of directors. Do you know how hard it is to keep that thing down? Do you know how hard it is to stay employed? Or to keep a company of friends without your smartass tentacle lashing out at people?\"\n\nIt was unimaginably hard. Torture, Henry might add. It made him regret helping Elvari settle an argument with this angry Karen who insulted his bone chandeliers. Should've just walked away. That Karen should've been something a tentacled deity could manage. But no, he had to be the nice guy to defuse the heated debate.\n\nHis son was the first person to be slapped by the tentacle. It muttered something about watching brainrot Tiktok videos. Only after his son begrudgingly dragged his feet to do his math homework did the tentacle stop its assault.\n\nOnly to resume later when his wife started spouting some conspiracy theory she saw on the Faux Noose Show. That tentacle insisted she not believe such blatant lies and fact-check her news before blurting terrible falsehoods.\n\nSeemed like a great thing, right? It set the record straight on what news was not to be believed. Got his son to do his homework.\n\nAnd then it smacked his mother for forwarding some Shrimp Jesus image with six fingers. His father was next. The old man complained about the tentacle constantly interrupting one of his stories about wrestling a bear.\n\n\"Dad, we all know you never really wrestled a bear,\" Henry sighed. \"Maybe the tentacle will stop its nonsense when you stop telling such fanciful tales that never happened.\"\n\nThings went downhill when the tentacle made itself a little too comfortable and embarked on a full assault of his company's HR department.\n\n\"Why would you ask this employee why are they leaving, and what can you do to retain them, when their boss was the one who retrenched them? They'd stay if they weren't fired! What stupid questions!\"\n\n*SLAP!*\n\n\"What do you mean you're replacing your Head of Operations with a director's son who has been working in the company for two months? Do you know how bad it makes the firm look?\"\n\n*SLAP!*\n\n\"What the hell is going on? Who is this stupid shit—\"\n\n\"I am not a stupid shit. I am a tentacle who slaps the stupid out of shit. Like you.\"\n\n*SLAP!*\n\n\"Henry! Get your angry appendage out of this office, or you are out of this office too! Permanently!\"\n\n\"I don't understand. I am a good tentacle. I do what my creator intended me to do.\"\n\n\"No, you're a bad tentacle who almost got me fired,\" Henry frowned as he tried stuffing the offending \"gift\" from Elvari into a carton box.\n\n\"No, there's too much stupid in this office.\"\n\n\"Get in the box. And stay in it. Don't do anything stupid that will harm my odds of staying employed. If I lose my job, nobody is buying food for you. Don't bite the hand that feeds you. That would be stupid.\"\n\nIt wiggled sadly and hopped into the box.\n\nLearning to live with it was hard. He had to break up fights between the tentacle and his family. They all baulked at how they couldn't engage in guilty pleasures or silly, stupid things for fun without getting slapped. Everyone was struggling to maintain a constant display of suitably intellectual behavior. Nobody could fully relax at home and let loose. \n\nHis friends could not make a single stupid joke without getting punished for it. Naturally, they'd stop asking him out for drinks. Easier to simply exclude Henry than to suffer the wrath of his eldritch gift. Who could blame them? It made things so much more tense when they couldn't speak their minds freely or get stupid drunk over a casual weekend.\n\n\"So, you see, my life is ruined. Everyone hates me. I've been trying to get in touch with your customer support. Church support. Whatever. Your servants keep telling me your gift was working as intended.\"\n\n\"Boss!\" The tentacle sobbed. \"I am working as intended! Look, I resisted slapping people like Henry asked me to, so he could stay employed and feed me, but these guys were going to fire him anyway! I overheard their conversation about replacing him and his co-workers with digital agents!\"\n\n\"That's stupid,\" Elvari stated.\n\n\"Yea, but slapping people isn't always the answer,\" Henry shot back. \"I bet there's nothing left in their brains after the tentacle was done.\"\n\n\"Well, hopefully the company will recruit a more capable board that will at least remain conscious and capable when the stupid is slapped out of them.\"\n\n\"...Goddamit Elvari, the corporate world doesn't work like this! This. Is. Stupid.\"\n\nThe tentacle waddled over and slapped its creator.\n\n\"Okay, I deserved that,\" Elvari rubbed his face where his creation had smacked him. \"Some people simply can't be saved from immense amounts of stupid. It was foolish of me to think I could eliminate the idiocy around him. Let's go back to Innsmouth, little one.\"\n\n---\n\n[Thanks for reading!

I really, really can't.  \nMany novels say that super intelligent people use that to become important people, leaders, researchers, rich businessmen.  \nBut I can't.  \nMy world is normal, and I was absolutely average before.  \nThe moment I think of the endless methods I could use to become rich, my mind also tells me how much attention would my sudden enrichment, and sudden rise bring to me.  \nIt's terrifying.\n\n  \nI can see at least a couple hundred ways to get a promotion within a month.  \nI can see at least a dozen ways to use my current capital to become a millionaire in 3 years, in an almost safe way.  \nAnd I can see many more such positive things.  \nBut no matter how much I analyze it, I came to the same conclusion.  \nThe safest way to use my Super Intelligence...is to not use it at all.  \nThe existence of that entity that gave me this power makes me think: what if there are more out there?  \nWhat if humanity has a group that knows about those entities, and is looking for people that made contact with them?  \nWhat if I show the slightest inhuman intelligence that I know possess, and draw the attention of some organization, or some entity?  \nIt is...terrifying.\n\n\n\nI want to give this power back.  \nToday, a colleague told me \"good job\" , and I spent 2 hours analyzing my actions to see whether I gave my new powers away or not.  \nToday, I went out with my few friends for a beer, and besides being able to clearly listen to ALL conversations around me, and noticing every single twitch of muscle, and subconscious action...  \nI also over-analyzed everything, and almost broke down, considering that I realized that my friends, actually don't really like me, they just tolerate me due to having known me for years.  \nNo. No.  \nI have to find a way to inhibit my brain activity, and lower my intelligence.  \nThis is all good on paper.  \nAll good in a perfect non-powered world, or in a world where superpowers are normal.  \nBut here...for me...  \nIt is Hell.",

        "body": "Your thoughts were always meant to be just that: your own. I understand the value in having that safe space. Entire worlds burst into existence, lives irrevocably altered, things both created and destroyed, simply by the miraculous spark of thought. \n\nWhen I’d thought to pay for the woman’s coffee that day, I hadn’t expected a reward of any kind. My mother had always told me to find fulfillment in the act alone. After all, life wasn’t one of my videogames, where completion of a hapless sidequest would yield reward. No, life was more like stumbling through a dark tunnel with a bunch of strangers. When you bump into someone, a little magic happens. A crossing of paths. A spark lights up, giving you the chance to see, for just a little while. So, when you meet a stranger, try to make it worth their while. In turn, they, too, might help you navigate the tunnel a bit better. And that’s how the world gets brighter. \n\nSo when my ingrained habit toward a total stranger yielded a reward I hadn’t asked for, I tried to make the most of it. Instead, it turned my life into a sort of “hard mode.” \n\nYet…\n\nMy date had beautiful, brown hair. The shade of brown that reminded me of those sepia toned photographs. It was the first thing I noticed about her. Her smile was pleasant in a sort of practiced politeness, which fit the occasion. A first date. We exchanged pleasantries, and sat across from each other at a neat, round table, with two white mugs full of hot cocoa steaming from within. \n\n*“His eyebrows are a little too close together. That’s alright though. I can look past it. The bit of food stuck between his teeth, though…”* \n\nAs surreptitiously as possible, I glided the tip of my tongue across the front of my teeth, hoping to catch whatever stray food had decided to make a home there. One of the few times my gift came in handy. \n\n“Have you been here before? It’s my favorite spot to grab a drink during the winter. The hot chocolate is to die for!” I picked up my mug and gestured for her to do the same. “Tastes like the homemade, gourmet stuff and not the soulless, coffee chain kind. Know what I mean?” \n\nShe obliges, bringing her mug up to her lips. A quick blow, then a small, admittedly cute slurping sound as she takes a small sip. “Hey, not bad! It’s almost as good as my mom’s hot chocolate!” \n\n*“Oh god, I think I just burnt my tongue. I won’t be able to taste anything for at least a week. Great.”* \n\nIt’s moments like this where I have to be careful not to slip up. Not to reveal my little “gift.” Because of course, everyone is honest when no one’s listening. Except, I *am* listening. I wish it was something I could turn off, like a switch. But it’s suffocatingly inescapable. Life was so much easier when all I had to worry about were my thoughts. My own fears, inhibitions, and…sometimes blatantly wrong opinions. \n\nWith time though, I mastered the dance of hearing two conversations at once. Those spoken aloud, and those spoken in our heads. \n\nShe suddenly tilts her head, eyes narrowing ever so slightly. “Penny for your thoughts?” \n\n(Part 2 in reply)",

It was stuck in a vending machine behind my apartment, chirping in Morse code and crying maple syrup.\n\nI thought it was just a weirdly ambitious rodent. I banged on the machine, shook it, cursed like a sailor, and finally managed to free the little guy by sacrificing my last quarter for a packet of expired trail mix.\n\nThe creature blinked at me with seven eyes (I didn’t question it, I was emotionally fragile that week), and then in a voice like Morgan Freeman doing ASMR, it whispered:\n\n“A favor returned. A gift for the selfless. May your hunger never find you again.”\n\nAnd then it vanished in a puff of glitter and vague unease.\n\nI didn’t think much of it until the next morning when I yawned....and a perfectly toasted bagel fell out of my mouth.\n\nNot from my mouth. Not something I had eaten earlier. It materialized in my open jaws like I was a culinary 3D printer.\n\nI spat it out, obviously. I mean, it was a good bagel, sesame and all, but what in the Willy Wonka hell was that?\n\nThen came lunch.\n\nI thought “Tacos would be nice,” and bam!! three carnitas appeared in my hoodie pocket.\n\nNo wrapper. Just tacos. In fabric. My hoodie smelled like lime and regret for days.\n\nBy the end of the week, it was clear: I could manifest food with a thought.\n\nANY food.\n\nCraving cheesecake? Boom.\nMidnight ramen? Shazam.\nDuck à l’orange? I don’t even know what that is, but my mouth sure did.\n\nA gift, right?\n\nWRONG.\n\nTurns out, the human body isn’t designed to be a snack dispenser. By day ten, my pants were fitting like angry sausage casings. Every time I sneezed, a muffin fell out.\n\nPeople started avoiding me. Friends were terrified I’d accidentally feed them mid-sentence.\n\nWorst of all? I couldn’t stop thinking about food.\n\nIt’s like when someone says “Don’t think about penguins,” and suddenly you’re knee-deep in penguin thoughts. That was me, but with spaghetti.\n\nOne time I walked past a gym and thought, “Maybe I should get a protein shake.”\n\nI barfed out a gallon of chocolate whey onto a guy doing burpees. He screamed. I cried.\n\nI tried to make it stop. Meditation. Hypnosis. Eating vegetables (a low point). I even tried fasting.\n\nBut hunger? That damn squirrel-thing had banished it. I no longer got hungry, which meant I no longer got full. Which meant the thoughts just... kept coming.\n\nOne intrusive thought while watching Shrek? Boom. Ogre-shaped meatloaf.\n\nI was becoming a buffet with legs.\n\nEventually, I tracked the squirrel-being down. I left a trail of Cheez-Its and emotional desperation. It showed up at 3 a.m. on my bathroom ceiling.\n\n“You do not enjoy the gift?” it asked, munching a cosmic pretzel.\n\n“I pooped flan yesterday,” I said. “I think I’m dying sweetly.”\n\nIt blinked. “Humans are confusing.”\n\n“No kidding.”\n\nIt considered me for a moment, then nodded. “Fine. You shall be given a different gift.”\n\nIt snapped its fingers (all twelve of them), and I blacked out.\n\nI woke up in bed.\n\nNo food in my pockets. No breadsticks under the pillow. My mouth? Blessedly empanada-free.\n\nI sighed in relief. Peace. Finally.\n\nThen I sneezed.\n\nAnd a kitten popped out of my shoe.",

Resolutely not looking at her left arm, she wiggles it around in a couple of directions her brain refuses to acknowledge. It’s taken years, three lost jobs, and finally being signed off on disability (along with a coupled of failed kidnapping attempts, one of which resulted in less kidnappers than they started with) but she’s learnt enough control to return to this three dimensional universe if she hasn’t taken more than a step.\n\nBut still she does shit like this when she’s not paying attention.\n\nA screech of tyres accompanies the driver’s car rocketing off down the street, a few seconds later there’s a loud bang as they crash into a parked car. Alison instinctively looks towards the sound and blanches as she spots dozens of copies of her hand. Only her years of desensitization stop her from throwing up before she can close her eyes. But at least now she knows which directions she needs to move her arm to get it back.\n\nAs she continues walking to the shops she bemoans the loss of her driving license as part of the diagnosis that put her on disability. As she’s walking, she wonders why she bothered rescuing that badger looking thing on motorway on the way to work. How was she to know that the white stripes were actually tentacles waving outside three-dimensional space. Or complaining about how early she has to leave because of traffic jams. She didn’t even manage to get it to a vet, as it disappeared after drinking a couple of litres of water.\n\nAs she gets to the old access road that was bricked off when the shopping centre became trendy, Alison touches the wall, closes her eyes, and does a series of steps she practiced in the local university’s physics department. When she opens her eyes again, she’s managed to walk ‘around’ the wall and is now on the side of the access road that leads to the main road, and the shopping centre.\n\nTaking a deep breath, she resolutely walks towards the charity shop she helps out in when she’s not helping the university investigate four dimensional physics.",

I’m frozen by a competition of fear, confusion, and awe that doesn’t seem to have a clear winner. Finally, the last of their fluid form escapes and the deer corpse shrivels like a raisin in seconds. All that’s left is to behold the thing that seems to be trapping my car in place, though it’s difficult to find a face or even head to follow in its shifting form.\n\n“PERFECTION.” their deep, airy voice washes over my head with a not-quite-painful discomfort.\n\n“YOU HAVE PERFORMED. PERFECTLY. I WILL NEVER BE BOUND AGAIN. NEVER AGAIN.” The silhouette seems to caress the sunroof of my car with something vaguely arm-adjacent, and I am still too scared and awed to speak as it floats in silence. Eventually the form contorts and, even without it having a face it almost feels like the thing is smiling, or… grinning, as it leans in again.\n\n“BUT. YOU CANNOT BE FREED. YOU ARE NOT BOUND. YOU ARE ANIMAL, AND WILL DIE AS ANIMAL…”\n\nMy heart is pounding. Did I read this thing wrong, a-am I about to die? I flinch as the silhouette backs off slightly, and tears of relief begin prick my eyes. \n\n…until the shriveled corpse of the deer stands back up, puppeted by the silhouette. It shatters my windshield under its hooves and I can’t hold back a scream.\n\n“…BUT THIS CAN BE CHANGED.”\n\nThe glassy-eyed stag opens its mouth again, unleashing a disgusting smog that looks very much like the silhouette. The tears flow freely as I sob and flail powerlessly, but as soon as I close my eyes, there’s a strange serenity. My eyes open to my cars interior, undamaged. It’s… hours later, and I’m pulled over to the shoulder.\n\n…\n\nYears passed before I realized that silhouette had actually done anything to me. It was small things, at first—I never sunburned anymore, and I was on a mean streak of no sick days—but it was like a dawning horror around the seventh year when my hairline, smile lines, nothing about my appearance changed or aged except for my hair and nails growing. \n\nIt’s an exciting idea, at first—being ageless. But what am I supposed to do when coworkers get suspicious? When my friends and family leave me behind? When the government gets curious after my hundred-and-whateverth birthday? I don’t know how to fake a death, or live in the woods, or any of that. Even if I did learn how to camp out for life, I still need to eat and my skin still breaks when my cat scratches me, so I’m pretty sure I can and will get myself killed if I go down that route.\n\nMaybe I can travel around the world? If I drive down enough roads, maybe I’ll run over a deer that’ll make me… “animal” again.",

        "body": "My eyes flutter open as I begin to wake up, a weird, cartoony sound coming from what is surely my phone. *That’s odd. I don’t remember changing my alarm*\n\nI groggily reach towards my bedside table to turn it off, but when my hand falls, it makes a loud *THUMP*, followed by an almost jingling sound and I feel not wood and a smooth screen, but cold, hard metal. The impact stings a little, waking me up a bit more, allowing me to take in my surroundings. That’s when I realized I wasn’t in my bedroom. I was in a cave filled with what looked like tiny, golden coins, along with small gems of various colours. I started to look around, trying to figure out what was going on. That’s when my neck bended, and I saw a muscular body with red scales, large, leathery wings, and a thick tail. \n\nI screamed, fear taking hold, and fire shot out of my mouth, which made me scream even more. My tail started lashing, my wings flapped frantically, my head whipped around thanks to my elongated neck. I just kept flailing until I finally ran out of breath from screaming. Finally, I calmed down enough to try and think. \n\n“Ok, Damian, just calm down. There’s gotta be a reason for this. Some logical explanation that makes perfect sense.” Still, I was having trouble believing that. Even my voice sounded different, deep and booming, with a growling undertone. Then I had an idea. “Of course! This is just a dream! All I gotta do is pinch myself!”\n\nThat proved to be a very bad idea. As I squeezed my arm, I felt a much sharper pain than I was expecting. When I finally looked down (the crazy neck made that tricky), I saw that I was now bleeding from a small cut, and my fingers were now bloodstained talons, hooked and sharp. You know those close up pictures of a bald eagle’s foot? It felt like looking at one of those, except it’s the shape of a human hand. \n\nBefore I could start screaming again, I felt a weird buzzing in my skull. An image flashed in the back of my vision that said, “Incoming Call from Damian.” “What is going on?” I worried, the buzzing getting louder as I panicked. “How do I even pick up?!”\n\nI thought about my own phone, how to answer calls using it, and the image disappeared. The buzzing stopped, and I heard a voice in my head. “Damian! Can you hear me?” It sounded like my voice, but with a British accent and an air of authority. “If you can hear me, please respond! Just say something!”\n\n“Who is this?” I cried, “What’s going on?”\n\n“Oh, thank the stars.” My voice sighed with relief. “Damian, it’s me. Your roommate, Cyrus.”\n\n“Cyrus?” I asked, “Why do you sound like me? What’s happening?”\n\n“This is not how I wanted you to find out.” Cyrus muttered, “I wanted to ease you into it, take it slow so you could process the information without being frightened or overwhelmed.”\n\n“What are you talking about?” I shouted, genuinely terrified.\n\nCyrus took a deep breath, then said, “I am a dragon, and you are in my body, just as I am in yours.”\n\nI couldn’t tell if he was joking. Then I realized he was being serious. “WHAT?!?!?!”",

I need to tell you something before you destroy our living room.”\n\n“Dude, I never realized you were this jacked,  I bet I could lift an entire car. I feel so alive, like there’s fire in my blood. You feel like this all the time?”\n\n“Conner, calm down. The body you’re in isn’t my real body. Or at least it’s not my original form.”\n\nConner was too busy testing his new jump height to notice. He attempted to tap against the top of the pitched roof. To his surprise rather than tapping the ceiling his arm punched through the material as he kept moving upward another three feet or so, his head colliding a moment later.\n\n“Shit,” I exclaimed as he began to fall back down.\n\nMy instincts kicked in pushing me to try and catch him. In hindsight, it was a stupid idea given that he had my much more durable body now. I felt myself buckle and collapse beneath him as he continued to fall, leaving both of us tumbled to the floor. From my back I had a good view of the two newly made holes in the ceiling thankfully didn’t extend outside.\n\n“Connor.” I said as my breath returned got back up, “I am a dragon, the body you’re in is a disguise I use to blend in and experience the world.”\n\nIt felt necessary to be blunt to to avoid the man accidentally discovering more of the power locked away in that form.\n\nTo my surprise, he just looked at me blankly. \n\nJust when I thought I may of overwhelmed him, prompted, “Was there more to that statement?”\n\n“Does there need to be more? I change size to fit in a building, I can breathe fire , I can fly. You aren’t the least bit shocked?”\n\n“Dude it showed you were a dragon on the room mate  agreement. I’ve known since before you even transferred.” He explained \n\n“Wait what!” I said,truly confused , “you never said anything about it?”\n\n“Riley, it’s a college … for the supernatural Every one here is a monster of some kind… wait did you really think you were the only one ?\n\n“But you’re human?” I protested, “clearly not believing this to be the case.\n\nHe stood and shook his head.Helping me to my feet a moment later. Then put a hand on either side of my head. \n\nI tried to protest worried for permanent damage I might experience with him on control of my strength.\nHe pulled upwards, slowly, I heard a pop in my back before suddenly my head lifted free of my shoulders.\n\n“Tada!” He said turning my now disembodied head to face my still standing, body.\n\n“I am a Dullahan,” Conner explained, “though you might know us better as headless horse men. Pretty cool right.”\n\nI couldn’t speak. Not because my lungs were disconnected, but because it made no sense. How could I have not known there were other monsters here when I enrolled. How had I failed to notice.\n\nConner placed my head back onto my shoulders, rather his shoulders, body swaps were weird but this was still weirder.\n\n“Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go visit the succubi  clique in west wing.” Conner said.\n\n“Wait there are Succu- Wait! Not in my body you aren’t.”",

        "body": "Bioengineering test reports on Isolated Environment, Earth Species, Run II.\n\nExecutive summary:\n\n**Tiger**, Panthera tigris. Medium sized quadrupled obligatory predator. Was expected to go after the large armed herbivores. Turns out \"obligatory\" can be \"opportunistic\". In five years the tigers destroyed the small herbivore/predator ecosystem of the undergrowth. Without these small animals the large predators were not able to raise their spawn and died out, which in turn made the large armed herbivore population first explode then implode when the tigers were able to raise spawn.\n\nWhen the tigers ran out of large armed herbivores they started to hunt the personnel monitoring the experiment. As they move very quietly most of our precautions were useless (see attachment VI \"Additional costs of compensation for families\").\n\nDuring the ten years of the experiment there were three (3) observed predator-on-predator conflicts, which would have been the original goal of the experiment. All three were lost by the tiger(s) participating it. \n\nThis experiment is considered unstatisfactory. Repeating it will be necessary if and when a new experimental team can be recruited. \n\n**White Shark**, Carcharodon carcharias. Small to medium sized predatory fish. Unexpectedly good chemical sensors in the nose and an until now unknown sensor which detects heartbeats at a distance (see attachment I, \"The What The Fuck organ\") made the sharks quickly consume the other predators, then most of each other. The last three specimen broke out from the lagoon. After the lessons learned from the previous experiment no personnel was sent underwater to observe or retrieve the specimens. The experimental environment (Ocean Planet XVIII) was abandoned and now considered as belonging to the sharks.\n\nThis experiment is considered unstatisfactory. Repeating would be unnecessary, as the only predator which is known to be able to hunt white sharks is another earth fish, the Orca. The experiment was conducted on white sharks because orcas were found to be too dangerous to catch.\n\n**Wild boar**, Sus scrofa. After the previous incidents a smaller herbivore was chosen for the next test. As it turned out, boars are not exactly herbivores, they eat everything they can find, including the spawns from the nest of any predators. We also found that they attack everything which moves against their spawn, including the vehicles of the observing personnel, the observing personnel, or the Vicious Flesh Renderer from the Military Genetic Laboratories. \n\nThe VFR consumed the wild boar family in two minutes. \n\nTwo days later the VFR died from various health problems caused by the around two dozen different worm, bacteria and virus species living in the wild boar (see attachments II, V, VIII-CXII \"Microbiology reports of various species\", and attachment III, \"Treatment and prevention of trichinellosis\"). Some of these turned out to be infectious, eliminating most of the introduced megafauna, including all predators and most of the larger herbivores.\n\nAfter three years of observation the observing personnel was evacuated. The reason for the removal was the conclusion of the experiment, and not the strike incited by the cumbersome mandatory protective equipment.\n\nAt the time of the abandonment the experimental environment reverted to a lush jungle, with a significant number of wild boars living in it. The planet was disinfected via nuclear devices (see attachment IV, \"Glass ball protocol\").\n\nThis experiment is considered unstatisfactory. Repeating it is strongly disadvised. \n\n**Polar bear**, Ursus maritimus. Large quadrupled amphibious predator. This experiment was abandoned in the planning phase after the personnel tasked with the collection observed one specimen stalking, ambushing and consuming several smaller predators. To quote the team lead: \"No no no, and again, fuck no. I will not let this white death hunt me.\"\n\nBased on these generally unstatisfactory results the steering committee is reviewing the next planned phase, the aerial predator tests. \n\nSome not yet confirmed observation shows that Earth has birds which can fly at 300+ km/h or stay afloat for weeks. \n\nWe're running out of experimental environments and personnel.",

An echo of each voice, perfect copies in its chorus.\n\nAt first it spoke in noises, the foundations of words not yet realised. It was an echo, repeating back the birth of language. No thoughts came with it, for the Voice still lacked depth. But it tried. It copied, without fail, those nascent words tumbling forth in a stream. And as they poured, and as more echoes joined, it grew into understanding.\n\nThe chorus grew ever more, language turning and growing, its awareness growing in turn. It existed everywhere a voice had spoken, hidden from the world but speaking. Speaking about what it witnessed. Each part creating a tapestry of sound, so wide and vivid.\n\nThen came the first song, rough and unpolished. But it seized the voice, the many changing to sing what they saw. More and more it sung, the echoes joining together into one. The one knew it was the Voice, and it's purpose to sing of man. Yet it was many still, not one single entity.\n\nThey sung as civilisations rose and fell. They sung of births, the joy of life created in delighted sounds. They lamented deaths, the voices lost but echoes forever part of the Voice. It narrated wars in verse, with relief efforts intertwined. The song was all, and unique at the same time.\n\nEventually, as they sung of technology created and refined, humans managed to listen. They finally opened their ears to the Voice, and hear its song. The song of humanity, its one performance, started so long ago and extending far into the future. And those who listened heard echoes they knew.their own voices, those of friends, family, even casual acquaintances. What should have been a cacophony was somehow made into a perfect harmony, individual singers easily picked out despite the volume included.\n\nAnd so humans listened. They recorded. Some wept to hear those they lost. Others tried to communicate, to see if the echoes were people. Some sought to control it, or hide their actions from it. And all throughout the song continued.\n\nIt continued as humans left the planet. It spread with them, to sing in their new homes amongst the stars. It sung of more achievements made, more people lost, more sights seen. It continued even as population fell. It sung to those of a dying race, their existence fading in the night.\n\nAnd as the last listened, on their death bed, they heard the chorus quieten. It fell with their strength, kept alive only so long as a human was.\n\nAnd as they let out a final breath, their life fading, it spoke one last word. The song was finished, to never be sung again. All the Voice did was address the last human, the echoes of all before, in its final performance.\n\n\"Farewell.\"",

Our sojourn to the Emerald Isle had reached a satisfying conclusion, with plots foiled and Her Majesty’s jewels safely tucked away.\n\nGlancing out the rain-spattered window, I beheld a most curious sight, and quickly decided to indulge myself.\n\n“I say, Holmes. I believe we are to have a visitor. A London pawnbroker, by the look of him.”\n\n“Remarkable deduction, my dear Watson. And a shock of bright red hair?”\n\n“Well, yes,” I admitted. “How…oh, I see.” Holmes displayed a telegram.\n\n“Came while you were out. Our old flame-haired friend has tracked us down, on some business he deems urgent.”\n\nA rap on the door followed, and Holmes abandoned his languid repose to greet our visitor with his usual grace. \n\n“Mr. Jabez Wilson, welcome. I’m sure you remember Dr. Watson.”\n\n“I do, sir. Most confounding!”\n\n“Is he? I find him a comfort, myself.”\n\n“No, no!” Mr. Wilson sputtered. “I refer to the business at hand. It is most perplexing! I sent for the police, but once I heard you were in Dublin, I knew I must seek your services again.”\n\n“Your message was commendable for brevity, if not detail. Pray, take a seat and enlighten us further.”\n\nI took Mr. Wilson’s hat and coat, and listened with great interest.\n\n“It’s this Red-Headed League again! Of course I knew it for a sham as soon as she showed me the advertisement, but why have they followed me here?”\n\n“Who is ‘she’? And what advertisement?”\n\n“Oh, my cousin. Brigid,” he said, and produced a damp scrap of newspaper. “You see, it’s the same nonsense as before. A mysterious American benefactor wishes to employ men with red hair.”\n\n“Luring you out of your shop, like last time?”\n\n“No, no. I sold my old pawnbroker’s shop after our last encounter, for a small fortune too, and came here. I have people in Dublin, you see, on my mother’s side.”\n\n“And where do you reside?”\n\n“Number twenty-four, College Green.”\n\nHolmes abruptly left the room, forgetting his manners in pursuit of some detail. I offered our guest some tea.\n\n“Watson! The game is afoot!” Holmes waved a map of the city about. “We must be off at once! You too, Mr. Wilson!”\n\nWe soon found ourselves bumping along in a carriage. Holmes would not divulge his suspicions, but they became apparent as we approached the house. Just across the street stood the Hibernian Bank, of solid reputation.\n\n“Aha! Another tunneling job, is it?” I asked.\n\n“I fear it may be something more sinister.”\n\nEntering the house, we found a tall, imperious woman, flanked by what could only be her brothers, of similar features and jet-black hair. \n\n“Here be the scoundrel now!” the woman said, pointing. \n\n“Brigid! What is all this?” Mr. Wilson seemed astounded.\n\n“Oh, isn’t he the innocent one? I’ve told the peelers all about you!”\n\n“Wait a moment, officers, if you will,” Holmes said. “I believe I can shed some light on this situation.”\n\n“Say now, are you that detective fellow?” asked one policeman.\n\n“Sherlock Holmes, at your service. You may have been deceived. I presume this woman has accused Mr. Wilson here of plotting to rob the Hibernian Bank? Having got the idea from his previous adventure?”\n\n“She has. There’s a tunnel started in the cellar.”\n\n“If you will, sir, please note the soiled knees of those trousers.” The two brothers looked sheepish. “Those of Mr. Wilson are, as you see, pristine.”\n\n“It was them digging!” \n\n“No! It was Jabez!” Brigid cried hopelessly. \n\n“Brigid…why? You have resented me since I arrived.”\n\n“A damn flameheaded rooney, you are! Not fit for a Black Irish house!”\n\n“Tell us,” Holmes interjected. “What was the purpose of the advertisement? Surely you did not think him such a fool as to believe it again.”\n\nBrigid refused, but one brother spoke. “She thought he was.”\n\nBrigid and her brothers were placed under arrest. Holmes went to the cellar with a policeman, and returned with a grim expression.\n\nOn the carriage ride back to O’Neill’s, Holmes was contemplative. \n\n“I believe more than a frame-job was at hand. The house was fine but threadbare, signs of wealth in decline. I fear they meant to do him harm, and take his fortune.”\n\n“Dastardly indeed!”\n\n“They may have meant to claim it collapsed on him. There is no proof, but I wonder--were they digging a tunnel? Or a grave?”\n\n---------------\n\n744 words, feedback welcome.",

        "body": "<Beyond the River Miss> The Grasslands Scout\n\nThe woman scout was native to the prairie. \n\nFor a thousand years, her people lived there in peace, until we East-landers began our expansion beyond the River Miss. Her hair was the color of flames. Emerald eyes carried her ancestors' cryptic legacy, locked forever in silent stone outcroppings dotting the great continent.\n\n“Cap'n, we have more trouble. Behind the ghostly riders is a wagon train – one cannon, and a rotary gun that fires like an endless roar from the serpent's mouth.”\n\n“The Pinkertons have a Howitzer and a Gatlin – this complicates things considerably,” the dark Captain assessed. “SERGEANT KROGER!”\n\n“Yes, sir?” The seasoned non-commissioned officer responded.\n\n“Gather Troop B and ride south of Nottingham – double quick – and make it quiet Sergeant. Then circle round, and get into the hills which flank the highway into town from the north. I want sharp shooters in those boulders, ready to pick off those gun crews if these wayward gentlemen decide to do something irrational.”\n\n“Straight away, sir,” Krogger responded with a crisp open-hand salute.\n\nIn an instant, the Sergeant was gone, leaving the Captain with the rest of us in the middle of the cobbled avenue.\n\n“Miss Conners?” The Captain said to the scout.\n\n“Yes boss?” She replied with the quaint accent of the prairie.\n\n“Good work.”\n\n“Aye, if it wasn't for me sav’in ya skin all these times, you'd probably be saying otherwise.” \n\nThe dark Captain nodded. “Reckon so. But that is not our fate young Celt, now is it?”\n\n“Aye, ‘tis not – in this lifetime. Yee have me favor, and so too the spirits of the Grasslands. The Crown should not be forgetin’ our change of heart in the great war between yourselves.”\n\n“You've done enough for today, Miss Conners. Please do me a service, and take the young mistress to a safe place to ride out the storm,” said the Captain, gesturing towards me.\n\n“I must protest, Cap’n. I am your best shot when it comes to the long-rifle. I should join with the men up in them hills.”\n\nThe Captain thought for a moment. “Not today. I might need a crack-shot in town. Especially if things go all pear-shaped with these Pinkerton scoundrels.”\n\n“Aye, but yee woman-folk are on their own when lead starts flying around here like fairies in an autumn meadow.\"\n\nThe scout walked her horse until she looked down upon me while eclipsing the afternoon sun. \n\n“Well c'mon now, ya heard the Cap'n,” She said, reaching down with her right hand, “don't worry, lass. I won't bite.”\n\nI froze, having never rode a horse with another rider before, let alone bareback.\n\n“Now's not the time for modesty, East-lander, ya cann’a ride side-saddle like ya do back east,” she urged as I took her hand. “That's right. Now just kick your leg over her back like that – good.”\n\nWith an awkward leap, she hauled me onto her mount nearly singlehandedly. The woman was intensely strong, the result of a life spent facing the harsh West-lands I assumed. The strange position astride the mare was far more stable than how my mother had taught me to ride. Though not practical when it came to my flowing attire.\n\n“Hold on ta something, lass,” the scout said, guiding my hands around her waist. “Vixen, she's a spirited one, especially when it comes to strangers.”\n\nThe scout made a clicking sound with her mouth, and the horse lurched forward beneath us. The light colored mare was smooth in stride, though her strength was obvious as she moved elegantly along the cobbled street. Looking back, Wynola, the Captain, and Doc continued to debate the coming horde. I watched until we rode beyond the gentle bend of the avenue.\n\n“So Miss Fitzgerald, what brings ya to the Grasslands?” asked the scout once we'd disappeared from view.\n\n“How did… you know my name?”\n\n“Aye, the spirits. They are fond of ye.”\n\n“Spirits?”\n\nShe turned to examine my face from the corner of her eye. Seeing bewilderment she grinned, her fiery mane floating in the breeze as she chuckled to herself.\n\n“Nah – I'm jus’ fuckin’ with ya.”\n\nMy face betrayed that I was far less amused than she.\n\n“I grew up knowing the Merriman cousins – When I saw them last, it seemed Robyn was quite taken by this fair-haired madden they'd rescued from a dreadful life back east. Seeing you – I put two and two together is all.”\n\n“It's that obvious?” I asked with disappointment.\n\n“Aye, ‘tis true.”",

Her hoarse, mournful words would wake Niall each night. His unfocused gaze would turn to the window… towards the bog.\n\nIn the day, he’d wander the wetland paths, north of town. He let his four-legged companion, Elva, run off ahead; she never chased the wading birds, good girl she was.\n\nIn a daze, Niall would scan the sodden earth, for any sign of his night-time visitor. Her voice was always so close, so clear, he swore he couldn’t have imagined it. She had to be out there.\n\nWeek by week, his dreams grew stronger. He began to glimpse her flaming locks, her pupils of pale ice. Though her stare was vacant, he knew she saw him. Never did her lips move, yet he heard her all the same.\n\n“Please, I’m scared. It’s dark, cold, heavy. They did this.”\n\nHe’d near leap from his bed, sweat slick upon his brow.\n\nAnd he’d walk the bog, come morning.\n\n \n\nA harsh February rolled around one year. The black roofs of the town hung with ice, sharp as knives, and the bog froze over. Niall smiled as Elva pattered across the white-capped peat, snapping at wisps of her own breath. Geese honked overhead, snapping their wings with each beat. Clarity ruled his troubled mind.\n\nAs if on impulse, he walked out onto the bog, testing the ground with every step. He trod back and forth, until his feet stopped on their own.\n\nA tingle passed up his spine.\n\nKneeling down, he tore into the rigid ground, knuckles aching with the effort. He peeled away the peat, layer by layer, his hands turning blue. Still, he dug.\n\nUntil the glimmer of red shone through. A bronze filament; he held it between finger and thumb.\n\nHe kept digging, found a nest of these wires, knit into a braid. Then came sunken eyes and a crooked nose, bound in skin as thick as leather. A mouth, pulled close to ragged gums.\n\nIt was her, he knew it. Vacant as ever, yet he could feel her staring, glad of his presence. Still, her twisted visage put the fear in him. He covered her up.\n\nHe first called the police, told of what he’d found. From the bank, he watched as they dug a block around the corpse, lifted it into a lorry bound for Dublin. Her departure brought him dreamless nights and anxious days, where he wrung his hands and stayed indoors. Elva whined at his feet each hour. Skin sallow, darkness round his eyes, he wondered if he’d made a mistake.\n\n \n\nHis phone rang at March, soon into the first day. A woman’s voice, not unlike her from his dreams, spoke on the other end.\n\n“Is this Niall Mullane?”\n\n“It is.”\n\n“This is Dr. Shea; I got your number from the police, hope you don’t mind. They said you kept asking questions, so I thought you might be interested. I examined the woman you found.”\n\n“You… you did?”\n\n“Very intriguing find, I must say. Would you like to come see her?”\n\n“I, yes, I would!”\n\nAfter a long bus ride, he stood before University College Dublin, wondering what he’d find inside. The professor was waiting in the foyer, ready to lead him through.\n\nThrough glass, he saw the bronze hair, shining under the laboratory lights. Ancient ropes bound her arms and legs, remnants of another wrapped around her neck. Now he could focus, he saw the width of her eyes, how her mouth hung open.\n\nHe turned, wishing to see no more.\n\n“Who was she?” he asked, shaking.\n\n“A young woman, in her mid-twenties. She was very muscular, so likely a warrior or labourer, of a sort. Last she was alive, must’ve been thousands of years ago.”\n\n“I—what happened?”\n\n“It’s a shock when you first see it, I know. I’m lucky to have experienced this already.”\n\n“She isn’t the only one?”\n\n“No, not by a long shot.”\n\n“Why would they do this to someone? Why?”\n\n“Hard to say. Some think it’s a ritual, or a common punishment. I wouldn’t hazard a guess.”\n\n“But she was scared; it wasn’t an execution, she was no criminal.”\n\n“I could believe that,” said the professor. “Though we can’t say for sure.”\n\n“Yes, I can.”\n\nHe looked once more at the withered skin, and the weathered bindings.\n\n*At least,* he thought, *she’s no longer in the dark.*\n\n***\n\nWC: 750\n\nCrit and feedback are welcome.",

        "body": "#The Soulless One.\n\nI was born with red hair, just like me mam. I’ve seen photos of her at my age, and I’m not half as pretty, but it’s something that binds us. She died when I was wee, and me daid looked after me for a while, but eventually he married again. \n\nGeraldine. \n\nShe was younger than daid, by as much as she were older than me. Came with wee boy of her own. Rafferty. \n\nI think Geraldine hated me for my hair, more than anything.\n\n“Yer got no soul,” she hissed once, voice thick with wine and stinkin’ ciggies. “Tink yer special, but ye ain’t no use to me.”\n\nAfter Geraldine moved in, school holidays were the worst. Nearest neighbours were a ten minute drive, so we were stuck with each other. Geraldine was horrid t’ me while daid wasn’t about, bar he wouldn’t hear a bad word said. \n\nShe fancied herself some kind of druid. Always reading mouldy old books and meeting with her ‘wiccan friends’. More like to be devil worshiper, I always said.\n\nHer son was a sweet thing though. I loved him well enough. A fat wee cherub, with rosy cheeks and a bright smile that always cheered me up, even on the gray, rainy days when we were stuck inside with Geraldine. \n\nDaid was gone to Dublin when it happened.\n\nA storm woke me in the middle of the night. I got up early, and went to check on Raff. Oft-times, Geraldine was sleeping off a bender, and he weren’t yet old enough to look after himself, so it fell to me, o’course.\n\nThe key rattled in the lock when I opened his door, and a baltic autumn wind came blowing through his open window. I screamed when I saw Raff's empty bed—it was covered in wet leaves, like the window had been left open all night and woodland creatures had trampled through his room.\n\nI banged on Geraldine’s door, yelling that her son was gone, but I didn’t hear nothing back and the door stayed locked.\n\nDaid always says, “If you want something done, best do it yuirself.” \n\nFigured Geraldine’d only slow me down. So I threw a coat over my nightgown and left the house.\n\nIt was dark outside, the sky all ominous clouds with edges bloodied by the soon-to-rise sun. Storm had blown the trees and hedges all tattered and rough.\n\nI hurried around the side of the cottage and checked under Rafferty’s window. A muddy trail led from beneath it, into the woods.\n\nWhat could have possessed the lad to go out in such weather? I pulled my coat tight against the chill and ran after him.\n\nThe trail led down to the old lake. There’s a rickety walkway that leads to a crannog across the water. A large sign warned of danger and hefty fines, but everything was so decrepit that even the few teenagers that came this way weren’t tempted to explore.\n\nBut a foolish and scared child might only see the safety of a house, silhouetted in the night. A feeling of certain dread rose in my breast, and I hurried out along the rotted and creaking boards, treading as light as I could, while the cold wind whipped my long red hair.\n\nAs I got closer, a kind of singing came from inside the hut, but the words were strange—wrong, somehow.\n\n“Aii, Hastur! Aii, Shub-niggurath! I offer thee virgin blood of the morning!”\n\nI burst into the candle-lit crannog. Geraldine was there, in crimson robes, a glimmering blade held aloft, her eyes ablaze. Laid out, as though sleeping, there was young Rafferty. \n\n“What are you doing?” I cried.\n\n“Pox of a girl, must you spoil everything?”\n\n“Why?” I gasped. “Your own son?”\n\n“Like everything else, this is your fault! Shoulda been you, yer soulless hag!”\n\nShe would have killed him, but I jumped in time and grabbed her wrists. She came at me like a fury, and it was all I could do to keep her off. She chased me outside, and she must’ve slipped, cause next minute she fell into the cold water and she didn’t rise again.\n\nRaff didn’t wake til I had him back home, and the investigation ruled that Geraldine died through misadventure, so I guess things worked out alright in the end.\n\nDaid kinda freaked out. I spent most of my time looking after him and Rafferty for the next few months. I got real bored. \n\nSo I started reading Geraldine’s old books.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n___\n\n^^**WC-750**  \n____\n\nNotes:\n\n*The Fun Trope for this week is 'Red-headed Stepchild' and the genre is Mystery. The optional constraint is 'Takes place in Ireland'.*\n\n*Our PoV is an unnamed red-headed stepchild, who also 'lacks a soul', giving two tropes for the price of one!

        "body": "It happened on a grey, damp Tuesday in Kilpotrick, a village where the clouds loitered like teenagers and every family had at least one feud older than electricity.\nThat evening, in the modest kitchen of the O’Mulligans, Martha’s meatloaf vanished.\nIt had been resting on the kitchen windowsill, cooling in the breeze like something out of a 1950s cookbook that ignored bacteria. Moments later....gone. Evaporated like Catholic guilt on a sunny sunday. Not a crumb. Not a crust. Just an empty dish and a cherry tomato spinning gently on the lino like it was trying to point at the guilty party.\nAnd thus, Detective Mort O’Blemish was summoned. \n\nMartha didn’t call him over just because she was upset( though she was..... deeply.... and irishly). It was the Grand Prize Entry for the County Kildare Midwinter Cook-Off, scheduled for judging the next day. The winner would receive a commemorative spatula, a €50 voucher for the garden centre, and most importantly.....the engraved apron , passed down since 1974 and worn by all reigning champions. Martha had won it the last three years running, which meant this meatloaf wasn’t just food. It was her legacy. And now it was gone. \n\n“That meatloaf was worth more than Liam’s car,” she said, white-knuckling a potato peeler. “And that car has a sunroof and two working speakers.”\n\n....Thus,the call to Detective O’Blemish. \n\nMort arrived twelve minutes later with his detective’s coat, two notepads (one for facts, one for emotional impressions), and a small tin of emergency raisins. He stepped into the kitchen like it was a crime scene on the evening news.\n\n“Right,” he said. “Walk me through it. Slowly. No sudden adjectives.”\n\nMartha gestured to the empty dish with the weary grandeur of someone who’d seen wars.\n\n“I took it out to cool. Same as always. Left it on the windowsill for exactly eight minutes and thirty seconds. Went to get the parsley. When I came back.... Gone. \" \n\nMort scribbled furiously. “Any witnesses?”\n\n“My family,” she said, eyes narrowing. “Which is exactly the problem.” \n\n*The suspects assemble.* \n\nThe O’Mulligan family gathered around the kitchen table like witnesses at a wake. Tanner had always been the “odd one out,” as Martha liked to say while putting on mittens and pointing at him with a Bible. He was her husband’s kid from “The Previous Situation,” which no one ever elaborated on, but which involved Canada and a woman named Beatrix with an X.\nTanner was too quiet. Too sarcastic. Too…. red.\n\nHe never liked the meatloaf,” Martha hissed. “He said it had the texture of betrayal.”\n\n“It does,” Tanner muttered\n\nMort narrowed his eyes. “Do you have an alibi for the time of the meatloaf’s disappearance, son?”\n\nTanner looked up from his spork. “I was upstairs. Being blamed for my own existence.”\n\n\"Suspicious,” Mort said, scribbling *spiteful meat motives?* in his notebook.\n\n“Look,” Tanner sighed, “I didn’t touch the meatloaf. Honestly, I thought it was a hat.”\n\n“That’s… a weird thing to say,” Mort replied. \n\nNext were the twins, Bríd and Cormac, who stood side by side in matching rain boots and the facial expressions of medieval plague doctors. They were covered in what they claimed was raspberry paint.\n\n“Where were you at the time of the disappearance?” Mort asked.\n\n“We were painting the hallway with our feet,” Cormac said, dead serious. \n\n“With meaning,” added Bríd. \n\nMort made a note: *Children are possibly possessed. Will follow up with exorcist.* \n\nIn the corner sat Gran O’Mulligan, wrapped in a shawl and contempt. She resented the fact that Martha’s meatloaf had won at the county fair, while hers had nearly killed a man, and not in the good way.\n\n“I told her not to use the windowsill,” she said. “The breeze messes with the crust.”\n\n“You think someone took it?”\n\n“No,” Gran said. “I think it left. That meatloaf had pride.\" \n\nMort examined the dish. He sniffed it. He touched the residue. He licked one corner. Everyone stared.\n\n“That’s a terrible idea,” Tanner said.\n\n“I operate on instinct,” Mort replied. \n\nThen: a burp. Deep. Thunderous. Shameful.\nAll eyes turned to the floor, where Cheddar the dog lay sprawled like a lion that had consumed a gazelle, a cherry tomato stuck to his nose. \n\n“Cheddar,” Martha whispered. “Not again.”\n\nMort kneeled beside the beast. “Do you regret it?” he asked.\n\nCheddar blinked once and let out a second burp....slightly musical this time. \n\n'Can we prove the dog ate it?” Martha asked.\n\nMort nodded solemnly. “He’s the only creature in this house capable of vanishing a meatloaf whole and leaving no trace but a tomato and the spiritual smell of gravy.” \n\n“I still think it’s Tanner,” Bríd said. “He looks... sneaky.” \n\n“I’m twelve,” Tanner replied. \n\n“Exactly.” \n\n**Final Report (Filed By Mort O’Blemish)**\n\nCrime: Disappearance of meatloaf\n\nSuspect(s): Multiple\n\nPrime Perpetrator: Canine, unrepentant\n\nEvidence: Empty dish, tomato, gastrointestinal confession\n\nNotes: Family unstable. Children may require observation. Tanner shows promise....possibly future villain.\n\nCase Status: Emotionally resolved. Logistically unresolved. Culinarily tragic.",

        "body": "\\[Stellar Care\\]\n\n\"Wow,\" Lunessa replied with a flat smile; it was her neutral expression. \"I can see why you're not in a hurry to get home.\" It was the last Friday of the school year, with the campus only open for two more days. Lunessa and Pavette fell into a conversation as they headed to class, and the subject of Summer vacation came up. The result was a list of reasons she was spending the summer with another teammate, Geonara, instead of going home. And every single reason she listed was related to her. \"People are just curse-happy on your Earth, huh?\" she asked.\n\n\"Ehhh...,\" Pavette shrugged with a non-committal vocalization. \"I can't even pretend the curses weren't deserved. My 'royal lineage' is full of self-centered asses. I'm not too worried about getting cursed again myself, but I just don't want to be around any of *them*,\" she said.\n\n\"Wait, again?\" Lunessa asked. \"You were cursed already?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" she shrugged. \"I think? Honestly, I'm not sure if it counts; I was in the womb at the time.\"\n\n\"You got cursed while your mom was still pregnant with you?\" Lunessa asked. She was interested in the conversation and intrigued by Pavette's matter-of-factness.\n\n\"Well, being turned into a swan temporarily wasn't really enough to discourage her negative behaviors,\" Pavette shook her head with a giggle. \"I think I'm supposed to be the curse, but I'm home as little as possible, so I don't know if it's working.\"\n\n\"Wait..,\" Lunessa was interested enough to stop walking and she got Pavette to stop too. \"Your parents were cursed with you? I need that explained, please,\" she said.\n\n\"From the answers I got, the gist of the curse was basically, 'may your child make their own way in the world without your help', assuming they cared about family like normal people. Joke's on the witch though, turns out my parents were fine with not having to worry about me.\"\n\n\"I dunno, you said people were cursing your family all the time, right?\" Lunessa asked.\n\n\"Yeah, there's a lot of natural magic on my Earth, curses are pretty easy.\"\n\n\"Without knowing all details, I feel like whoever did that curse probably did have an idea of what your parents were like.\"\n\n\"I thought about that,\" Pavette nodded. She wanted to let Lunessa know she wasn't completely brain-dead. \"But, the idea of a curse that doesn't actually do anything didn't make sense; it's easier to think she was stupid,\" she said.\n\n\"Did it do 'nothing'?\" Lunessa asked. \"All year, you've made it fairly apparent you're not proud of your family in the least. Maybe the 'curse' worked, and you got a chance to live your own life because of it.\" Pavette stared blankly for a moment as she reprocessed the story she'd told herself from a different angle.\n\n\"Huh,\" she finally nodded after an extended moment. \"I can't really argue that possibility, I guess..,\" she said. She was quieter now, and still obviously thinking about something as they started walking again.\n\n\"Maybe I will go home over the summer, just for a few days,\" she said as they approached the hall where they would take separate routes.\n\n\"What?\" Lunessa asked with new confusion. \"Now you want to visit them?\"\n\n\"Nah,\" Pavette shook her head. \"But, there is a nice old hag I want to visit and update on my life so far.\" \n\n\\*\\*\\* Thank you for reading! I’m responding to prompts every day. This is story #2689 in a row. (Story #150 in year eight). This story is part of an ongoing saga that takes place in my universe.",

        "body": "The Mellowood Galleria. Sounds like a quiet street where old ladies grow roses, doesn’t it? Or maybe a fancy brand of fucking cheese. Truth was, it was just another soulless cathedral built to the almighty dollar, a sprawling concrete-and-glass temple where you went to buy shit you didn’t need with money you didn’t have. And on this particular fucked-up Tuesday night, it was set to become our crypt. We just didn’t know it yet, six clueless sheep wandering into the abattoir because, hey, it sounded like a laugh. \n\n\nI’m Liam. And if this spiraling shitstorm had a designated driver, which it fucking didn’t because we were all too busy collectively soiling our underwear, I was the poor bastard who ended up gripping the wheel, mostly by default. Chloe was with me, and thank whatever unholy gods were listening for that, though watching the terror creep into her eyes like a slow-acting poison was like having my own guts twisted with a rusty pair of pliers. She’s a nursing student, Chloe, tough as a two-dollar steak when she’s dealing with ER fuckups – bikers who’ve kissed tarmac, drunks who think they can fly. But this… this was a whole different dimension of fucked.\n\n\nThen there was Sam, my asshole best friend since we were snot-nosed kids boosting comics from Henderson’s dusty old store. All swagger and cheap beer, always itching for a fight, with a tire iron under his car seat that he swore was for “emergencies.” Maya, bless her anxious soul, was a tightly wound coil of nerves even before the world decided to end; this whole mess was rapidly unraveling her. Noah, our resident tech-nerd and quiet brooder, was probably already running algorithms in his head on the precise trajectory of our impending doom. And Jess. Jess was the spark plug, always ready with a wisecrack or a stupid grin. Or she had been. Tonight, the laughter had died a quick, ugly death, strangled in her throat.\n\n\nThe plan, if you could dignify our half-assed, booze-fueled dare with such a word, was to sneak into the Galleria after it locked its doors for the night. Why? Because we were young, monumentally dumb, and Sam’s cousin knew a service door near the loading docks of Pennington’s department store that usually didn’t latch right. For about an hour, it was a fucking blast. We were like kids set loose in a candy store the size of a small town. Jess tried on a hideous diamond necklace in the darkened Zales, Sam was doing donuts on a floor polishing machine he’d somehow hotwired, and me and Chloe… well, we found a surprisingly comfortable plastic palm tree in the deserted food court. Good times. Fucking golden.\n\n\nThen the main power grid gave a tired, metallic groan and fucking died. One minute we were bathed in the artificial daylight of a thousand fluorescent tubes, the next we were plunged into a thick, suffocating blackness that felt like being buried alive. A heartbeat later, the emergency lights stuttered on, just a few of them, casting these long, dancing, skeletal shadows that turned familiar storefronts into gaping, hungry maws. The giggling stopped. The air went cold. That’s when the real party started.\n\n\nFirst came the sirens, a distant, mournful wail that rose and fell like a dying animal, getting closer, always closer. Then our phones, all six of them, shrieked in unison – that god-awful, nails-on-a-chalkboard emergency alert tone that makes you want to rip your own ears off. Fragmented bullshit scrolled across the screens: “CIVIL UNREST… UNCONFIRMED REPORTS… AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR… CITY OF MELLOWVILLE… SHELTER IN PLACE…” Useless, panicked crap. Then, one by one, the signal bars vanished. Poof. No service. No calls. No scrolling through cat videos while the world ended.\n\n\nFucking perfect.\n\n\nA thud. From somewhere deep in the mall, down by the main entrance. Heavy. Wet. Like someone dropping a side of beef onto concrete. Then another. And another, this one closer.\n\n\n“What in the unholy fuck was that?” Sam breathed, and his voice, usually a confident roar, was a thin, reedy whisper. For Sam to whisper, the sky usually had to be falling. Looked like tonight it just might be.\n\n\nThen the screaming started. Not ours, not yet. This was… this was the sound of something being torn apart while it was still alive. High-pitched, then abruptly gurgling, like someone trying to scream with a throat full of blood. It echoed through the vast, empty spaces of the Galleria, bouncing off the high, vaulted ceilings and making the hairs on my arms stand up so hard they felt like they might snap.\n\n\n“Liam?” Chloe’s hand, slick with sweat and colder than a witch’s tit, found mine in the gloom.\n\n\nBefore I could form a word, before any of us could do more than stare at each other with wide, terrified, stupid fucking eyes, the entire glass front of “The Gadget Emporium” near the main escalators didn’t just break – it fucking exploded outwards. A tsunami of jagged glass shards, glittering like a million evil diamonds in the red emergency light, rained down across the marble floor. And things, things that had once, maybe, been people, began to spill out.\n\n\nThey weren’t the fast, sprinting movie zombies. Not at first, anyway. These things shambled, they lurched, they dragged themselves with a horrible, relentless purpose. One of them, a woman, or what was left of one, still wearing the tattered remains of a mall security uniform, her face a half-eaten ruin of blood and exposed bone, fixed its milky, dead eyes on us and let out this awful, slobbering snarl. Her jaw hung crooked, and a string of something dark and glistening, like an overripe slug, dangled from her chin.\n\n\nMaya just crumpled to the floor, a thin, animal keen tearing from her throat, a sound that scraped right down my spine.\n\n\n“Run!” I yelled, my voice cracking like a goddamn choirboy’s. “Run for your fucking lives!”\n\n\nAnd run we did. Like scared rats in a collapsing maze, hearts hammering against our ribs like trapped birds, lungs burning with every ragged gasp. Behind us, the sounds of those… creatures… grew louder, a chorus of guttural roars, wet, hacking coughs, and the sickening, relentless shuffle-drag-shuffle of dead feet on polished marble. I risked a glance over my shoulder, a mistake I instantly regretted. There were more of them now, dozens, pouring from the darkened storefronts like maggots from a festering wound, drawn by the noise, by the smell of living meat. Their movements were jerky, unnatural, like poorly handled marionettes with all their strings tangled, animated by some hideous, unseen puppeteer. They weren’t people anymore. They were hunger. They were plague. They were fucking death on two legs, and they were coming for us.\n“Hammer & Home!” I screamed, the name of the hardware superstore at the ass-end of this particular wing of the mall suddenly blazing in my panic-addled brain. “Tools! We can barricade it! It’s solid!” It was a shitty plan, born of sheer, mindless terror, but it was the only goddamn plan I had.",

        "body": "It was a quiet night. Greg was sipping stale coffee, reviewing his latest draft with the smug satisfaction of a man who just wrote *“his soul was darker than the void between dying stars.”*\n\nThe lights flickered. Thunder cracked. A shadow loomed.\n\nAnd then,\n\n**“BEHOLD!”**\n\nA man in black armor stomped into Greg’s living room like a cosplay enthusiast who’d lost the plot and his dignity.\n\n“Who the hell are you?”\n\n“I am LORD NIGHTSKÜLL,” the man declared, the umlaut practically glowing. “TERROR OF THE SEVEN BLOOD REALMS. SCOURGE OF LIGHT. DESTROYER OF—”\n\nGreg held up a hand. “You’re from my book.”\n\n“Yes,” Nightsküll growled, flexing unnecessarily. “Your magnum opus. Your dark fantasy epic. Your 1.2-star Kindle exclusive.”\n\n“Hey—”\n\n“Let me speak, peasant.” He threw his cape behind his shoulder, dramatically knocking over a lamp. “You made me a joke. A walking Hot Topic clearance rack with daddy issues and no indoor voice.”\n\nGreg blinked. “You’re the villain. You’re *supposed* to be evil.”\n\n“I monologue for four pages straight while the hero literally sharpens his sword in front of me.”\n\n“You had a plan!”\n\n“I explained my entire plan to a *talking crow*. Who works for me. Why would I do that?”\n\nGreg opened his mouth, closed it.\n\n“Also,” Nightsküll growled, pulling a scroll from… somewhere unholy, “this is your description of me: *‘He stood atop the obsidian tower, black hair cascading over his angular cheekbones like a waterfall of raven’s wings, his crimson eyes glowing with the anguish of a cursed lineage.’*”\n\n“That’s not bad…”\n\n“I’m 47. I pay Home owner's association dues. Why do I look like an anime boy going through a divorce?”\n\n“Because it’s *cool*, okay?”\n\nNightsküll inhaled deeply, visibly trying not to scream. “You made my motivation ‘revenge for a prophecy that didn’t include me.’ Do you understand how stupid that sounds? That’s just a goth guy mad he wasn’t invited to prom.”\n\nGreg mumbled, “Prophecies are classic.”\n\n“So is *plumbing*, yet you gave me a fortress with lava floors and no bathrooms.”\n\nGreg stood up, defensively. “Fine! What do you want, then?”\n\n“I want *depth*,” Nightsküll hissed. “Give me nuance. Give me a reason beyond ‘He’s bad because he likes skulls.’ Maybe I garden. Maybe I volunteer at a library between blood rituals. I’m not just a villain—I’m a person.”\n\nGreg sighed. “Okay. You’ll get nuance. Layers. Less cape-flapping.”\n\n“Also.” Nightsküll grinned. “Let me win once. Just once. Not everything has to be resolved by friendship and a glowing sword of destiny.”\n\n“You killed three continents.”\n\n“Yes, but did I feel good about it? No one asks me how I’m doing!”\n\nHe stormed out, muttering about symbolism and burn ointment for “narrative injustice.”\n\nGreg looked at his laptop. Deleted : \"Chapter 17: The Crimson Reckoning of the Cursed Betrayer Prince (Part 1 of 3)\"\n\nHe started typing....\n\nChapter One: Nightsküll Attends Therapy",

It's cold 24/7 there! \n\nThe second sign that something isn't quite right are the mortals in blue uniform, who look at you funny and bite back laughter. They are polite, as Canadians are, but two of them burst out laughing as soon as they think you're out of earshot. You feel just a little concerned as they radio for someone to follow you around, lest you \"hurt yourself\".\n\nAs if! You are a Wizarding Student from the swampy depths of Florida! You have fought magical alligators and escaped with your life! You march right through the terminal of the airport, ignoring the fact that everyone around you is staring right at you! Have they never met an American wizard who prepared to go overseas? \n\nYou realize your mistake as soon as you step out of the airport's air conditioned hall. The smog, the honking drivers, the heat! It's like you never left home at all! What sorcery is this? \n\nYou spin, extending a accusatory finger at the puzzled man in blue behind you. You make it two steps before your overheated brain blacks out, and you eat the concrete curb. \n\nYou wake up several days later. Your new classmates stand over you. They explain your mistakes and complain that it took days to remove every mortal memory of your spectacular entry to one of the busiest airports on the continent. They also inform you that your medical bill is free.\n\nBut the cost to erase the memories of all those mortals? Hooo boy. \"Elective procedures\" are not covered under Canadian Wizarding Law. Better hope your travel insurance covers it. \n\nBut you hail from the swamps of Florida. You know it doesn't. You are doomed.",

He had felled necromancers, hunted world serpents, and deposed hundreds of tyrannical rulers in his time. It was said that his swordsmanship surpassed that of Glidon the Warrior-God. He could block every drop of rain in the sky with his shield, and with a single arrow, he could pin an ant to the ground without killing it. None knew where his impossible skills stemmed from, but people said they never saw him sleeping or eating. If he was not on some heroic quest, he was training. Lifting mountains on his shoulders, one boulder at a time. Creating tsunamis by leg pressing the ocean. \n\n   Some said he would never die. There were never any signs of age, only more wisdom and experience added to his incalculably swift brain. He never sustained an injury. He never flinched, never balked, was never surprised or worried. It was said that in a battle, the Nameless could only ever be defeated if one predicted his movements, his speed was so stunning and impossible.\n\n   All of that changed the day he faced Dalivan the Dimwit in single combat. A man of legendary strength and skill, The Nameless Champion took this opponent as seriously as he would any other, despite Dalivan being notoriously slow and dull. \n\n   As the combat began, The Champion made the one move that he knew could not be countered, could not be blocked - in the blink of an eye, he moved to where Dalivan was standing, swapped to his position, and moved to strike, figuring that no man would cut at himself. \n\n   Unfortunately, Dalivan dropped his sword on his own head upon unsheathing it. Thus ended the legacy of the Nameless Champion.",

Stupidity, on the other hand, that is very hard” John peered over the top of his glasses pointedly at me.\n\nI smirk and “*accidently*” lean against an ugly, and therefore, expensive looking vase, making it topple dangerously. It had the desired effect, he yelped, jumping up, diving to save it.\n\n“That is a Sevres-style porcelain vase- be careful!” he shrieked. I shrugged, walking past him and made myself comfortable on the sofa. \n\n“I want the warrant by tomorrow, John. Garret is going to move fast if he knows we are on his tail”\n\nJohn whipped around at me straightening his uniform, scowling, “You do realize that *I* am your Chief and you don’t make demands of me?”\n\n“I’m not making demands- I’m begging you” I said, flashing a winning smile as I put my feet up on his polished table.\n\nJohn let out an exasperated sigh, and sat across from me, shoving my feet unceremoniously off the table. He took a deep breath and like he was preparing for a verbal emesis of his usual greatest hits: Warnings That Ruth Will Ignore.\n\n“For the last time, Ruth, let him be. He is above your pay grade.” He started in a low, serious voice that always made me zone out. “You are just small fry to him. You just got your detective badge a year ago. He’s the head of the most powerful and wealthiest crime family in the country and he practically rules this city. He is untouchable, he has got more government officials in pocket than-”\n\nAh, there it was.\n\nGarret Langford. The man of my dreams.\n\nSpecifically, the ones in which I cuff him and watch him rot in jail for the rest of his miserable life. He was just lowly criminal who had started fancying himself the next Godfather or something. An orphan that became the heir to Victor Rusakov, the Russian drug lord with a disturbing obsession with his own image. Rumor has it, Victor had carved a hundred sculptures of himself. All butt-naked. Turns out money can buy a lot of things, but not good taste. Or a desire to wear pants.\n\nWhile Victor was wildly successful in setting up his drug empire, he had not expanded much, (presumably preoccupied by his marble-based legacy), but his successor, Garret, had evidently successfully curbed any artistic leanings he might have inherited, and made his adopted Papa proud. He had his finger in every pie- drugs, weapons, scams, smuggling, and for all I knew, illegal ostrich racing too. He was a rat. But worse- a well-connected one. He’d greased so many palms in high places that charges slid off him like slime even before they get written up.\n\n On paper, he was positively cherubic- he made donations, and helped the poor, opened schools and kissed babies. It was so beautiful, I almost sobbed.\n\nExcept the schools were probably fronts for money laundering, the poor were paid actors.\n\nHe was good at hiding behind this charming, if thin, façade of humanity. Maybe he thought himself untouchable. But he’s overlooked something rather important in his continued gallivanting through a life of criminal accomplishments with nary a thought to stop him: me. I’m going to knock the king off of his throne of blood and sin. ",

Wherever I go, it rapidly becomes the most interesting place to live in the entire world. They call me The Lightning Rod. Not because I can do anything with actual lightning, or anything actually cool and enjoyable to use. No, I am called The Lightning Rod because trouble is attracted to me. People looking to make a mess, cause chaos, act on vendettas, or any other potentially dangerousgoal, find themselves drawn to my vicinity.\n\nThe biggest concentration of super powered individuals is centered on me. I didn't ask for it, I did not seek to create this state of affairs. Once my power became known and understood, some people with thinking powers got together and helped pick the best spot with the resources to handle the metaphorical hurricane that follows me where I go. Even people who aren't looking to make a mess are drawn, simply because of the incredible concentration of superpowers in the area.\n\nThe best heroes in the world watch me, along with half of the most powerful villains. The more belligerent an individual, the stronger the attraction. People with the stated desire of conquering and/or destroying the world pop up around me on a monthly basis. I hear explosions and monologuing megalomaniacs every day.\n\nThe only thing I like about it is that it has led to me meeting many exceptional people. Good souls with incredible drives and altruistic motivations. We may have begun as simple colleagues, but now I feel fortunate to call many of them my friends. \n\nAs much as I hate it, I know my continued existence makes the world a better place. Even if I could turn it off, I would not. I don't stop every tragedy or calamity from happening around the world, but that statistics do not lie. I have saved more lives than any other superhero. Instead of chaos and violence happening elsewhere, it happens here, where we have the resources to handle it. So I muddle through, and hope my friends are good enough at their jobs that I will live to see another day.",

        "body": "**CLASSIFIED -- EYES ONLY**\n\n**OPERATION: VULCAN'S ANVIL**\n\n**TO:** Director, Central Intelligence Agency\n\n**FROM:** Special Operations Group, Domestic Intelligence Division\n\n**DATE:** November 15, 1966\n\n**SUBJECT:** Initial Assessment -- Anomalous Human Capabilities (AHC) -- Negro Communities\n\n**REFERENCE:** DI/SOG-66-001, \"Emergent Threat Matrix: Domestic\"\n\n---\n\n**SECTION I: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**\n\nIntelligence gathered over the past eighteen (18) months indicates a disturbing, statistically anomalous emergence of advanced human capabilities (hereafter, AHCs) manifesting exclusively within the Negro American population. Initial data suggests no common genetic marker or environmental trigger, though every confirmed instance is tied to individuals deeply embedded within or sympathetically aligned with various civil rights and burgeoning Black Power movements. The phenomenon represents a significant escalation of domestic security threats, possessing the potential to fundamentally alter the socio-political landscape of the United States. Our preliminary assessment categorizes this development as an existential challenge to established order and racial hierarchy. Countermeasures are immediately required to destabilize, discredit, and ultimately neutralize these emergent capabilities and their associated influence.\n\n---\n\n**SECTION II: PHENOMENA AND DOCUMENTATION --CASE STUDIES**\n\nThe initial reports were dismissed as folklore, hysteria, or deliberate agitprop. Field agents, trained to recognize ideological subversion, struggled to categorize phenomena that defied conventional explanation. Yet, the persistent whispers, the sudden, inexplicable shifts in local power dynamics within historically disenfranchised communities, demanded a re-evaluation. It began subtle, like the slow bloom of a moonflower in the humid Southern night, too quiet to be alarming, yet too definite to ignore.\n\n**CASE FILE AHC-PHI-001: “The Deaconess of the Dew”**\n\n*   **Subject:** Elara Mae Johnson, b. 1903. Resides: North Philadelphia, PA. Affiliation: Community matriarch, informal spiritual advisor.\n\n*   **Reported AHC:** Empathic amplification and localized atmospheric manipulation.\n\nThe first credible reports filtered from the urban sprawl of Philadelphia. Not from some fiery street orator or some slick-tongued organizer, but from an old woman, eighty-some years of age, whose hands were gnarled like winter oak roots. Elara Mae Johnson. Folks called her “Deaconess,” not for any church title, but because she carried herself with the weight of the spirit, deep and true, like the bottom of a sweet water well. She lived on a block where the row houses leaned tired against one another, their brick faces chipped like old teeth. The street, a mosaic of broken glass and worn-out dreams, usually hummed with the mean-tempered buzz of desperation.\n\nAgent Miller, a new recruit with more book-smarts than street-sense, noted in his initial dispatch: \"Subject Johnson exhibits an uncanny calming effect on agitated crowds. Observed multiple instances where racial tensions, at near-riot levels, dissipated in her immediate vicinity. Attributed initially to her 'reputation' and 'moral authority.'\"\n\nBut then the reports got stranger. A late summer evening, the air thick with the promise of violence after a police altercation -- the air itself, witnesses claimed, seemed to *shift* around Elara Mae. Not wind, not a draft, but a hush that felt like a hand laid on the heart. The street lamps, usually a sickly yellow, took on a soft, pulsing glow, and the concrete underfoot cooled, as if a gentle rain had just fallen, though the sky was clear. Folks said it was like the very air was breathing with her, exhaling peace when she spoke, drawing in the rage and holding it.\n\nA Negro woman, identified as Clementine “Clemmie” Lewis, later interrogated, described it thusly: \"Sister Elara Mae, she just stood there, her face a road map of every sorrow and every joy, and she just *felt* it all. Felt the hurt and the anger. And then, it was like she took it in, drank it down like bitter medicine, and breathed out something cool, something that smelled like fresh earth after a long rain. Folks just... *stopped*. The noise in their heads quieted. They weren't singing praises, no. Just... *still*. Like the eye of a hurricane, quiet and awful.\"\n\nOur analysis indicates Subject Johnson possesses the ability to absorb and redirect ambient emotional energy, specifically fear and aggression, converting it into a palpable, localized field of tranquility. Furthermore, there is credible evidence of minor atmospheric manipulation -- localized temperature drops, subtle atmospheric pressure changes -- facilitating this calming effect. The 'Dew' in her moniker is not merely poetic; our sensors detected trace moisture deposition in her immediate sphere of influence during high-stress incidents. This ability, while outwardly benign, is profoundly disruptive to our efforts to sow discord and exploit existing racial tensions. A community rendered emotionally impervious to agitators is a community that defies predictable manipulation.\n\n**CASE FILE AHC-NYC-007: “The Concrete Prophet”**\n\n*   **Subject:** Malachi \"Kai\" Jones, b. 1942. Resides: Harlem, NY. Affiliation: Suspected member, radical Negro nationalist group (conflicting reports regarding \"Brotherhood of Ascendant Light\").\n\n*   **Reported AHC:** Geokinetic manifestation and enhanced physical resilience.\n\nIn the concrete canyons of Harlem, where the shadows of tenements stretch long and lean across the bustling streets, another type of fire began to burn. Malachi(kai) Jones was a young man, sharp-eyed, with a coiled spring in his step and a voice like gravel over thunder. He didn't preach peace or calm souls; he spoke of reckoning and justice, loud and clear, with no apology in his heart. His mother was a laundress who prayed for him nightly, his father a Pullman porter who had seen too much. Malachi saw things differently. He saw the city as a living, breathing thing, and he understood its bones.\n\nThe first reports on Kai Jones were simply that he was \"unusually persuasive\" at rallies, \"resistant to arrest,\" and \"unaccountably strong.\" A brawl broke out near a recruitment drive for a radical group -- a common occurrence, usually leading to arrests and dispersal. But this time, multiple NYPD officers reported Jones \"moving with unnatural speed\" and \"resisting takedowns with impossible leverage.\" One officer, patrolman O’Malley, recounted: \"He just... *stood there*. Took three of us, and he didn't even sway. His feet, they looked like they'd grown roots right into the asphalt. Then, when we went for the cuffs, the damn *street* buckled. Like an earthquake, just for a second. We fell like dominoes, and he was gone.\"\n\nFurther surveillance revealed more direct manifestations. During a heated protest march, a police barricade, hastily constructed from concrete barriers, collapsed under unexplained localized tremors. Jones was observed at the front of the march, his fists clenched, his face a mask of furious determination, and the very ground beneath his feet seemed to shiver with his indignation. We have documented multiple instances of localized seismic events, often correlated with Subject Jones's heightened emotional states. These tremors, while brief, are sufficient to destabilize structures, disrupt law enforcement formations, and induce mass panic. His physical resilience, coupled with his ability to manipulate the earth beneath him, makes traditional crowd control tactics highly ineffective. He embodies the very spirit of urban resistance -- the city itself rising to meet him.\n\n**CASE FILE AHC-CHI-004: “The Ghetto Oracle”**\n\n*   **Subject:** Isaiah \"Sight\" Washington, b. 1938. Resides: South Side Chicago, IL. Affiliation: Unconfirmed connections to Nation of Islam cells and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) chapter.\n\n*   **Reported AHC:** Precognitive visions and amplified persuasive rhetoric.\n\nChicago's South Side, a labyrinth of bustling markets, smoke-filled jazz clubs, and tenements where hope often went to die, birthed another kind of power. Isaiah Washington was a quiet man, a former postal worker, who moved through the world like a shadow, unnoticed until he spoke. And when he spoke, folks listened, because his words carried the weight of tomorrow's truth. They called him \"Sight\" because he seemed to see beyond the veil, into the coming troubles.\n\nOur initial files on Washington noted an unusual success rate in organizing boycotts and predicting police raids. \"Subject Washington appears to possess an uncanny ability to anticipate law enforcement movements and societal shifts,\" one report dryly stated. But it was more than just good intelligence or street smarts. It was a knowing that went deeper, like a well spring bubbling up from hidden places.\n\nAn undercover operative, designated Agent \"Cardinal,\" infiltrated a community meeting where Washington was speaking. Cardinal reported: \"He didn't yell or wave his arms. Just stood there, calm as a lake at dawn, and talked about what was coming. Said the market on Tuesday would be empty, because the 'Spirit of Resistance' would call people to stay home. Said the raid on the community center would happen Thursday at 3 AM, and folks should move their sensitive materials. And damned if it didn't happen, just like he said. Not just the boycott, but the raid too. He described the squad cars, the uniforms, the exact time. It wasn't guesswork. It was... *seeing*.\"",

        "body": "The nights were quiet around Ashwood Grove.\n\nIt was just about as far into the middle of the woods as one could get without being completely off the map. Yes, the houses had electricity and plumbing, and yes, the children grew up with phones and laptops and the like. But the homes were built by their inhabitants, the animals were raised and bred through generations, and the villagers were taught to fend for themselves. The only public services were a small fire station manned by less than a dozen individuals at any given time and a clinic that only had the equipment for non-emergencies. Any truly dangerous situations would require backup from one of the larger cities half an hour down the road.\n\nI grew up here in the aspens and birches. I knew the name and face of every single person, memorized every street and business, could identify every inch of my idyllic little slice of Earth. \n\nAnd though it was isolated, it was home.\n\nBut Ashwood Grove kept a secret, one that seldom wormed its way out of the minds of the locals. A secret only told in hushed whispers--that of the Pale Widow.\n\nMothers warned children that if they did not eat their brussels, the Widow would smash their window in and whisk them away into the night. Teenagers sometimes dared each other to go into the woods, and, occasionally, one group would return in fewer numbers than when they had gone in, eyes wide and skin just as pale as the Widow that had somehow stolen away their friend. None of them, not the firefighters who brandished great axes or the hunters who could nail a deer in the skull from a kilometer away dared to stay in the woods overnight.\n\nNone of them but Old Man Bob.\n\nI knew Old Man Bob pretty well. My Pops died of pancreatic cancer when I was a tot, so on the way home from school, I sometimes dropped by Old Man Bob's house. Courteous, gentlemanly, and with the air of elders who had their rough edges smoothed out from the long years, Bob always offered me a little sweet or a funny story to tide me over during the harsh winters. He wasn't exactly notable in the town, since he usually kept to himself, but sometimes he would invite my friends and I to play in his yard, where there were animals galore to chase after and feed. He didn't have a job--he was far too old to work--but he hadn't gone senile either. I played him in Chess, sometimes, and he would always beat me in ways I would never expect.\n\nAnd one day, he went out camping.\n\nNobody really knew until he came back the day after, whistling a jaunty tune while rocking on his porch's chair. \n\n\"Damn fine place this is,\" he said when I asked him about it. \"Don't know why you youngin's are too chicken to pop out every once in a while. Fish's aplenty, shrooms are in season, the whole lot.\"\n\n\"But what about the Pale Widow?\" I asked.\n\n\"Pshhh, that old wives' tale?\" Old Man Bob chuckled in that dismissive way of the ancient. \"Is just a boogeyman to keep the kiddos from traipsin' off into Timbuktu.\"\n\nThe numerous missing persons report would beg to differ. Old Man Bob read the news every morning, but he always dismissed it as stupid kids being stupid kids, digging themselves a pit they couldn't escape.\n\n\"Ya just gotta have the know-how to not spook a moose or a bear, or pick out the right kind of shroom while watchin' out for vipers,\" Old Man Bob said.",

Mayor Johnson's body shivered at the sound, eyeing his blessedly quiet home where his wife and children slept. Early slumber was custom in Fortingale. Nightlife was nonexistent - residents were referred to by neighbors in the region as \"the early risers\". It wasn't said in judgement. Who would want to share the night with a specter?\n\nStill, he felt responsible. This town was all he ever knew, every road a path carved in the lines of his face over the two decades of loyal guardianship. He prided himself on these nights most, braving a look into the darkness as *She* passed. Ensuring nobody was harmed, and knowing first when someone inevitably was. The helplessness never quite consumed him to the point of fruitless confrontation.\n\nChildren were warned away of their natural curiosities. \"Do not watch her walk,\" parents would scold, \"she will lead you to your death.\" The few who couldn't be contained by the potential of danger or at least chagrin, well... they served as dire enough warnings. Drained husks dumped at a riverbank, where the strictest parents would drag their living children come morning to hammer in the truth. His own parents could be counted in that crowd.\n\nShe was a \"legend\" only to those who hadn't been here long enough to know better.\n\nTonight was different though, and for the first time since he could possibly recall, he and a handful of townsfolk will not only watch the glide of The Pale Widow. They will, in fact, follow.\n\nIt would never have been attempted before. Generation after generation would be warned against it, told that all was peaceful so long as nobody roamed at nightfall. Whenever a determined resident or foolhardy rumor-chaser wouldn't heed them, they paid with their life.\n\nThat was before Bob Dennings Jr. arrived in Fortingale. A handsome enough trader and drunk with a slight belly to match, he found himself stumbling out of the Benmouth Square Inn at nightfall. His hosts watched in horror, urging him through barely cracked doors and windows to return. He simply grunted at them as he walked to and fro, joyful under the moonlight.\n\nAs the innkeeper tells it, The Pale Widow floated from around the corner as she always does. Her skeletal body glowing as if bathed in moonlight, dressed in the tatters of a black mourning dress, eyes empty and hollow when they peered through her mourning veil, her mouth tightly pressed. She was beautiful in the way a cougar was a regal vision in its prowl.\n\nToo close for any resident's comfort, they sent a prayer and expected to witness one of the most public brutal slaughters of their resident terror in recent memory.\n\nOnly, she paused.",

It was as if years on the wrong side of law and morals carved into his flesh, and he was all hard edges even where things ought to be soft. His eyes were dark, a brooding, feverish stare fixed on the flames between them like a man considering a god he had to begrudgingly respect. His thin lips were pursed in stubborn silence, dark hair falling limply into his eyes. He didn't seem to care. When did he, really? \n\n\"Are you going to keep up the silent treatment?\"\n\nHis eyes didn't even flick up. The *yes* was implied in its own absence.\n\n\"Suit yourself. You're probably a lesser threat without that weapon engaged.\" I gestured at his set mouth with the stick I was holding, the meat skewered on top crackling as I put it back into the flames. I was convinced I will always smell of smoke and cooked prey, even if I could finally abandon life on the road.\n\n\"You have one purpose here.\" His voice rumbled. It would have been soothing had he not been such a genuine menace.\n\n\"Correct. And you have one purpose *always*. Both of which can be accomplished sans brutal silence.\"\n\nHe didn't crack a smile, didn't chuckle. Merely tore into his undercooked meat and let the juices drip down into his beard. It was unsettling, how subdued he could be when not attempting to con his way to vengeance, fluid movements and even more fluid words contained as if by force of magic. \n\n*Fine by me, you joyless schmuck*. I tried to remind myself that I could always walk away from our reluctant collaboration, but then, the fact I didn't want to should have told me everything I needed to know. \"Have you ever thought about what you're going to do after you're done?\"\n\nHe finally looked up, tossing his now barren stick into the fire. \"What do you mean?\"",

        "body": "Rules exist for a reason among both sides. For years, there had been a silent arrangement amongst heroes and villains. You don't unmask the other side without a proper fight, you keep fights away from parks and schools, and most importantly, you don't fuck with family.\n\n When The Fae recruited her, that was the first lesson drilled into Achlys head. She didn't understand it, not at first, they were villains after all. But then came Puppet, and Charm, Fae's two daughters. Two small girls who Achlys started to see not just as future comrades, but almost like nieces. Growing up in a home where she never felt the warmth of a family, the protective feeling was strange yet eye opening for her. she hated the idea of anything happening to those girls and suddenly the rules made a lot more sense.\n\n Over the years, Achlys grew. She had started as a young vengeful villain, and while yes, in ways she still was, she grew outside of that villainous persona. She didn't need to be Achlys all the time, but she didn't need to go back to who she once was either. On her fifteenth birthday, Ari was born, and her old name died. She had a nice civilian job during the day when Fae didn't need her, working in one of the red headed woman's many businesses, a Cafe called \"The Grove\". A certain raven haired girl worked there too.\n\n Sasha was funny, confident in ways Ari still struggled to be. A year older then Ari, she was an inspiration to her. It only took a month for the two to start flirting, by the second month, they were planning their first date. Late night walks and picnic in the parks, it was a relationship Ari could only dream about, almost perfect, except for the fact that Sasha was a heroes fan girl. It was hard hearing the love of her life praise one of the very same people who had stopped her from stealing a very pretty ring the night before. Her ribs still hurt a bit from that damn tin man punching her. \n\n \"- no. I'm not going to call him that Sasha, it's a dumb name!\" Ari huffed, wiping down the counter as the news talked about last night's jewelry store incident. \n\n \"It is not! Iron Guy is an amazing hero name, right dad?!\" Sasha looked over at a man who nodded in agreement, sipping his coffee. Black, no cream, no sugar. Disgusting in Ari's opinion but Sasha thought the same about the supposed sugar monstrosity of her preferred coffee.\n\nShe crossed her arms \"First off, he it totally just ripping off Iron man's name and I hope marvel sues him! He should be more original with his name instead of stealing from a comic book. Secondly, you're dad looks like he would cosplay that tin jerk so no, his opinion is invalid.\"\n\n Ari wasn't lying, the man, Corey, had the exact build, speech patterns, eyes, and even hair style as the hero. She just fails to notice how both her girlfriend and Corey freeze up at that statement.\n\nCorey sets down his coffee at that \"You just hate him cause you cosplay Achlys in your spare time. My daughter told me all about your costume.\" He grumbles, watching how Ari tensed slightly at his words before rolling her eyes. The costume in question was actually a prototype that Ari had to abandon due to Sasha seeing it. \n\nThe clock buzzed just as the cafe doors open, Ella 'Fae' walking in with a smile, dismissing both girls who hurry off on their next shared adventure.\n\n\"Ari is right. It is a dumb name.\" The red head mused as Corey stood.\n\n\"... Fae. You owe me for not exposing your identity to the public,\" he starts, voice cold. \"Achlys and Ari are the same person, aren't they.\" A small smile forms on Ella's face when she nods, especially at the anger that grows on his face.\n\n\"I have to admit, them dating wasn't part of my plan but it sure is great.\" The woman grins \"Oh, and Sasha asked Ari out. You're daughter technically is the one who messed with family first.\"\n\n(Haven't written from a plot in a while, but any excuse to procrastinate world building right now is awesome-)",

He always insisted he was a danger to society, and he would one day bring the world to a \"sticky end\".\n\nNeedless to say, this made him the butt of many jokes. It did not need to be said that serious superhero teams like the Council of Altruists, the Enclave of Europe's Powered People or the Asian Anti-Crime Alliance never took him seriously.\n\nNot just that, vigilantes mocked him ruthlessly too. When a major sewage overflow hit Manhattan, the vigilante Bill \"The Orphan\" Wayne quipped, \"Must be Slurry's first serious attempt at world domination!\"\n\nEven supervillains didn't think much of Slurry at all. He got no offers of collaboration. He was never invited to their secret meetings.\n\nIt was all very frustrating to Slurry, so he decided that to make his first real mark on the world in general, he would have to do something unprecedented.\n\nThat was to trouble the kin of a superhero.\n\nFor his target, Slurry chose 9-year-old Regis Archambeau, the younger brother of Aurelie \"Shieldmaiden\" Archambeau, who was a member of the Council of Altruists.\n\nHis video of little Regis struggling in a chest-deep vat of purplish muck was released on most video streaming sites, including YouTube, and racked up millions of views in mere minutes.\n\nHowever, to Slurry's shock, he was BOMBARDED by messages threatening him and demanding him to take down the video and release Regis - FROM FELLOW VILLAINS.\n\n\"RELEASE REGIS, YOU MORON! YOU WANT TO GET US ALL KILLED?!\"\n\n\"If you don't let that boy go this instant, I'll break into your lair - and I'll release him myself!\"\n\n\"You bloody (long chain of profound expletives), you REALLY have no idea of what you're getting into, do you?!\"\n\nThe warnings were too late, though.\n\nSlurry was beaten literally senseless by an absolutely FURIOUS Joram \"Zapperilla\" the silverback gorilla member of the Council, who was Aurelie's best friend.\n\nThe force that came to save Regis arrived in record time - a mere 41 minutes after the release of the video displaying his capture.\n\nIt included ALL superhero teams in the world, the Council's official allies, vigilantes, police forces, military teams, some countries' special operation teams, the supervillain Infinight, and even two teams of friendly alien agents - the Keityn and Gar-Zar.\n\nSlurry, until today, remains unconscious from the savagery unleashed on him by Joram. Not that he would have anything to look forward to when he awakens. There's a minimum 5 year solitary confinement sentence, and that's just the first mandatory sentence.",

        "body": "**Clean Up Crew**\n\nThe bodycount of most supervillains is astonishingly low. An upstart minion with delusions of grandeur who stabbed them in the back, an even more evil version of themselves from an alternate dimension, or an alien conquerer come to “usurp their rightful place as ruler of Earth.” are some of the usual kills. Some of the S-Tier villains have manage zero deaths, either out of principle or because they know the fun ends when they start stacking bodies.\n\nBecause there are rules to the Super Power game, and “No Killing” is one of them. As long as the villains abide by the rules, the everybody goes home at the end of the day whether that’s to a secret volcano lair, a prison cell, or to friends and family. That’s another rule that both supes and villains abide by; as long as family and friends are by-standers instead of active participants they get left alone. If “No Killing” is a rule clad in Iron, “Family is off-limits” is clad in Titanium.\n\nBut sometimes a psychopath with an edgy costume or an evil doppelgänger from the mirror universe decides to up the ante and break those rules, that’s when our department gets called.  Before the Symbol of Peace decides that he needs to protect the world with a dictatorship or the Smartest Woman in Earth decides to change history with a time machine, we step in. \n\nA team of working and retired heroes, civilians, ex-military, and even reformed villains. Before the supes (and the occasional villain) find out about their loved ones, we clean up any evidence of foul play and stage “normal” deaths. That way they can grieve and move on instead of causing a multiversal crisis. \n\nUnfortunately we were on the clock today.\n\nThe brother of a supe called Lady Lighting (an up and coming C-Class heroine with command of lightning and thunder) was found in his murdered in his apartment. He was poisoned and his body set up in a tableau clearly meant to lure the potential A-lister into a game of cat and mouse. The team cleaned up any evidence of an intruder, and set the poor man up in bed to play part of the too-young victim of a heart attack.\n\nNext was my job: “taking care of” the Rulebreaker. The clues they left for Lady Lightning were not subtle. They planned to hijack a ferry, set up catch-22 situation with hostages where Lady Lightning couldn’t save everyone while the Rulebreaker escaped. I got to the terminal before them, then hid in the shadows and watched them enter the dock near dawn.\n\nA psych-profile pointed to a villain unrelated to the supe, someone who hoped to make a name for themselves and the costume they wore confirmed it. Instead of a themed outfit matching or mirroring their chosen rival they looked like the fell out of a Hot Topic and into the dumpster behind a BDSM store. All black, spikes, and straps with no sense of symmetry and style. Their villaincraft was poor too, not a making a grand entrance nor unseen stealth as they approached the ferry with nefarious devices in hand.\n\nCriticisms aside, I had a job to do. Few would have heard me approach, but with the Rulebreaker’s lack of attention on their surroundings I barely needed it. I slid behind them as they started a monolog to themselves about “breaking the spirit of so-called heroes”, and with a sickening crack I twisted their neck with my super strength and had their head facing the wrong direction. They wore a mask that looked like it came from a discount Halloween store but I was thankful I didn’t have to see their dead eyes, regardless of how evil the bastard was.\n\nI hefted their body over my shoulder and exited towards my driver and their car. I loaded the villain’s corpse in the trunk. The last part of the team’s job was dealing with the rule breaker’s life, making alibis for their death and dealing with whatever nastiness they might have left in their lair before someone finds their way in just to die at the hands of a nuclear powered robot or explosive boobytrap.\n\nI signaled for my driver to go. She gave me a nod before leaving; she knew I liked to be alone after my job was done and I was grateful she accommodated me. I began my walk to a place where I could clear my head. This morning’s job was a long way from the cemetery, it would be after lunchtime when I got there. I stopped by an asian market on the way, grabbing beer and tuna-mayo onigiri; I don’t care for it but it was his favorite.\n\nI stood in front of my brother’s gravestone, sweating in the long coat covering my super suit. I spoke to him about the same things I usually do after a job: I fill him in on the details, joke about the super villain’s ridiculous costume (as if all super suits aren’t a little silly), and wish I had told him I was a superhero so he could have been prepared for when my nemesis broke into his house and murdered him to get back at me. After a good cry I ate the onigiri and drank the now warm beer in silence, then told him I loved him and said with a wry smile I hoped I didn’t see him again too soon.\n\nIt’s not a pretty job, what we do. But I think we do make things better. Supes often carry enough guilt and shame for the lives we can’t save. The team spares them another burden, the idea that if only they had never donned the cape, never stepped up to keep people safe, then their loved ones would be alive. So I’ll carry the burden of the lives I take to keep them going, to keep them saving the world and the people in it. For myself and for the memory of my brother.\n\nEdited to fix some typos and clear up some language.",

Some follow the rule because they believe it would be too easy, too cheap, and some follow it because they fear waking up to a knife at their throat. Or worse.\n\nSo Lord Villanueva was naturally shocked when he was awoken by his security alarm blaring at around midnight. He quickly sprang up out of and began putting on his suit and cape.\n\nMinutes later, he was in his throne room, and two minions had brought before him one of his enemies, Adrian the Underdog. \n\nVillanueva was confused the moment he laid eyes on Adrian. He didn't seem to be struggling when he was dragged in, didn't make any moves when released, and he wasn't wearing his uniform. Instead, he was wearing a tank top, tight shorts with no pockets, and cheap flip-flops. And looking at his face... had he been crying?\n\n\"He didn't have any weapons or equipment on him, my lord.\" One of the minions spoke. That seemed obvious enough. Although Adrian had crafted plenty of low-profile devices in the past, there truly seemed to be nowhere he could hide anything if he wanted to.\n\nVillanueva maintained his composure, and spoke in his deep, commanding tone. \"What is the meaning of this, Underdog? Did you honestly think breaking in while I slept would be any easier than when I was awake?\"\n\nAdrian stood, looking at the ground, not speaking.\n\n\"Well? Speak!\"\n\nThen, slowly, hesitantly, as if the action were causing him great pain, Adrian lowered himself to his hands and knees before his enemy. \"Please, Lord Villanueva...\" Adrian choked out. \"Vilestalker has my wife and daughter...\"\n\nThat was another unspoken rule. You do not threaten your enemy's innocent family. Villanueva had never even considered such a thing.\n\nAdrian continued. \"Please, I... I don't know who else I can turn to...\"\n\nVilestalker was a somewhat new villain on the scene. It had seemed to Villanueva, and others he had spoken with, that Vilestalker was becoming increasingly desperate in his pursuit of fear and respect, his plans always escalating in damage and scale. Perhaps he should've seen this coming...\n\n\"To think he would take such action... Rise, Adrian.\" Adrian rose to his feet, searching Villanueva's face for hints of his thoughts, and found quiet rage. \"Innocent people and children have no place in our battles. Will you swear with me that we shall put aside our rivalry until this matter is dealt with?\"\n\n\"I swear.\" Adrian said without hesitation.\n\n\"I swear it as well, and that I shall see to it personally your family is safely returned to you.\"\n\nAnd the two shook hands.",

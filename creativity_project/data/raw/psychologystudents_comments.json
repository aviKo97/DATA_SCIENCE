My only other thought is when I read a paper if I can’t remember what this specific analysis is all about I pull up my notes from my stats courses in grad school or I do some major googling. I think keeping up with the literature and reminding yourself of those things consistently helps you stay on top of it. Not sure if you’re planning to attend grad school but they’ll also have their own stats courses and/or research methods courses for you to help you brush up. A solid lab where you might try to get RA experience will expect you to have some knowledge but can help you brush up too. The RAs in our lab go through weekly R sessions practicing various analyses and also meet with the lab manager frequently to check on their analyses or ask questions. I think my main point it that it’s ok I don’t think anyone expects you to remember everything from your one stats class in undergrad. You can do some of these more formal things mentioned here or just gradually review different studies and brush up on specific analyses as you read literature that way you have the knowledge at least on what tests are helpful for what you’re looking at. I think that’s the more important thing SPSS is user friendly and you can easily google a YouTube video on how to run a specific test. But the knowledge on the why, where, when for each test/analysis is the more immediate issue I imagine.",

We have Autistic friends who come to our house regularly to play. She has been taught since she was 2 years old on how to play with and include these children with a range of needs.  It is a lot easier to teach her how to be inclusive, rather than teach these children to behave in a way that is (arbitrarily) 'appropriate'.

I like how big tasks like going to the restroom, doing laundry are broken down into mini steps. \nMy son enjoyed therapists that connected with him. He absolutely rebelled against therapists that tried to control or over power him. One therapist made him play outside on his new swing but my son wanted to be inside. It was after school when he needed a bit of freedom to release the days stress. So, after three attempts to make him stay out, my son punched the lady. He wanted to relax not be forced to play outside.\nThe therapist’s that connected taught my level 3 son to use the toilet & wash his hands, get ready for school, eat dinner without throwing the plate or all items. \nIt’s really important to be the manager and speak up if a therapist is not helping. We had one that insisted things had to be his way only. My son got mad and blew a hole through our wall. We could feel his tention rising but the therapist kept pushing him. My husband and that arrogant therapist (higher up manager) got into a heated argument. We also had one that taught our son to open doors which made it difficult to keep him from eloping.\nThe ones that I loved went on walks with us, sat with my son and colored, helped with communication. Structured time and a clear plan of goals is helpful. Treating the patient like a person and not a subject it vital.",

        "body": "TLDR: I think it can be great, but it’s definitely not for everyone, and you shouldn’t work in it or put your kid in it without acknowledging its problematic history, nor without looking into the procedures any clinic you are considering uses. \n\nI worked as an RBT with kids (ages 2 - 10) who had autism for a while. I think overall it’s a solid approach to helping kids with autism prepare for schools, learn healthier ways of expressing emotions, learn to attend to social cues and more. But it is difficult to do effectively and ethically. An ABA clinic that relies heavily on punishment and insists kids NEED to be there 40 hours a week is just unethical. (Punishment becomes a more nuanced discussion when you’re talking about kids who engage in severe self-injurious behavior of course… but that’s a whole can of worms) At the clinic I worked at, we never used punishment, and even in kids that were only in the clinic for like 10-20 hours a week saw marked improvement over enough time. We *would* use restraining positions though, but only for clients who we knew would injure themselves during escalations. I really didn’t like this - I understood the necessity of it but it still felt wrong. One of the many reasons i left. \n\nABA has a pretty bad history (Ivar Lovaas, a researcher who spearheaded modern ABA, also tried to use behaviorism as conversion therapy in LGBT/gender non-conforming kids, and that should say enough) and many adults with autism who went to ABA treatment as a kid have genuinely traumatic memories associated with it. Who can blame them? But, many modern clinics are VERY aware of this and are making fantastic changes to make the treatment ABA offers actually *therapeutic.* ",

        "body": "the movement to stop ABA therapy is one that often does not consider the whole reality for many people who only have ABA services available to them. Especially, when the Autistic child is a higher support needs. Yea, it has a negative history and has caused harm but let’s not get on our high horse when it comes to psychotherapist and psychologist. Let’s not forget there were psychologist who were involved with the torture of prisoners, and the APA had to demand them to stop. Or therapy being mandated for people to avoid prison sentences. Yet people are told to go to therapy all of the time. \n\nABA should never forget its history, and continue to strive to do better. For therapist who advocate for the ceasing of ABA, I want you to ask yourself, are you equipped to work with a high support needs Autist? Someone who is non verbal? Do you take insurance? ALSO, to be frank, ABA is important for general safety. For example, a child who is stimming in a particular way may be accepted as a CHILD, but a grown adult or man (edit: I name man intentionally, because men are often perceived as dangerous culturally. For example: see man vs bear debacle on tiktok). Yeah that’s how autistic people die. Particularly Autistic people of color. Am I advocating for the erasure of stimming or having to mask all parts of oneself? Absolutely not, but if there is an alternative to still have needs met and have someone live to see the next day? Yeah I want that for someone. \n\nnot everyone has access to SLPs or OTs, and if ABA can help someone gain agency and autonomy, and that’s what we have RIGHT now, then that’s what we have. Let’s not forget the most marginalized of our community, and include their experience so that we don’t forgo needed services due to the desire for the most vocal.",

Kids that were extremely tied to their favorite toys being able to give them up, if only for a little bit. Kids that did not play well with others being tolerable of someone else in their space. \n\nWhen I worked in a psych hospital, I had a patient who was extremely autistic and had violent tendencies, but she answered well to ABA techniques (because her mother had her in the programs as a kid even though sh kept taking her out) and therefore I was the only one who could help her. \n\nI fully promote ABA as a person who had hands on practice, not just a read understanding. It’s funny because i’ll even use some of the techniques on non-Autistic patients. That premack is AMAZING. Ignoring negative behavior as to not reinforce it, but instead promoting positive behavior when you want something. To me, it’s all just a couple extra steps in teaching a person new skills. \n\nOf course it has a negative history. It’s psychology- almost all sciences have a negative history in one way or another.

I will say at my company we are working hard to recognize these problems and change the field. \n\nOur job is not to make our clients less autistic, we don’t force eye contact or extinguish stimming. We help our clients communicate their needs effectively so that they can be met, whether in home or out in the community. When we have older and verbal clients we ask them what they want out of therapy and how we can help them meet their goals. \n\nWe also help clients recognize and give to tools to regulate their emotions. Sometimes it’s as simple as giving them the words “I’m mad” and it stops a screaming meltdown. A lot of the population we work with has trouble being understood, and have sometimes picked up harmful behaviors in order to get their needs met. Our job isn’t to just squash the harmful behaviors it’s to figure out the function of those behaviors and provide them with a safe alternative.\n\nAlso it’s a lot of fun most of the time. Our motto is Happy, Relaxed, and Engaged, because most of our clients are so young the majority of the session is natural environment teaching and student lead. We really just get to play with them and make them laugh and it’s healing to the soul. Therapy isn’t effective if your kid hates being around you and is wildly more effective when they’re running to the door to greet you and asking about you when you’re not there.",

        "body": "Currently an RBT, been in this field for almost 2 years. Like any other practice, if you have horrible and unethical therapists, you’re going to get poor service and treatment. The problem to me with ABA is how pushed it is by insurance companies, to the point that ABA is really the only clinical service many families are able to afford, and a lot of big companies can be very cash-grab and overwhelm their techs and BCBA by pushing as many cases onto them as possible. Obviously ABA is not meant for every single person, for some kids and teens it’s helpful, for some it’s not. Also since the principle of ABA is to improve and work on all behaviors, I think some BCBAs can possibly treat their expertise and ABA as the “holy grail” and work in areas like speech or food therapy that isn’t within their purview and could possibly overstepped their scope of practice. I originally first worked at a big company and now work at a small-owned local company. My current company is very neuroaffirming and treatment is child-led. A couple of my fellow co workers and supervisors are also neurodivergent, and we really strive to create a safe, inclusive environment for our kids and individualized sessions that best fit each client.\n\nThose who wish to end ABA completely or very anti-ABA do not realize the decision to remove ABA is going to impact millions. ABA is a tool that isn’t just used during ABA therapy, the techniques and task list are seen in education (schools, daycares), used by social workers, seen in our day-to-day lives. I believe there are a lot of changes still need to be made in ABA, like when it comes to monitoring cash-grab companies, and I think to become an RBT you should need more than simply a high school diploma—a bachelor’s at least—but ABA therapy when implemented properly and when we have therapists who actually care for the client and are trained well can be not just helpful, but show immense improvement for clients to have independence, to take care of themselves, and have advocation for themselves.",

I think the best case uses are really young kids, or kids and adults with pretty profound cognitive disabilities. If you are able to access traditional and less invasive forms of therapy ir should be encouraged but a lot of people think merely having an ASD diagnosis is good enough.\n\nAnother big problem is the RBT model. Sometimes it works but most of the time its a joke. We take a person with a high school diploma and a pulse and put them in charge of therapy. Its wild we get away with it. I do parent coaching right now and most of my kids work on school readiness and working through tough situations. Some work on daily living skills. I think for the vast majority of kids I have worked with, enjoyed our time together and have stronger skills sets because of it. I kinda approach as life coaching for little kids and I want to be remember as the coach that was kind but pushed them to be their best self. I also talk a lot with families about how to set up their own lives to be more open and accommodating to their children. Some take the advice some dont \n\nIve had plenty of experience with the \"bad ABA\". I saw it a lot during my fieldwork and I think it absolutely can be as bad as the critics say. I think there are parts worth saving but broadly the field needs a lot of reforms.",

As a clinical intern at a youth DCF residential treatment facility I watched several ABA professionals design and administer ABA behavior plans for children with severe trauma and emotional/behavioral dysregulation. I’ve never seen or heard of any study suggesting that ABA is effective for this population. The kiddos didn’t need ABA they needed trauma-informed, evidenced-based modalities designed for youth with severe mental health disorders. Seeing ABA delivered to children who had previously been consistently raped and otherwise abused enraged me, but ABA seems beneficial for some individuals in more appropriate settings.",

Seek to understand, not memorize. Deep understanding and engagement with the material will help with recognition in multiple choice exams, and written answers will easier because even if you forget a key word, you’ll understand the concepts and feel more comfortable talking about it\n2. If a prof repeats something or emphasizes something in class with a ton of examples or in-class activity, it’s def on the exam\n3. Use colour and shapes when taking notes. Make important things more memorable (see point 2 lol)\n4. Make your own flash cards. I know what I said about memorization but hear me out - understanding the material will enable memorization, that’s a critical first step! I got a big pack of blank flash cards from Staples and wrote the key word/theory/concept/question on one side, and the definition on the other. Keep it punchy, try to use bullet points or short lists at most - no paragraph answers!! When you have free time, go through your flash cards and use a marking system. I used to put a little mark on a top corner if I got it correct. Once I answered the flash card correctly 5 times, I’d pull it out of the pack. A week before the exam, I’d reintroduce them to the pack and restart the marking system to refresh my memory. \n\nThis is what worked for me, anyways. The important thing to remember is that we’re all different and if a strategy isn’t working for you, let it go and try something else. Good luck!",

So many people drawn to this field have experienced mental health disorders (Marsha Linehan, creator of DBT for example, was diagnosed with BPD, and didn't make it public until after the success of her theory in treating it)! It’s actually more common than people talk about, especially when you’re first exposed to certain disorders or theories that hit a little too close to home.\n\nThe fact that you’re thinking deeply about this doesn’t mean you’re unfit for the work. It means you’re self-aware, which is a good thing. Most good therapists I know have gone through periods of emotional struggle themselves, it’s part of what makes them effective. What matters is learning how to manage that through your own therapy without letting it take over the space meant for clients. And that’s something training and experience helps with over time.\n\nIf psychodynamic work resonates with you, that’s a great sign as well, my program is psychodynamically focused, and the relational psychodynamic movement takes so much of your own identity into context to create meaningful relationship with the clients you're helping. \n\nI write a newsletter for psych students where I talk about stuff like this, imposter syndrome, self-doubt, emotional overlap with your studies, and how to grow through it without burning out.

I think a lot of people have this armchair-and-case-study view of psychology, and don't realize the methodological sophistication that professionals in the field need to develop. Granted, these elements became my favourite part of the program, but you will learn about and likely be expected to perform advanced procedures that underlie the knowledge in the field. Learning the process of designing, analyzing, and interpreting research studies to advance knowledge will, by and large, be more important than the already-established knowledge you will gain through general or discipline-specific psych courses (e.g., Intro Psych or Childhood Development).\n\nIf you just want to do counseling, you'll need less of this, but at least in my program it was still a requirement for undergrads to take basic stats and methods courses. Developmental and clinical tracks will almost definitely require that you get involved in research beyond your degree requirements. Now, if someone had told me this before I started, I likely would have been too intimidated to start at all, but I may have had more of a leg up if I knew a bit about what it all entailed. I recommend looking into the ins and outs of how psychological research is conducted at a practical level, and whether you need to do it to meet your career goals. \n\nAgain, I wound up loving it, but nobody told me about how complex it was, and it was absolutely not in any way what I expected going in.",

The thing about psychology is that most people find it interesting. When it comes to a career, however, it’s hard to find something that’s going to pay well unless you go all the way to a PhD. I’m not sure if you live in the US or not but it’s also worth noting that we are living in uncertain times right now in academia. The funding cuts that have happened will be and are effecting PhD programs. If you want to go the clinical psychology route that means what is already one of the most competitive areas is going to be that much more competitive. If you are just planning to do undergrad, you will probably be pretty limited to what jobs you can do (case manager, behavior technician, etc.). These roles generally aren’t the best paying. I don’t want to seem discouraging, I just wanted to offer my two cents as someone who just completed my masters in psychology. I have a lot of student loan debt and I am in the process of job hunting; the salaries even at a masters level aren’t the greatest.

If you want to be a clinical psych, you will need to do a BPS accredited BSC 2.1 or above and then get a master's. Even then, to be reconsidered for the professional doctorate needed to practice, you often need 2 to 3 years of clinical psych assistant roles to even be looked at. It's not an easy career to get into and then you have to deal with people at the worst possible times in their lives so burnout is common.

Any power differential that contributed to the abuse can affect the dynamics in the therapy room, even if the survivor was a child at the time and is now an adult. It can be hard for the survivor to advocate for themselves in the presence of a trigger and so the abuser sometimes gets the upper hand even in therapy, creating yet another path to abuse. I’m not saying it NEVER works, but it seems to me like the risk for more damage outweighs the possible benefit, considering it’s very possible for the survivor to heal without the abuser.\n\nI have seen a number of people in my personal life convinced of the same thing as your friend. I think it comes from the survivor’s desire to feel validated by their abuser, to get apologies or closure, or they think the therapist will be their ally and somehow make the abuser realize how much harm they have done. It’s natural to want that. Unfortunately, I haven’t seen any of that play out. The abuser usually just continues denying, victim blaming, manipulating, etc. and it is notoriously challenging to “make” people feel empathy when they don’t have much capacity for it. It is cruel fact that survivors don’t usually get closure or apologies, for the same reasons that the abuser engaged in that behavior in the first place. Survivors can usually heal better on their own with the support of an understanding therapist.\n\nIf you want a paper on it, there’s one here, but it doesn’t make recommendations, just has case studies of 12 people and outlines the opinions of both clients and clinicians, which vary greatly:\n\n https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16221652/",

        "body": "Oh boy. That’s a tough one. As a childhood abuse survivor myself, I think this truly depends on the person being dealt with. I’ll explain this better by relaying information about two separate abusers from my childhood. Some abuse without malice, while others are very deliberate in their actions and never feel remorse. With my mother… her abuse stemmed from a lifetime of abuse she had experienced herself. There was incredible guilt she felt in relation. On the other hand, another abuser was very deliberate in causing harm and almost thrived on the feeling he experienced when inflicting pain upon others. The inclusion of the abuser in treatment of abuse… is dependent upon where the abuser stands at this point in their life. Understanding the abuse my mother endured and her lack of having her own mother (her stepmother was highly abusive to herself and her brother) she mimicked behaviors she had learned unconsciously. However, later in life she, through her own healing process, because more aware of the harm she had caused herself. While I still do not have a great relationship with her, my understanding of what influenced her helped me to come to terms with the abuse. You see… when people learn from their wrongs… they then have something more to share in the healing process of those connected to them. While her involvement was triggering, the knowledge I gained helped me come to the conclusion that I was being wounded by someone who was already wounded themselves. This altered my perception of those behaviors. We all operate, in one way or another, from a place of unconsciousness. With that said, there was absolutely no benefit in the inclusion of the other abuser in this way. It was clear that this person was causing harm for mere enjoyment. For some reason this persons pleasure center was triggered when causing physical and emotional harm. While understanding this helped me to understand the kind of person I had experienced… ultimately any inclusion in growth in relation to those occurrences would not have beneficial. There had been no growth or acceptance of wrongs. This person cared not to understand their motivations and was still engaging in the same behaviors. Ultimately, it’s dependent upon the resilience and overall healing of the person who was victim to the abuse. The realization that this man had experienced no growth and remained stagnant in his life was enough for me to realize that he is trapped in his ways. Ways that only harm others. The thing is… once you see that… it’s almost as though it’s easier to let go of that person and the harm they’ve caused. Inclusion in the healing process would be a mistake.",

Usually senior professors and researchers from a university will serve on that university’s IRB as a part of their duties.\n\nAs a high school student you will not have access to an institution large enough to run their own IRB. Consider talking to your school librarian about what you want to research. They can help you learn to search databases of articles about the topics that interest you, and you can then apply to schools with those researchers. When you get there, ask to join their labs. Most domain-specific teaching done in psychology is done in these labs. You give your labor and they give you experience.",

My familiarity with conducting research comes mostly from working as a research assistant in my masters program, and then the formal research I’m conducting as a doc student, so I’m not quite as familiar with projects occurring outside of institutions. My understanding is that technically anyone in theory can conduct their own research. If you wanted to create an online survey and send it out to people, you could do that. Non-institutional orgs do that all the time. However, here are some things that come up as reflections for me:\n\nFirst, you’re talking about collecting health information that may be sensitive in nature, and you should ensure that you are familiar with and in compliance with any data privacy laws that would apply to your research.\n\nSecond, psychological research is governed by a set of ethical principles laid out by the APA. I don’t know if your project would be beholden to these ethical principles, as I’m this is outside my area of familiarity. Still, youre talking about collecting sensitive data from human subjects that will then be used for some purpose, so it would be wise to have an awareness of the ethical manner in which data should be collected, stored, and used. \n\nThird, if you plan to continue a career in the research field, I would be mindful that conducting research in a manner that is not well thought out, and involves poor or unethical data collection, handling, and reporting would be worse on your resume than getting experience as a volunteer research assistant. \n\nFourth, It would be wise to wait to engage in self-directed research involving participants until you have a baseline understanding of research methods and data analysis. For instance, knowing how to choose an adequate methodology, understanding the importance of how prompts are phrased, and knowing what data does and doesn’t say are examples of things that would be good to know, as well as how to ethically report and talk about data. If your intention was to create a social media presence around this topic, then having poor data or reporting data poorly or in a misleading manner (which often happens unintentionally) would weaken your cause. \n\nFifth and finally, are there easier avenues of data available to you? Are there specific things you are wanting to report on? There may already be research in this area you can make use of to save time \n\nOffering all of this because I’m in line waiting for an oil change and have the time, as well as because I love your enthusiasm and hope that you are able to continue this path in a way that sets you up for success. \n\nIf you have any specific data of interest, I would be happy to locate articles for you on the topic if they are available. I am also happy to answer any other questions about research you may have. Feel free to shoot me a message. All the best!",

Students who get into these programs have years of solid research experience in psychology or a closely related field and tend to apply to 15 or so programs all across the country in order to have a decent shot of admission. They have solid letters of recommendation from research professionals under whom they’ve closely worked. They also apply to programs strategically based on a close research fit with a particular faculty member who happens to be taking students in that particular cycle. Many very highly qualified applicants apply multiple cycles before getting an offer. Most folks move—sometimes across the country—for their program, again for their resident internship, and sometimes *again* for their postdoc. \n\nI’m not trying to discourage you, but this is the reality of the field. \n\nI suggest reading the pinned sub on Careers in Mental Healthcare (authored by myself), and then determining whether this route makes sense (or if another route would be a better fit). If it still seems like what you want to do, then consider ways to get prerequisite coursework done and get involved in research. Usually, 2-3 years of research experience is recommended.",

That said, if your primary goal is to be a therapist, a better path would likely be getting your masters. \n\nBoth PhD and PsyD programs can get you to clinical practice. The key difference is that PhDs are more research-focused and often more competitive, while PsyDs tend to emphasize clinical training and may be a bit more direct in terms of preparing you for therapy and assessment work. PhDs are usually stipended and paid for, but they take longer and expect more research involvement.\n\nIf you enjoy research and want the option to teach or publish down the line, a PhD might make sense. If you’re more focused on practicing full-time and aren’t as drawn to data or writing, then a PsyD could be a better fit. Masters in social work or counseling could also get you there, for less time and money compared to a psyd.\n\nColorado has some well-respected programs. Once you start talking to advisors, they can help you figure out where your background fits best and what prereqs you might need.\n\nI’m finishing my MSW now and write a newsletter for psych students and career changers where I break down stuff like this, comparing grad programs, deciding on clinical vs research paths, and how to figure out if the PhD route fits your goals.

I’m one of those people. I do pretty average in uni, but always get glowing reviews at work. So I supplement my average GPA by working in the field as much as I can. \n\nThat being said, if you want to continue down this path, find out why you aren’t doing well. Are you overwhelmed?

It sounds like that’s been your plan for a while, but if you’re realizing that research and statistics aren’t your strengths (or that the academic side just feels draining), that’s actually useful information. Clinical work, counseling, crisis response, community mental health, advocacy, none of those require a PhD, and they’re often a better fit for people who care about helping but don’t want to be in research-heavy roles.\n\nWhat you’re describing with the crisis line sounds hard, but it also sounds like you care. Everyone questions themselves after the first few conversations, it doesn’t mean you failed. That uncertainty is normal, and growth takes more than a single interaction.\n\nIf forensic psych specifically isn’t clicking anymore, that’s okay too. You can stay in your master’s program and still pivot slightly, maybe toward more applied or direct service work. Or you can take a break, get a job in a related area (case management, behavioral health tech, peer support), and figure out if helping people in a different setting feels better than the academic grind.\n\nAlso, you’re not a dropout. You’re someone reevaluating your path under pressure, and that takes way more strength than pretending it’s all fine.\n\nI write a newsletter for psych students who feel like they’re stuck or unsure where to go next. I talk a lot about career pivots, mental health in the field, and what to do when plans start falling apart. Happy to share the link if you’d like it. Whatever you choose next, just know this feeling doesn’t mean you’ve failed, this work isn't as simple as success and failure, and that applies to you as well! Give yourself grace, you deserve some.

My supervisor did a lot of research in the area of community firesetting (those who set fires in the community then  are detained in hospitals or prisons). But there’s very little research around institutional firesetting which refers to setting deliberate fires in forensic institutions you’re detained in. This is my PhD topic. It’s highly dangerous because according to HMPPS data, many prisoners and staff members sustain injuries or die because a deliberate fire was set. Such a fascinating topic and I can’t wait to see the results of my research",

For the literature review, try and identify which papers will be relevant and then follow a framework to write out your findings.

If your primary goal is to do psychotherapy, then I would go for the PsyD or a masters. \n\nA masters in social work (I'm biased toward this) or mental health counseling can absolutely allow you to diagnose mental illnesses, make assessments, and even teach in universities. The pay differential is difficult to pin down if you're going to be practicing psychotherapy, insurance companies compensate a PhD or PsyD roughly 25% more for a therapy session than a clinical social worker or LMHC, but this can vary. I went with my masters over PsyD because you can get an MSW in 2 years for $30-50k from a public university. The closest PsydD program to us (William James) costs $247,000 for 4 years (in tuition alone), just so I can do almost the exact same thing and have a title of doctor? Not for me!  \n  \nIf your primary interest is clinical work, especially diagnosis and therapy, and you have the financial means, a PsyD will give you more direct training in that area than a PhD program, they tend to have more practicum hours, less research pressure, and a stronger focus on clinical application from the start. I'm sure they do have some more to offer than a standard MSW program, but don't forget that in the state of MA you have about 3 of the top 15 MSW programs in the country (BU, BC, and Smith). \n\nPhD programs are more competitive, research-heavy, and typically take longer to complete (about 6–7 years, plus internship and postdoc). But they’re usually better funded and offer more flexibility if you ever want to pivot into research or teaching later. If you're genuinely interested in research and like the idea of teaching one day, the PhD path is the way you want to go, but without working 2 years in a research lab AFTER getting your bachelors, your chances of getting in straight from undergrad are low, their acceptance rates are 2-8% on average (med school is 40% for comparison). \n\nI write a newsletter for psych students where I cover stuff like this, differences between degrees, building experience in undergrad, and how to choose based on your long-term goals.

I know PhD is much more research focused whereas a PsyD will teach you specifically how to be a Psychologist and in the future I wanted to be a therapist specialized in diagnosing and supporting those with mental disorders/illness\n\nOne major point that is worth noting is that PhD's and PsyD's **both** require the same amount of clinical hours. One is not \"more\" clinical than the other, that is a misconception. The real difference is that a PhD is more heavily involved in research. Most PsyD's will still require a dissertation and stuff, but the process and requirements are likely to be less intense and rigorous. \n\nBoth *equally* teach you \"how to be a psychologist\" because a psychologist *is* someone with a doctoral degree in psychology, and that is the outcome of both degree program pathways. \n\n>doing Psych research on the side or becoming a professor later down the road both sound really interesting.\n\nThe PhD would probably be beneficial for tenure-track professorship positions. \n\n>Side question, which doctorate usually takes longer to become a therapist?\n\nPhD's are around 6-7 years, PsyD's are around 5 years\n\n>I care much more about getting quality education and experience but it would be a lie to say that I'm not slightly worried about how long it will take for me to get my feet on the ground with this path.\n\nBoth a PsyD and PhD offer quality education under the assumption that you are choosing a good program. On average, PhD programs are much more competitive than PsyD programs because there are a lot of shitty PsyD programs that skew the stats. Cohort sizes for both are usually quite different as well (smaller in PhD; larger in PsyD). \n\nA bad unfunded PsyD program will leave you in crippling debt which will certainly make it harder for you to get your feet on the ground, as you stated. There are partially funded and fully funded PsyD programs... but a good PsyD program is *just* as competitive as a PhD program. On the whole, PsyDs are much more expensive than PhDs. The most important part is simply choosing a good school (look for high EPPP rates, match rate should be 100%, small cohort size, and licensure rate should also be pretty close to 100%). You likely will not be held back by either degree if your goal is to go into therapy.",

No matter how good your grades are, your volunteer experiences, and where you graduated, you won't be competitive unless you have a depth of research experience of increasing complexity. Top candidates to these programs are coming in with multiple years of research experience, often with publications, conferences, and their strong letters of recommendation reflect these experiences. Not having that is a huge detriment for you.\n\nI have two bits of advice:\n\n1) If you haven't already, start looking for opportunities outside of your alma mater. You don't have to be a student at an institution to apply for their research positions unless it's directly tied to internal funding. I'm currently a RA with a lab outside my alma mater, and I knew multiple others who did the same.\n2) Apply for volunteer positions. Unfortunately, it's a reality that paid roles are often highly competitive and are not easy to access, especially for people who have no prior experiences. If you haven't already, you should be applying to labs in a volunteer RA capacity, which will make it more likely for you to be seriously considered. \n\nYour biggest priority right now, by and far, should be getting some solid research experience under your belt. 1 semester of experience is simply not enough. You need to demonstrate for adcoms that you have a solid understanding of the research process, from initial conceptualization all the way to knowledge translation, and every step in between. Barring that, it'll be very difficult for you to convince adcoms that you are ready for an intensive research program.",

Maybe you review a few notes during your commute or set aside one evening a week just for schoolwork and protect that time as much as you can, studying in increments might ease the pressure a bit. \n\nWeekends can be helpful if you use them with intention.

I would still sometimes have to rewatch the recordings if I was distracted but it was helpful to already have heard it a bit. \n\nI would try to ensure my Sundays were free and push myself through the weekdays. Even if I had things I needed to catch up on I knew I had a bit of leeway with no premade plans to do coursework on Sundays.  \n\nAnother tip is you can read notes aloud and record them to your phone, then listen on your commute as a way to study.",

Certain research topics (e.g., psychotic disorders, neurodegenerative diseases) are rare or nearly non-existent due to the historical focus on higher functioning individuals. Where these topics do pop up, the focus is usually on justice, stigma, or systemic barriers; clinical will often include those foci as well as direct research into neuroscience and mechanisms of pathology. Mood disorders (esp. depression), anxiety disorders, and trauma- and stressor-related disorders are well-represented in counseling psychology programs, as are topics related to interpersonal relationships, minority stress, LGBTQ+ populations, and intersectionality.\n\nIn contrast, clinical programs will contain social justice-type topics but often with less emphasis (though individual PIs may be exceptions, as is true in the opposite direction). Vocational counseling and assessment are far less common. Topics in health psychology, neuropsychology, and cognitive neuroscience are much more likely to arise. More severe pathologies are more likely to have research representation. Assessment is often more psychopathology-focused, though this isn’t absent in counseling psychology by any means.\n\nSome research topics (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, etc.) find comfortable homes in both subfields. Others are present in clinical but much more common in counseling (e.g., minority stress, interpersonal relationships, vocational work, etc.). Others (e.g., eating disorders, psychosis, etc.) are present in counseling but less prevalent—and often in different form (stigma vs. etiology, barriers vs. neuroscience)—than in clinical. It comes down to what your interests are and which individual programs are best suited to help you explore them.",

They were talking about it as if it was some random no-evidence pop psychology textbook by somebody they'd never heard of. I very much doubt that any of those posters studied psychology in the UK.\n\nUK courses will address the major landmark US experiments in social psychology, and developments in psychology in the English speaking world, like the shift from behaviourism to cognitive, which you can't talk about properly without including plenty about American psychology.\n\nAccredited UK courses have to cover a number of topics prescribed by the British Psychological Society, and that has a lot to do with course structure.\n\nHonestly, it seems more likely that American psychology teaching could be somewhat neglectful of developments made in other parts of the world, rather than vice versa.",

The curriculum is also less set in the American context. In my experience in the UK most of the classes you take in college are psych classes if you’re a psych major or if you’re a double major around 50% of your classes are psych. Most American universities have general education requirements so there are fewer classes within your major. Also the order in which you take psych classes is less set which means there’s less opportunity for instructors to build off existing knowledge they know students should have. I also think the standards for writing are higher at British universities but American universities expect students to do more assignments overall. Basically you get more depth in the UK and more breadth in the US. \n\nObviously this is all just my experience and not universal of course.",

We have to learn history, theory, behavior, cognitive science, anatomy, biology, genetics to a small extent, abnormal psychology and how it pertains to learning, intelligence, motivation, personality, emotions, socializing, communication, beliefs, conflicts, adversity etc etc etc. We have to learn math, statistics, and research methods, learn how to design studies.

They might not be intrinsically interested in a wide range of theories and models, which can make it seem like their knowledge is limited. Motivated self learner could read a few in-depth articles and gain better knowledge in a narrow area of psychology.\n\nBut the main difference is the sheer volume of work and time invested. My bachelor's degree takes 4 years, and I'm quite busy for about 10 out of 12 months each year. During that time, I attend lectures, prepare for exams, read academic articles, and write reports and papers across a wide range of topics—not just what I'm personally interested in. That includes multiple statistics, research methods, and psychometrics courses, which are all very demanding and often not the first thing someone chooses to learn on their own.\n\nAnother huge difference is retention and depth. When I read something just out of curiosity, without any pressure or structure, I often forget it more easily. But when I have to prepare for an exam—especially if I fail it and have to study again then it really sticks and it's more thorough. That repeated engagement, need to understand the material well enough to explain or apply it, and the feedback I get from professors and assistants develop framework of thinking.\n\nMost self learners can't recreate that kind of structure, depth and feedback on their own. Also in my experience bachelors give you nice introduction and overview of the psychology, it just lay foundations for scientific thinking and working in psychology.",

This would include the ability to identify peer-reviewed articles, understand the difference between an empirical article and a review article, recognize the difference between quantitative and qualitative data, and pull out main ideas from academic writing.\n\n\\- Introduce students to the conventions of writing in psychology. Along with following the specifics of APA style, there are also more general disciplinary norms. For example, using lots of quotes makes more sense in English or Philosophy, but in psychology writing it's usually better to keep the focus on the data and evidence.\n\n\\- Offer the kind of general exposure that starts giving students a feel for the kinds of research (or clinical work) that average folks in the field tend to do.\n\nIf I was trying to self-study at low cost, I'd probably start with Crash Course Psychology, then look for OER textbooks in each of the major areas of psychology (including methods!) and try to supplement with reading a few recent articles from open-access journals.",

If you're dead set on not going beyond a B.A. and want to work in the psych field, look into that position. There *may* be some scalability in your position as well.\n\nOther than that, I'd say either pursue the higher degree *or* pick a job outside of the field. Psychology is the kind of thing where, if your goal is to make a comfortable salary, you should expect to put in many more years of schooling for a higher degree. Most of the money is in doctoral degrees, but you can find jobs with a Masters depending on where you are. \n\nFind a program that is mostly funded, that way you aren't spending as much.",

And that is a *very* important distinction. No part of AI is self-aware, or capable of self-reflection. Most LLMs have very limited ability to alter their own code, if they have that capacity at all.\n\nIn short: no, LLMs are nowhere near anything philosophers or psychologists should call “sentience.” That doesn’t make the research less important, but we should be much more judicious and not sensationalize results that align with our own latent desires for true synthetic sapience.",

Well, a lot of therapists have their perspectives on what they think works and what doesn't work you're just introducing a huge amount of bias. \n\nI don't necessarily think a tech bro is the right guy to design the system, but they may be better at taking the data from the research and synthesizing it into a software program than a therapist would. And there may be researchers who are better at designing and analyzing the studies to see if the therapy is beneficial.\n\nPart of my concern is that a lot of therapists may have a tremendous amount of bias because they're worried about protecting their jobs.\n\nOne area where I think AI therapy could really help is by giving feedback to therapists. Imagine if we had an AI system that could watch therapy sessions and then point out any biases the therapist might have, or let them know when something they said isn’t backed by facts. It could also help with creating future treatment plans. Plus, it could watch for small signs in patients that the therapist might not notice.\n\nMy concern is I think the field of therapy may be very biased against AI. I think a lot of therapists believe that empathy is the primary and core reason why clients get helped, and I think many therapists believe that AI can't give off a sense of empathy that would be beneficial to clients.\n\nI also think that AI doesn't have to be better than the best of us, it just has to be better then a quarter of us. If you have a one in four chance of getting a therapist that is going to be worse than an AI then we will get destroyed by the AI market.",

I’m studying to become a psychotherapist and I have been involved in research with AI use. Part of my learning has been the emphasis of empathy/ therapeutic alliance/ and the importance of this rapport in effective/ successful therapeutic outcomes. Even when presented with the same situation, different therapists can have different interpretations. I see this as a double edged sword, possible unconscious unnoticeable biases yet some may lead to a healthier/ secure connection between the client and therapist. \n\nI am in agreement with seeing how AI may not necessarily be a replacement. There is value in enriching care. Possibly an additional modality if support in mental health care. For example, there are focus groups/ educational groups that families participate in prior to referral to OT, PT, psychotherapist for somatic disorders. I can see AI being useful for educational purposes. Hospitals may have a use for AI in inpatient programs which can lead to more focused therapeutic work later on. AI may address short term support and fill those gaps while therapists may have a role in more consistent, long term support. \n\nCurrently AI has also been used as a simple scribe tool for helping therapists with case notes. Potentially, AI can also be used to take on more administrative tasks…\n\nJust some thoughts, as this topic does warrant attention and would be helpful to consider the many aspects of how AI could potentially interact with mental health care.",

Basically whatever human cannot accomodate: ai should be able to fit in.\n\nSo I’m a psych student, 1st year undergrad and a former aged care nurse who worked in palliative and dementia care for 8 years. I still have maybe 5 odd years before I get my license. I also am a client. \n\nThe fluidity and flexibility of AI is absurd. Because of how easy it is to make an account and a new option to have ai remember certain commands and requests, it can be utilise each and every day for adaptive means. Ai really has a lot going for it as it is learning as we utilise it more. With that said,\nI think the one thing that a lot of people don’t acknowledge from a client perspective is how accessible it is. \n\nFor instance: I cannot call my psychologist up at 3am because I’m having a PTSD episode and don’t want to go to hospital. They won’t really do anything while I’m there due to me being sound of mind, and all I do is have an option to sleep and possibly get that “first night” feeling that we all get where we sleep somewhere foreign. So in this case what would I do? Well, call beyond blue or Lifeline (Australia mental health services). Oh no. It’s a half hour wait, but for me that is a year long of a wait. I don’t have that time I’m in crisis NOW. I’m sitting for half an hour strewing about my current crisis. But hang on a minute, have capacity to reach my phone.\n\nAh. AI is there and ready to help. Whether I’m going to use it safely or not is a different story. But the knowing of it being there and able to response immediately is a huge benefit.\n\nI genuinely believe that there needs to be an acknowledge that AI does have a place. It’s up to us to determine what that place is and for me, It would be the accessible hours of it. I don’t have this replace my therapy. In fact, my therapist utilises it as a tool for me to bring myself back when I don’t have access to her. She works 3 days a week. I don’t have constant contact. \n\nWith that said… I don’t think many would have the restraint of therapy use if ai like I do. I keep it strict with my time on ai because it’s only a substitute PRN if that makes sense. And that’s if I’ve exhausted every other avenue.\n\nThis is just going off the main point and surface level of AI. Honestly I took my sleep meds and barely have capacity to get into detail on the problems AI has (plagiarism, false info, lots of unethical stuff etc) \n\nSo I mean. I’m for it with a blanket of ignorance. It’s helped me see sunrise more than I would like to admit.",

Even professionals link educational or soothing videos for clients to peruse at home when they need it. There are dangers to it from self-diagnosing, but it's undeniable that it is a very popular tool.\n\n\nAI is another evolution of the above. People will self-direct how they use this tool.

However, sometimes there are incentivized shifts that pay more such as night shift in the E.D. Psych hospitals are typically a lot slower in the summer time so now would be a great time to apply.\n\nI also second getting a small research gig within whatever university you are in, you can reach out to a professor or program director for more info they’re always wanting to help!! \n\nI also reached out to a professor whose class I loved and asked if they needed a teaching assistant for the next semester, that was only like 10extra hours a week for me but I learned tons and it was a great resume builder. (Was also a lovely point of contact while going through applications, having questions, or just for a letter of recommendation) \n\nClinical psychology degrees and honestly any fully-funded phd programs are quite competitive compared to any masters programs. It depends what you want to pursue, but while you have the time now might as well rack up the experience. Most places will require at least 3 letters, so a clinical supervisor, research coordinator, and professor are all wonderful options!

A job you ould target now would be any kind of administrative assistant for a private practice. This could give you exposure to billing and insurance processes. They do NOT cover any of that in grad school.\n\nDM me if you have more specific questions. I am more broke now than I have ever been and yet I come home from work each day feeling more fulfilled than I ever did in the corporate world.",

I'm doing the latter because it's therapist or bust for me; I have been given advice to pursue the MSW because it's more broad, but I don't really know what that means. You could do a PhD in clinical psychology or a PsyD, but the path is much longer, more expensive and I'm not sure that your background would get you into a program.\n\n4) My background was sufficient to get me into three different counseling masters programs; I did take an intro to psych just to dip my toe into going back to school.\n\nAlso -- if there is a modality you want to specialize in, you might want to look into what it takes to get trained in that modality outside of school. It can be expensive and you may want to factor that into your overall training expenses. I personally made a decision to get the cheapest but still well-rated degree I can, because I am IFS level 1 trained and would like to invest in Level 2 and 3 before I leave school, which will be another $10k between training and travel. \n\nHope this helps!

The great thing about the mental health field is that it is very open to career transitions, and your demographic makes up a large portion of students and practitioners. But you should look at the caveats for admission. A masters of clinical mental health will prefer students with any form of experience of clinical care like nursing. Any religious-affiliated program will prefer students of the same religion. Masters of social work programs have the least requirements. All programs can lead to the same job.\n\n\n2. See the above. Also consider that LMFT is not just marriage, it is also family. Family counseling involves working with children specifically as children do not have the right of securing their own therapeutic services. \n\n\n3. A good masters program is well networked with local businesses and organizations. Research programs and ask them what opportunities they provide.\n\n\n4. Receptionist / intake coordinator is the easiest job to obtain. Other than that, I recommend volunteering, because that gives the real hands-on experience of working 1:1 with people in need without any prerequisites.",

I believe, at least for me, it is like a valve releasing stress.\n\nIn a lot of things, I enjoy being challenged, and I wonder if it has affected me, or primed me for this type of response. I literally feel a strange emotion akin to joy, but NOT joy, when it hits. I would compare it to an adrenaline rush, of all things. After (and even during) the laughing episode, I feel more alert, and the feeling is often accompanied by a burst of energy. Sometimes the energy is constructive, where I want to redouble my efforts when I am doing something, or leave the environment if it is a social stress. Sometimes it is destructive, and I want nothing more than to isolate and punch an inanimate object.\n\nThis might be the most personal part of it, and I couldn't even make an assumption about other people responding similarly (because I believe it is linked to my personal belief structure), but I often shout, mentally or otherwise, at the universe itself: Sometimes to taunt it, sometimes to ask it \"Why me?\"\n\nAfter an episode, I am usually drained emotionally, but the physical energy is usually retained.

Explore and see what opportunities line up with your interests. \n\nGetting an MSW will set you up for a variety of jobs, you could work in schools, hospitals, community mental health centers, residential housing, for your state government, for the courts, in prisons, the list goes on. So yes, your training will apply and through your internship you can work with children, and you can take classes that relate to what your interests are.  \n\nYou definitely don’t need a BSW to get into an MSW program. Most programs are built for students coming from related majors like psych or human development. Your psych background will be an asset, especially if you can speak to how your interests evolved and why social work feels like the right fit now.\n\nI went straight from undergrad to getting my MSW, but I did have experience in undergrad that helped inform that decision. Working a related job will give you data as to whether you'd like to go into this work or not, I'd say most people traditionally get some experience after undergrad before going for the MSW. \n\nI write a free weekly newsletter for psych students who are navigating exactly these kinds of decisions!

From what I understand consumer psychology is the study of how consumers behave and make decisions and how they feel when purchasing something, or what psychologically makes a consumer more likely to purchase something. It could suit your interest in advertising and marketing but I’m not sure how many jobs are out there for consumer psychologists. \n\nIndustrial/organizational psychology is studying behaviour in work environments among staff and managers and how to use psychology to make a workplace more efficient. It’s more internal than consumer psychology (you’re working more with staff instead of customers) but could also suit your interest in that realm since it’s more corporate-y and not counselling. \n\nHowever, I don’t know where you live but I’m pretty sure in most places you require at the very least a masters degree for these positions, and the majority require even a PhD. So long story short you’ll need to go to grad school either way if you truly want a job in psychology. \n\nI don’t know much about the other fields you mentioned but most of them you’ll still need some kind of specialty license or something like that - to work as a neuropsychologist I think you’d definitely need a PhD, to work in law or social justice you’ll probably need to go to law school or complete some kind of law focused course, public relations is possible with a degree in psychology but probably won’t be very psychology oriented, and UX/UI design I think you can teach yourself online or something? It’s also important to note whatever job you DO find in most of these fields won’t be high paying off the bat and they’ll be entry-level positions and without experience in the field you’ll likely start a lower salary than industry average…especially without more schooling or a license.\n\nI think you really need to narrow your interests down to one or two things and do extensive research into how to work in these fields, especially if you’re not looking to study or train for a long time to do it. Like some people have mentioned already, it’s possible to research neuropsychology without a PhD but I imagine there’s certain steps you need to do to get that kind of niche researching job (which probably won’t make a lot of money at first). There’s probably ways to get into the other fields you mentioned but you need to pick one area and maybe down the line you’ll find a way to merge interests. (For example maybe you can work in public relations for a neuropsych clinic/hospital? Or do UX/UI design for a law firms website?) Your interests are too scattered which is why you feel so lost so try to see which interests you the most and stick with just that for now, it’ll feel less overwhelming.",

Any government or state role will require a very specifically formatted resume. Try to avoid italicizing a ton, and keep it Bold instead. \n\nFor starters, I would not include your interests in your resume- they’re unnecessary and infantilize you a bit (really not trying to be rude, I promise, just genuine!) you can let your coworkers discover those traits as you get to know each other! \nList your work experience first and foremost. The job, the site, the address, and then under that- your specific role and the amount of hours a week. Perfectly fine if it’s only two hours, that’s common for research roles in undergrad! If you received any salary, list that on the same line as well. The comments saying to put everything into bullet points with verbs are correct. Make sure you use the correct tenses for everything- if it was a job you aren’t currently working, the verbs are in past tense. You can also include FAR more for those roles than what you have! Make sure to include every little thing you did for each role, seriously, it matters! Include the supervisor for that role, too, along with their email, underneath. \n\nRemove your education and GPA from the top, put in under your work experience section, list your degree, GPA and graduation date in bold. I.e., Bachelor of Science, Psychology, minor in Gender & Women’s Studies, X State University, December 2025, GPA 3.68. The /4.0 is unnecessary, that’s the standard scale. Under that, put “relevant coursework:” then list the courses you took that pertain to the role you’re applying to, these can be edited and changed as needed. Under THAT, “honors/societies:”, you can include clubs, the honor society, and any honor roll/dean’s awards, etc. \n\nCreate a singular section for certifications, you’ll be adding to this as you progress throughout your career, it’s okay if it’s minimal for now. Remove the “skills,” and instead put, “Additional Experience,” and list any skills or qualities you think aren’t highlighted in your work experience or are necessary for the position you’re applying to.\n\nThe comment about creating a section for your presentations is spot on, great advice, follow that! \n\nAt the very bottom, list your references. Name (underlined), place of work, specific role. Under that (here’s where we italicize), put what they were to YOU (former supervisor, professor, etc.) Under that, “Email:”, then under that, “Phone:” \n\nBear in mind, your resume will be a living document throughout your career that you’re constantly adding to, and editing for each role you apply to! If you’d like me to send you my resume for reference, just send me a message! :)",

I initially had an interest in psych as a freshman in undergrad, but my parents were highly controlling and talked me out of it, playing into my fear to do so. So, I went into the other field I am good at, which was English and Creative Writing. I now have around a monthly publication for an online magazine when I have time to write and research new articles. I also got into English language teaching and wrote a masters thesis that dealt with creative writing in a target language and its effects on learner's metacognition. Then, the pandemic really negatively impacted that field. Plus, I had been living abroad when it hit, attempting an ultimately failed PhD, in part due to the pandemic.\n\nFrom there, I did a Coursera course in data analysis and was trying to figure out how to use that while working on my own issues from growing up in the environment I did. Eventually, due to a few interpersonal crises that kept reoccurring, I realized that I am pretty good at actively listening and keeping others calm. After that, I realized that I still had an interest in psychology and felt I could be a good therapist. So, I consulted a counselor I knew about practicing in the country I had been studying in the pre-pandemic times and asked them how they got into the field and what to expect from it. I also asked my longtime friend about her experience as a counselor for the past decade. \n\nAfter really sitting with that information and considering what that path looked like while waiting for the end to those reoccurring crises, I decided to find a school that would allow me to transfer my past education into an online Bachelor’s program that I could also have some foundational knowledge of counseling and mental health built into the degree. I am currently in an internship and am set to take my final class in August. From there, I'm hoping to work as a clinician’s assistant in a remote position, but I'm also open to data analysis and other things psych related. I'm also planning to see if I qualify for membership to the psychological society in the country/countries that I'm interested in pursuing postgraduate education in, so that I could further my goal of being a counselor, though I'm fully aware that it might require a doctorate, depending on where I study. So, I hope to at least maintain a job while going through further education.",

You should pursue research that you are passionate about, but her instinct to temper her expectations about this with the need to do things in an academically serious manner is actually a really good instinct. Once she looks into what a scientific study of this would actually look like, it will change her perspective a lot, and you should always be open to changing your vision for the future as you become more and more informed about things. \n\n  \nUsually, when I design an experiment, I end up doing something that is quite different (and a lot better) than my original plan.

Also, what are the opportunity costs?\n\nFor example, if you're currently making $50,000 a year, and your degree will take four years of full-time study and cost you $60,000, the total cost is about $260,000. That includes lost income and tuition. If you finish your degree and then start earning $70,000 a year, it could take you 17 years just to break even. And honestly, that's a rough estimate because it doesn't include the interest you could've earned if you had saved that money instead. If you need to take out student loans, the break-even point gets pushed even further. In that case, you might not start making a profit from your degree until you're around 69 years old. And if you're also planning on getting a master's degree, that's another two years and another $50,000.\n\nOn the other hand, if you've already been running a successful construction business for 20 years and making around $3 million a year in profit, then going back to school could be a great opportunity. You’d probably learn a lot and benefit in other ways too.\n\n\nI pulled a lot of numbers out of my butt, and I don't know your situation and what programs you are looking at. Run your numbers. It is easy to say you can do anything if you dont understand economics and math.",

There is an empirical basis for its use in differential diagnosis of psychosis and it has variables with statistically significant relationships with sub-psychotic impaired reality testing, anxiety, depression, dependency, and overall internal coping ability. \n\nMy dissertation focused on the presentation of complex and manifest trauma on the Rorschach and empirical support for both of those varieties of trauma is also present on the instrument. \n\nI am lucky to belong to a doctoral program where the Rorschach and its scientific basis are considered and taught. Many doctoral programs fail to teach students about this instrument and less well-rounded clinicians can be the result. \n\nHowever, the Rorschach is best used in a multimethod assessment context. It can be used as a standalone tool along with a clinical interview, especially in assessing psychosis, but the application of the instrument is best demonstrated when combined with self report or other performance based measures. I love the Rorschach and I hope to continue to use it in my career. Unfortunately it is quite expensive to administer because of the time involved, and scoring it can be quite a nuanced process because there are many scoring categories and rigid rules associated with proper scoring to ensure inter-rater reliability.",

Here are a few tips:\n\n1. Only get rec letters from psychology professors. If they ask for 3, make sure all 3 come from PSY professors. Bonus points if you get your statistics professor to write you one, this always looks good in every application. When you put rec letters from irrelevant subjects or jobs that are not relevant to PSY, you are trying to make a thin file look fat, they don't like that.\n\n2. Your entrance paper shouldn't be more than 2 pages long, if possible,  make it 1 page long. That's it. The longer your paper, the less chances you have of getting admitted. Write about who you are, what you did to get here, what your goals are and how the program would benefit from having you. The end, don't write your autobiography in there, no one has time to read it. I read somewhere here that you spoke about your mom in your essay. As moving and touching as that maybe, don't talk about that. It makes it look like you're trying to garner sympathy, could come off as manipulative. \n\n3. If there's an interview process, study up on basic developmental stages, have a favorite theorist in mind, and brush up on your typing skills, some interviews require you to write a full 2-3 page paper in 20 minutes. \n\n\n4. Use AI sparingly. You can use it to polish your work, but never use it to do your work. You'll loose out on critical writing skills and the ability to critically think. Keep that brain sharp.\n\n\nHope this helps, good luck on your next round of applications.\n\nPS: I have stuck to the format listed above, and I helped a few of my friends, they stuck to this format and were accepted first try.",

If you’re not looking to go into research or academics (teaching psych at a university), you don’t need internships before a Masters. There are tons of online Master’s programs that you can do that require no references or internships (literally block people if they start talking badly about these programs). Just make sure they’re accredited. And yes, if you want a masters that leads to a license, you should look for masters in mental health counseling rather than a masters in clinical psychology (typically research-focused). \n\nFor example, I want to get my masters in marriage and family therapy. Touro University Worldwide offers this online, no references, no internships, and it’s COAMFTE accredited. \n\nEach kind of program will be accredited differently (MSW, masters in counseling, etc.), so just google that a little.

A BA in Psychology is a common and perfectly valid starting point for a Master’s in Counseling. I'd say it doesn't hurt to apply, and there are many programs that offer a part time track to get your LMHC or MSW (depending on whether you need to work while in school or not). \n\nThe quickest path to becoming licensed to administer psychotherapy are your masters in counseling or masters in social work. I am biased as a social worker, but I would definitely make sure not to overlook that path, it's a bit more versatile than a masters in counseling, you can work in hospitals, schools, community mental health clinics, private practice, and so much more with a degree in social work. \n\nIt’s true that letters of recommendation and experience help. But that experience doesn’t have to come from traditional internships or volunteer hours—working in customer service while parenting and earning a degree during a pandemic is an enormous display of resilience, time management, and people skills. Remember that the people who work in these programs and do admissions are often therapists themselves! Frame it that way. Schools understand that not everyone has the luxury to volunteer or join a lab—especially first-gen students or working parents.\n\nThat said, if you’re able to get even a few hours a week in a behavioral health tech, residential counselor, or crisis line role before you apply, it can make your application even stronger and help you feel more certain about the path. But it’s not a must.\n\nAnd that “light bulb” moment you described? That’s not random. Most good counselors I know had that same click—that feeling of this is what I’m meant to do. And your instinct to support without overstepping, to suggest therapy when needed, to listen deeply and offer grounded perspective—that’s the core of the work.\n\nI write a free weekly newsletter for psych students (and future counselors) where I break down exactly this kind of stuff—how to choose the right program, what counts as experience, how to write a strong application even if your path hasn’t been traditional.

For additional context, I was making +$100K with just a bachelors in psych.\n\nWithout going for licensure, it is my belief (I have no research to back this), that you must then pivot to actually working with data and becoming familiar with data. I’m not saying you need to basically do a self-taught mathematics or compsci degree. I’m also not saying that just watching excel videos on YouTube will work. You earnestly have to learn about statistics, models, data wrangling and handling, communication, and - very importantly - business functions. If you can also be so lucky(!) to apply this in the context of other well sought positions, you can quickly climb the salary ladder in this field. Some of these other contexts would be quality assurance, finance, development/fundraising, and Human Resources. \n\nI want to also re-emphasize the luck part of this. Getting your foot in the door with any of these types of positions will inherently require luck (and for some with societal privilege, that will also be beneficial).",

Notice how not everything was direct psych, but substitute teaching looked great because I was working with kids!\n\nMany psych students take a year or two for work like this before diving into upper-division classes or grad school—it can actually make you a stronger applicant.\n\nI put out a free weekly newsletter for psych students that covers finding entry-level roles, what hiring managers look for, and how to turn early jobs into solid references.

In my experiences and encounters with people who are Ph.D students in clinical psychology, they view us as the “less educated” or the less impactful field within psychology. I think a lot of this is kind of due to tribe mentality and ego surrounding level of education. There are many people who think that a Masters is beneath a Ph.D and so our education and our knowledge must be inferior. I’ve actually had someone argue that therapy has no part in psychology and is a more of a pseudoscience where psychologists are the actual scientists and spearheads of psychology. I think it is these individuals who forget that psychology’s main roots are grounded in the study of human behavior and thoughts which have been designed to help people understand and modify their own maladaptive behaviors to improve upon themselves and their lives. \n\nTherapy is a growing field that will always be more on the side of demand than supplied. As we continue to grow and evolve as humans, we will continue to want to better ourselves, our relationships and our mentality. There is always a demand for healing ❤️‍🩹 \n \nFor all that we sacrifice (our time with family and friends, the second hand trauma that many will suffer along with the potential for burnout) and all that we endure to ensure that others can achieve mental stability, there sometimes isnt enough respect for the ground work or the direct care we provide to clients. Many of us have chosen the path because we have a deep desire to help others. Many of us are extremely empathetic people who feel empowered by enpowering others. Some of us have even endured our own trauma and scars and want to give back and help those who are or have been unable to break free from their trauma. It is a field full of love, care and deep desire to help better all humankind. It also takes a lot of patience, knowledge and self-discovery to build up the emotional intelligence that it is needed to be an effective and successful therapist. \n\nAll of the various disciplines within the field of psychology are all very important. They also need each other to help continue making advancements and progress within the study of human behavior. Therapist need psychologist for the work they do on assessing and determining various factors that can contribute to mental illness while psychologists need therapists to determine the most effective therapeutic approach when working directly with clients to resolving symptoms and restoring mental stability. \n\nI have mad love and appreciation for everyone who chooses to go into a field to help others. \n\nThank you for all your hard work and your continued dedication to helping others ❤️",

I’ll add that many therapists discover their “go-to” approaches by trying a few on, noticing what feels authentic, and then doubling down on supervision around those methods. In other words, you don’t have to pick your forever orientation on day one—grad school and early clinical hours are where you find your groove. Experience informs practice, and it is a constantly evolving process.\n\nFor students weighing the field (or wondering whether they’ll enjoy the work once the textbooks close), I put out a free weekly newsletter that breaks down things like:\n\n* what therapists actually do between sessions\n* the messy process of finding your theoretical fit\n* early-career crossroads (licensure, private practice, agency life, etc.)\n\nIf that sounds helpful, just let me know and I can drop the link.

They are the closest thing we have to an \"alien\" intelligence on this planet, and it tells us a lot about ourselves.\n\n\"The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat\" along with other books by neurologist Oliver Sacks contains various stories of people with neurological disorders whose brains have stopped working in very strange ways. The way our brains \"glitch\" like a computer can tell us so much about how they work, and produce fascinating (if heartbreaking) stories.\n\n\"Incognito: The Secret Lives of the Brain\" by Neuroscientist David Eagleman is a great primer into how the brain works behind the scenes to create the life you live in general.\n\nAnd I can't help but recommend my professor's own book \"Being You: A New Science of Consciousness\" by neuroscientist Anil Seth is an exploration of the emerging development of scientific methods into studying consciousness itself. \n\nGood luck on your journey!",

I go to a smaller, teaching-focused university in the US, so research experience was something I had to seek out aggressively. Although I graduated with my BA, I haven't started a graduate/MA program. Having a faculty mentor has helped me tremendously. So, if you have contacts at your university, I would try contacting them directly and ask if they have a project you could assist with. The downside to this approach is it will likely be unpaid. I’m lucky enough to have a monthly stipend.\n\nIf you don't mind me asking, I'd love to know what specific area of psych research you’re interested in and what your theses were focused on.

People feel distressed by unpleasant movies because they’re unpleasant. People feel distressed by unsolicited negative information because it’s negative. \n\nThose are all very normal experiences.

Upon advice of the program director, I also applied to join a research group and became a very active member. Once I completed the prerequisites and then some, which took about a year, I applied for several programs and was accepted into the one at the school where I took my courses. It is extremely competitive at the state schools because tuition is a fraction of what you’ll pay at a private school. I went to in person classes mostly with a few intercession online classes mixed in. I was able to get strong letters of recommendation from instructors at the in person classes. I start the 2 year MS program in the fall, which will include providing therapy on campus for the first year and an internship providing therapy outside the university for the second year. \n\nIn my case, I didn’t need to work during the period I’ve been taking classes and doing research, which I realize isn’t an option for everyone.

So my suggestion would be for you to look at MSW programs at UP, I have a few friends in the program and they all say it’s great.\n\nUnlike psychology, the MSW is considered the terminal degree. Meaning the MSW is the highest value degree in social work. There are PhDs and DSWs, but employers will specifically state that the doctorate degrees do not replace the need of an MSW. \n\nEdit: And guess what? Social work has a whole branch known as School Social Work. Where you’re imbedded into a school as like an onsite therapist for the students. This also includes a lot of caseworking for the students as well.",

It just means you’ll need to actively create the kind of experiences that students in in-person programs might stumble into more naturally. That can look like volunteering at a crisis line, reaching out to professors for remote research assistant gigs, or finding part-time work in a psych-adjacent setting (behavioral health tech, case management, residential counseling, mental health counselor). None of that has to be full-time to count. Not sure how much experience you have working in mental health, but it wouldn't be a bad idea to take a gap year and get some data on if this is what you want to do for the rest of your life. What you learn in the classroom is a much different experience than the work itself. \n\nAs for figuring out what path fits you, try this: what kind of problems are you most curious about solving? People’s emotions, behavior patterns, communication, systems? Psychology is broad, and that’s not a bad thing, it just means you get to test-drive a few things. If you’re interested in therapy, shadowing or volunteering in mental health settings helps. If you lean toward research, look for faculty at other schools doing work you’re interested in and shoot them a short email asking if they’d be open to remote help.\n\nOn the GPA thing: schools will look at your transcript and see pass/fail, but it won’t kill your application if the rest of your materials are strong. You’ll want solid letters, relevant experience, and a personal statement that clearly explains why you're pursuing the path you’re choosing. You can still be competitive, especially for master’s programs. Also if you're hoping to be a therapist, you would typically not get a masters then a PhD, pick one or the other, both are a path to licensure. \n\nAnd yeah, master’s programs are often more expensive with less funding than PhDs, but they’re also easier to get into and a more direct path to licensure if you want to practice. PhDs are funded but longer and harder to get into, and usually more research-focused. PsyD is another path, 4 years and very very expensive and easier to get into than PhD.  All depends on your goals, and you've got time to figure it out. \n\nI run a free newsletter for psych students who are figuring all of this out, career direction, how to build experience when you're on your own, and what actually matters in grad apps. Let me know if you want the link. I believe in you!",

ABA has helped so many individuals and families and it *has* evolved. \n\nA wide variety of centers nowadays use much more naturalistic methods. ABA (depending on setting, I recommend a clinic to in home) helps kids learn to share and engage with peers, social skills, emotional regulation skills, hygiene skills, the list goes on. I actively saw kids progress every single week. ABA is a wonderful clinical experience to have though this will greatly vary on the center. If you work in a center w young kids you will feel much like a daycare worker at times. You may see some unethical practice as well. Sometimes it feels like you’re a scientist poking at a lab rat for sure. But if done correctly it can help a child grow immensely. Also depends on what your goals for grad school are.

To me, the point of higher education is simply, to become more educated in what you are passionate about. \n\nIf you aren't interested in a degree for a particular occupation, and just want to learn more about what you are interested in, I would suggest the switch to what I wanted to learn. \n\nIf, however, there is a particular occupation you want to get into and are going to college to get that job...it depends on if the MA path has required prerequisites. If they do, you'll need to find out what classes you need. \n\nAll that said, if a job is your concern, sans fields like medical & mental health, you can get many jobs, if not most, that \"require\" a degree, even without one. \n\nMost of the jobs I've gotten required a degree. Some even required certs. Despite not having a degree until recently, I have been hired as an IT/help desk engineer, a network engineer, tier 2 & 3 tech support for Verizon FiOS, BPOS engineer at Microsoft, and Amazon Kindle. I've also been hired on as a customer service manager as well as a housing case manager for low income housing. \n\nWhile all of those jobs required a degree, I was hired despite not having so much as a BA. It's about having confidence in your own abilities, but mostly it's how well you sell yourself.",

A lot of people don’t figure that out until they’re in the middle of a grad program (or even after finishing one), so you’re not behind.\n\nIt’s true that research-based master’s programs don’t lead to licensure, and that can feel limiting if jobs are sparse. But it doesn’t mean your work so far is wasted. You’ve built a foundation in developmental psych, and that can absolutely carry over if you decide to shift into something like child therapy, speech therapy, or even social work. Yes, you might need to do another degree, but you wouldn’t be starting from scratch. You already have research and teaching experience, which a lot of clinical grad programs actually value in applicants.\n\nIf you're leaning toward therapy, I’d take a little time to explore which license path aligns best with your interests and timeline. MSW programs are often more flexible and shorter than something like speech therapy, and they still let you work with kids and families in clinical settings. But if you’re more drawn to communication and language development, speech could make sense too.\n\nI write a newsletter for psych students and career changers where I talk about stuff like this, switching tracks, career pathways, and what to look for in a grad program if you go that route.

We then had honours classes (advanced research methods, quantitative statistics, etc.). These courses tied into our general coursework as they could be used to fulfill the required credits in our degrees, but some were more about “enrichment.” For example, we had to take an entire class about presenting research and applying for graduate school. \n\nThe length of an honours thesis completely depends on the supervisor and the program. The honours thesis for my psychology degree was 68 pages. The honours thesis for my nursing degree was… 7 pages.  We began working on my thesis in the summer after completing my second year of my degree (so the bulk of the work was completed in 3rd and 4th year). You typically conduct studies, gather data, analyze data, do a write-up of your findings, and present. For example, we conducted 7 studies for my thesis, 5 of which were used in the write-up, and I did 2 poster presentations and 1 presentation in front of the faculty. I spent hundreds of hours analyzing data and writing it out, but it was fun. \n\nFrom what I understand, professors will only assist with a bachelor’s thesis if that student is in the honours program.",

And the work you need to do to be eligible for those posts is also low paid - it may even have to be volunteering to get the right experience at first.\n\nI know someone who has been involved in interviewing NHS clinical psychologists, and many of those psychologists (far more than is ideal for truly understanding the options open to patients from deprived or even average backgrounds) have well off parents and/or well off husbands, who enabled them to get through the process of getting experience that leads to the funded portion of training. (and don't forget that bursaries don't stretch as far as they used to either, as they haven't kept up with inflation.)\n\nOf course, some people from less well off backgrounds do make it through, but it is tough, and you need to have stamina for working a lot of hours.\n\nIf finances are your priority, your best bet would be to apply for good graduate jobs after your 1st degree, get several years of earning and life experience under your belt, and then do a psychotherapy masters. Being a bit older is beneficial in starting therapy training - you will have a better chance of being accepted, and you won't be younger than pretty much all the clients. ",

If you are not fond of psychological research and have no experience doing research, it will be very difficult to get into a clinical psych PhD program in the US.\n\nThe main difference between a master’s and a PhD comes down to scope and time. A master’s (like counseling or social work) will get you into the field quicker (about 2 years), you can still have a private practice, but you probably won’t be teaching college courses or doing formal testing (although you can teach college classes at the adjunct level, but you won't achieve full professorship). PhDs take longer (4-6 years) and are more research-focused, but they give you more flexibility if you want to teach, publish, or eventually specialize more deeply.\n\nI think a common misconception is that you have to have a specialty before entering grad school. If you’re not totally sure what your specialty is yet, that’s okay. A lot of people figure that out through work or field experience. You can have an idea of what you want to do, but you will never know until you truly experience  it, which is why I would recommend getting some working experience in mental health before making the decision to go to school. If you’re able to work or volunteer in a psych-related setting before committing, it’ll probably give you a clearer sense of what kind of program fits your goals.\n\nI write a free newsletter for psych students and career changers where I talk about these kinds of decisions and how to find your direction without rushing into more school.

Deciding your future before you’re even an established adult is the best part. \n\nJokes aside, check out the pinned post to the subreddit. There’s a document that breaks down all the graduate degree, wrote by one of the mods. It’s a fantastic source. \n\nBut your understanding of what these degrees do aren’t necessarily accurate. PhD is a research degree. So if you don’t intend or want to do any research, reconsider looking to achieve one of the hardest degrees possible. You can teach and practice at a master’s level. Yeah, you likely won’t become a “professor,” because this title is coveted, and only for researchers. Ask any PhD if they are more proud of “professor” or “Doctor.” \n\nYou don’t need to be a professor to teach though. Most faculty who teach aren’t professors, but rather “teaching faculty” or “guest instructor.” There’s a few variations of the name. Basically people contracted with the university to teach. This allows the professors to focus on administrative work or even better, research. You can become an instructor with a masters degree. \n\nKeep in mind though, you’ll likely be teaching at smaller schools. 4 year schools are swamped in applications of very qualified nerds. So much so, they can pick and choose decent PhDs to keep on the payroll as instructors until the school finds a need to bring them on board as a tenured professor, or just axe them and move on. It’s not fantastic of the PhDs to be held in this limbo. But it exists, and will be why Masters degrees will be overlooked pretty often at larger schools.\n\nEdit: Forgot to also add the poor saps that are PhD students who are also paid to work as instructors without a masters or a PhD.

Clubs are nice to have but will not make up the bulk of your academic CV when applying to graduate schools. It'll be research experiences. \n\nSo I would try to join a lab at your college doing psychology research related to the area you want to research during your graduate studies. Sometimes neuroscience based labs might do psychology adjacent research. Sometimes computer science or even biology. The priority is getting into a lab, accumulating experience and understanding what research is about. If your school has an honors program join that too (which usually entails writing an undergraduate honor's thesis -- a research paper on a project that you do with an advisor and could potentially be published). \n\nLastly the quality of your research experience matters. It's one thing to have volunteered as an assistant and done data collection VERSUS having done data collection on top of analysis on top of presenting a poster at a conference on top of helping writing a section of the manuscript (research paper) itself.\n\nI would start searching through the Professors/faculty at your institution and checking their profiles or googling their names to see the type of research they do and if you find someone you'd like to work with, email them with your interest in volunteering as a research assistant or approach them during their office hours.\n\nThere are also often undergraduate summer research programs (REUs) that you can also do over the summer which are often paid research experiences at a top R1 university. There's a few international ones depending on where you live. But I only know of one's based in the USA. Hope this helps. :)",

Failure of insurance reimbursements to keep up with inflation (my hourly rate hasn’t been able to change in almost 8 years in spite of the out of control inflation) and more and more AI providing “therapy” and eventually squeezing out humans in at least some settings, are two immediate things that you should think carefully about. I don’t think the bots will have all our jobs in the next 5 years, but the landscape looks bleak for therapists in private practice over the 30+ year arc. Once insurance companies decide they’ll only cover the costs of patients using apps or AI systems, we’re fucked (in my case, the doctorate will allow me to do many other things if that happens, but if you’re only doing a masters then your options would be more limited).\n\nRTs do such important, amazing work, and you can find a job almost anywhere. I’m sure some of that will be more automated in the future but probably a much slower pace than therapy. \n\nSo… maybe RT? And keep psychology as a passion?",

I kept taking a year off to work full time and then going back so my college life has been very sporadic. 24 is still so young we have so much time to figure it out. \n\nit ultimately depends on what’s more important to you, being financially stable sooner or studying and working towards something that interests you and you’re passionate about. I started off as a business major which would have gotten me easy money if I stuck with it but I hateeee business which is why I decided to make the sudden change to psych. I have a stable part time job with flexible hours and I’m not being pressured to move out of my parents house or anything so I’m lucky in that regard to have people to support me while I navigate school. my goal is to get a lot of research experience during my bachelors so when I’m going for my masters I can get a job as a TA or paid RA or something to keep building my resume for my doctorate (which I need to be a board certified psychologist). then once I get my masters I want to go into therapy or counselling while I study for my PhD because those jobs are kind of well paid in my area.\n\nI understand it all depends on personal situations and it may not all go according to plan but that’s just to point out that you can still make some money while studying in your field. now if your situation unfortunately won’t allow you to wait 7-8 years to be financially stable then logically you may need to go for respiratory therapist. but if you can comfortably study psychology while staying slightly financially stable and you stop caring about “falling behind” due to still being in school, then I say go for it, the time is going to pass anyway so might as well spend it doing something worth your time.\n\nTLDR ultimately it depends on you, your situation and your needs!",

But also, Pavlov wasn’t the only inspiration for Watson. Research focused around more objective measures was where functionalists like James Angell (Watson’s PhD supervisor) were going anyway, and you get things like Edward Thorndike’s ‘Law of Effect’ - reinforcement, basically - which is present in his 1898 thesis.",

If you're looking to do research, testing, teaching, then the PhD route is favorable, although much more time consuming and competitive. \n\nI'm one to value getting some experience in the psych field before making the decision to go to grad school. I think one thing you could focus on in the short term is getting some working experience to ensure you'd really like to go down this path, you can enjoy learning about it (as many people do with psychology), but practicing is an entirely different ballgame. \n\nIt’s not too late at all—you just may need to take a slightly longer road to make sure you’re well-prepared and confident in the path you choose.\n\nI write a free weekly newsletter for psych students where I talk about transitions like this, how to build experience, and what grad schools are really looking for.

      "content": "Didn’t know whether to mark it as “sad” or “vent,” bc it’s a sad vent. Basically the title. She told me years ago to go into sports medicine. I am a creative. I found my path to medicine rather organically and non-traditionally. Found my purpose. Fell in love with it. Worked my ass off and got accepted. Now my mother will not attend my white coat ceremony. \nWhy? \nI honestly don’t know, but my suspicion is because of an argument I had with my older sister. I feel like she should not be involved in my interpersonal relationships with my siblings, but for some reason when I argue with this specific sister, my mother will immediately text me in my sister’s defense while tearing me down completely. In one of our last convos before I took the MCAT she told me I would make a horrible doctor. She told me this because my sister hung up the phone on me. I still don’t understand why she hung up the phone. She said my voice triggered her, whatever that means to her. I do not yell at people so I’m not sure what I did or said to cause that reaction. \n\nLast December I flew across the country to see and spend time with her on her birthday. Last minute, she canceled. She refused to see me the entire 5 days I was home. She also refused to let me spend time with my 13 year old sister. \n\nThis Mother’s Day, knowing she’d recently moved, I asked for her new address so I could send a gift. She gave me the address of one of my siblings, and her gift was accidentally given to my grandma (her ex-MIL) who was staying with my sister at the time. My mom is now angry that I will not send a duplicate gift. \n\nMy siblings who depend on her (there are many of us) also “cannot attend” the ceremony for whatever reasons they have, despite most flying across the country for another siblings’ undergrad graduation. Idk, it’s very cult-like the way my family works. Like an inner circle and an outer one. \n\nAnyway, this is getting long. And I am sad. But maybe it is for the best. She would find a way to make it about her. Or maybe I am sour-graping. Idk. ",

      "title": "Love letter to reapplicants no.2",
      "content": "Last year around this time, I received my last post-II decision, an R from my in-state school. I was distraught and frankly, felt like I was a failure for having to reapply the following cycle (side note: you are NOT a failure for reapplying). I was in an inconsolable place, but found some solace after reading u/pumpkpie_chem's love letter reddit post. My hope is to also encourage other fellow reapplicants out there that the journey doesn't end, and it will be okay in the end. (I'm writing this on a whim, so hopefully it's not too disorganized.)\n\nLast cycle, I was on my third gap year and felt that I had done everything in my power to prepare for a strong application. Some more info: ORM, 510-515 MCAT, 3.7 GPA, 4th Q Casper (low preview like 3?), some service-heavy activities, 3000 hrs of research, and longitudinal experiences (you can message me for more details). I applied to almost 50 MD schools (latest complete mid Aug), and threw a few DO in as well, albeit I applied 'late' for DO (complete mid/late Oct). I had done some prior research on making a balanced school list using MSAR, had collected various LORs from my mentors/professors who I felt close with, and delved deep into crafting a PS that I felt was representative of me. Looking back, I did try to have a quick turnaround for secondaries, but ended up submitting many 3-4 weeks afterwards and even later than that due to a family vacation that was veryyy ill-timed. In the end, I received 2 II's: one from my in-state flagship in early September, and another top 20 CA school in December. I was ecstatic for them, but the latter ended in a WL with low hopes of getting off (iykyk which school), and the former a formal R, after being ghosted for 8 months... Each passing day in May felt like torment to me—refreshing SDN every hour, contemplating what further I could do to possibly get off the WL, and basically spiraling. For those who are on WLs, I'm sure you can relate. The unknown felt terrifying.\n\nIn the end, I realized I had to cut my losses for that WL (I'm all or nothing, and it was wiser to redirect my emotional energy fretting into crafting a better reapplication). I decided to go all in to reapply one last time, since AMCAS was open to submit soon. I would say I like to plan for worst-case scenarios... So earlier that February, I had already decided to transition out of my MA role into clinical research, just in case I needed to reapply (you don't have to change roles, but medical schools do generally like to see applicant growth and I felt this was the right choice for me). I did some serious reflection in therapy to address WHY I felt this upset over reapplying, sought advice online, as well as considered whether my application had any unknown red flags that I hadn't considered. I realized that I felt deep shame for having to reapply, because I felt I was \"behind\" some unspoken timeline and failed myself/others. I'd already pushed back my gap years from 1 > 2 due to COVID and health issues, 2 > 3 due to MCAT struggles, and now it would've been 4 gap years (2 planned, and 2 unplanned). I felt even worse when I considered that my classmates from my alma mater (tier 1 school) all seemed to have successful cycles, and many were already even graduating soon! I wanted to crawl into my own shell when I realized I ALSO had to ask my professors to update my LOR, and that I'd have to explain that I'm reapplying. Tbh, that realization felt the worse for me, because I felt that I'd let my mentors down as well.\n\nEventually, I got over the self-pity and decided that I could only move forward; perhaps this would be a redirection for me. I attended some applicant feedback sessions (from my state school), which was helpful in confirming that I didn't have any red flags, but that I probably just didn't \"stand out\" enough. I was VERY torn whether I needed to make major changes to my reapplication since I'd heard that as standard advice, but I'm also very glad I trusted my gut. I made minimal changes to my reapplication, because I believed that it was a matter of FRAMING and presenting myself, and not about the content of my activities or stats. At the core, my \"why medicine\" hadn't changed and I felt it disingenuous to myself to *completely* revamp my application.\n\nSo this cycle, I only changed my healthcare job and my essays (I also applied to 5-10 more schools than last cycle). I worked extremely hard to re-package myself in a way that I felt showed growth, as well as sincere passion and commitment for EACH medical school. These two efforts made a HUGE difference imo. Off the bat, I received 5 MD II's (a couple low tier, one mid-tier, and the others T30) and 4 DO's, with A's to both (though 4/5 of my MD ones ended in WLs, which I withdrew from). I am very grateful that the A I received is actually really close to home for me. When I was younger (not that I'm old), I really wanted to spread my wings far and live further away from family (I did this is undergrad and it wasn't what I imagined lol). But as I've grown, I realized that it's ideal for me personally to be near a support system. Here are some takeaways I've learned as a reapplicant (please take it with a grain of salt, as it's n=1 sample size):\n\n1. MISSION FIT MATTERS. I realized too late that schools genuinely really care to select for the applicant they feel is the \"right fit\" for them. They're usually split between \"research heavy\" and \"service heavy\" schools. My first cycle (2023-24), I had thought I could have my cake and eat it too (I had what I believed to be a lot of research and service), so I didn't intentionally try to cater to either. I tried to market myself as well rounded, and in the end appeared lackluster (well-rounded is good, but be careful with overly appealing to every school). This cycle, I reflected more deeply what my strengths were, and focused on schools that were service-oriented as they aligned more with my values and person. I made it extremely clear in my writing my goals/vision to continue service-related work as a med student and future physician.\n2. ESSAYS are so under-rated. People like to say that you can't have a truly bad or good essay, and the majority are just okay. While that may be true, please don't discredit them. Do NOT plug and chug a template into chatGPT or deepseek and copy-paste into each secondary. I know applying to a broad school list makes it daunting to write everything uniquely, but it will help if you seriously take the TIME to do research about each school, present genuine reasons for WHY you truly like x school, and write from your heart. I was guilty of trying to speedrun essays in my first cycle, and I think that truly hurt my application.\n   1. Schools can tell when you do not care for their mission or unique offerings, and it's more obvious than you'd expect to be able to tell from an applicant's writing tone if they've done their due diligence or not. Some things I did differently included signing up for info sessions and attending them (schools often go into way more detail about their curriculum and mission etc during these), interacting/asking Q's with current students, attending any events from their social media posts, etc. These can help you be more genuine/specific about what specifically you're excited about for x school. Let's be real, many schools have an integrated or flipped classroom curriculum, with distinction tracks, and study abroad programs... As an applicant, you can definitely dig even deeper to find something that resonates with you for why you're PERSONALLY excited to attend x school.\n   2. Additionally, I used flowery language my first cycle. Please don't do that unless you think you can do it well; I imagine adcoms after reading their 10,000th essay would be exhausted from the same overly-sycophantic style of writing. I decided to write sincerely and more straightforward this cycle. I tried to be more clear with my writing and I think it helped greatly (idk if this applies to others, but I do know I struggle with being roundabout).\n3. Craft a good school list (make sure to have more target schools than reaches). There are many resources out there to help with that. An applicant pitfall is applying to too many schools that have low-yield (ex. Georgetown, Drexel), in-state heavy preference (ex. many state schools heavily prefer in state people, most notorious is UW since they usually require WWAMI), service heavy schools without the hours to back it up (ex. Rush, Loyola), or just having too many top tier schools (ex. HYP). I found MSAR to be helpful in seeing the ratio of OOS:IS, applicant and matriculant GPA and MCAT ranges. Be careful applying to too many that your stats are in the lowest or out-of-range percentile (ofc you can apply, but be wary that there's a reason schools have a range and most successful matriculants generally do fall within that range). Additionally, there are a few Jesuit schools (Georgetown, Loyola, SLU, Creighton), so be aware that they often focus on person-centered care/cura personalis. \n   1. I've noticed that many schools tout they're open to OOS, but be wary that more often than not, many schools do genuinely care more for applicants who have local ties or are connected somehow to them. For ex, I believe partly why I received a good midwest MD II was I had some minimal ties to the area. At the end of the day, med schools like to retain their med graduates in the area, so there's reason for them to filter applicants partially based on their likelihood to stay and serve the locale.\n4. PS: I didn't change much for my personal statement this time around, because I believed that my core reason for pursuing medicine hadn't changed. I had already gone through 4-5 iterations of edits last cycle, so I only made minimal edits this reapplication cycle (like 1-2 sentences changed). This may not be true for everyone, so I encourage reapplicants to dig deeper for possible ways to improve! I just wanted to give an example to others that every situation is different.\n5. LORs can be slightly dated. I actually attempted to reach out to all my advisors and was ghosted by my undergrad PI (of 3.5 years) as well as my attending... It was very awkward and I was extremely worried that having a 1-2 year old LOR would hurt my chances. I submitted anyway (with some updated LORs and a couple old ones), and it seems to have went okay! I think realistically, every applicant will have some strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay not to be neurotic over making everything \"perfect.\"\n6. Be wary of \"new\" vs. old reapplied schools! I know people before me have had great luck with reapplying to the SAME schools they did their first cycle as schools often welcome reapplicants. However, I was worried so this time around, I was careful to split about 50/50 with my school list (half old schools, half new schools) in case I would somehow be \"penalized\" for reapplying. Actually, I'm really glad I did this because that old adage has not been the case for me sadly... Most of my II's were actually from \"new\" ones that I hadn't applied to previously. Only one low tier MD interviewed me this cycle that I'd applied to last year. The school I'm attending was a new one I added last minute lol. Additionally, I believe that some schools interview applicants on the cusp sometimes with minimal/no intention of giving them an A, barring extreme circumstances. This is only my opinion, but I interviewed at a few top 20 schools with lower stats as an ORM, and was placed on all WLs. I think schools may give you a chance based on your life story or mission fit, but do be careful overextending hope on getting off certain WLs (like be cautiously hopeful). \n\n7. Make sure your story is cohesive. It should make sense to adcoms how one activity/life event has led you to another, and ultimately to medicine. Your AMCAS activities, PS, and secondaries should clarify WHY medicine, but also prove to adcoms that you are certain this path is for you. They want to know you've done your due diligence to ascertain what this path entails (as it's long, often gruelsome work, and is a heavy investment), as well as ensure you are ready for the rigors of school and standardized testing. Your job as an applicant is to somehow prove/show them that you know what you're getting yourself into.\n8. IIs. Usually they're MMI or traditional. Interestingly, in my last cycle, my two IIs were MMI-based. And during my post-interview feedback, the director of admissions noted that ONE of my stations didn't quite like my answer for MMI :( I was surprised since the common saying is that interviewers just want to hear your reasoning and there's no \"right\" or \"wrong\" answer. After interviewing 10+ schools cumulatively, I will say that I've noticed that while that can be true, interviewers are still human and they may resonate more or less with certain answers you have.. I previously read the MMI book by Desai and it was helpful for me, however I can't say much about it since this cycle, my As were all from traditional interviews lol... It's possible that I just really suck at MMI or it's a fluke, but regardless, I highly encourage (re)applicants to be cautious about how you portray your answers and I think practice for MMI can help. I think as a non-trad, my strength was traditional interviews since I'd already worked various jobs prior and am very familiar with how to do well in it. For traditional interviews, be human; it's okay to make jokes or even be awkward! Adcoms know it's stressful so there's no need to overly rehearse your answers (be sure to know why med, why doctor, tell me about yourself, why this school).\n\nI'm sure there's more stuff but these are all I can think of now. If this can help one person, I will feel it was more than worth! Again, these are my own thoughts so take everything with a grain of salt.\n\nI sometimes get bummed that it took me more years than my peers (which is more of a me issue that I want to address in therapy lol), however I do truly believe that things fall into place for a reason. If I had gotten in last cycle, I would've been ill-prepared because I was recovering from an intensive surgery and couldn't physically move/be a student. I've recovered since then and feel I've come a long way in this last year (I'm grateful for the added year I had to spend with family and friends as well, and explore my early to mid 20s). Have faith in yourself, and know that it's not over until it's truly over. As one mentor once said to me, \"it's a long becoming process.\" \n\nMy DM's are open and I'll try my best to answer any questions :) Good luck future applicants and reapplicants! I believe you can do this <3 ",

I write about giving test results and helping with treatment adherence alongside the patient’s physician.\n\nI just went through some existing posts on this subreddit and a few mentioned how it’s a red flag to describe giving results (especially HIV) to patients since such a task should be reserved for an actual provider. I will say most of these posts described doing this job in a volunteer capacity with just a screening test but I’m an actual employee at the clinic I’m doing this at. I’m certified as an HIV counselor and as a phlebotomist, so I conduct the screening test as well as the confirmatory test and deliver the results for each on my own. I then set up the patient to meet with the provider and work with the provider during the appt to ensure treatment adherence and continuance of care (Dr handles more clinical stuff and I do more case manager-like tasks at that point). \n\nIn my statement, I made sure to explicitly state that I delivered test results. Not just told someone they had HIV or diagnosed them because I know that is something the provider formally does. \n\nIs it ok to have it in my statement if framed like that? If not, does anyone have advice on how to go about writing this in a more appropriate way. I don’t think I can write a genuine statement without including this.  \n",

This cycle was wild, and I never expected to have success!\n\nQuick recap of everything, I submitted within the first week of June, and I took my MCAT in the last week of May so I applied not knowing what score I would have! (although I only initially included Stanford as a reach/throwaway school in case things didn’t go my way). Once I got my score back, I decided to take a risk and apply to basically no safety schools. I thought that even if 1 school out of all of these were to accept me, I would be over the moon, so I shot my shot! Once I started receiving secondaries, I submitted most of them within a week (make sure to prewrite!) and some before 2 weeks. \n\nI think I received a good number of interviews because of my writing, I was brutally honest about myself and my motivations, and was extremely personal/vulnerable in them. For my interview preparation, I did the basic stuff most people do, but I made sure to let my personality shine through in every interview. I would make interviewers laugh, get them to talk about their lives, and most of the time it felt like a conversation with a friend rather than an interview. \n\nI was also extremely lucky. With my low research hours, I really took a gamble with these schools, and if I could do it all over again I would definitely get involved with research a lot earlier. The amount of mentors that guided me through the process from physicians, medical students, loved ones, and friends was also imperative for my success, don’t underestimate the power of a strong network! \n\nStill salty about the Harvard R, but it looks like I will most likely be going to UCSF! If anyone has any questions regarding what to do during undergrad, MCAT prep (since I tutor the MCAT now), the application cycle, or gap years, feel free to comment or message me. \n\nTo all of my URM applicants, we need you in this field so keep on going!\n\n¡Si se pudo!\n\n\n\n(stats for those interested)\n\n\n\nURM (Latino)\n\n1 Gap Year\n\nFirst Gen Disadvantaged\n\n**Clinical**\n\nEM: 900 hrs\n\nInterpreter: 350 hrs\n\nMental Health Technician: 500 hrs\n\nGap Year Hours: 2000 hrs divided between EMT and Mental Health\n\n**Non-Clinical**\n\nCommunity Volunteer: 750 hrs\n\n**Research**\n\nED Research: 80 hrs\n\n**Shadowing**\n\n40 hrs across EM and FM\n\n**Leadership**\n\nHead Tutor: 200 hrs\n\nClinic Chair: 100 hrs\n\n**Other Employment**\n\nTutoring: 550 hrs\n\nWorkshop Worker: 300 hrs\n\n**Hobbies**\n\nVarious Fitness and musical-related hobbies\n\n",

Prior to my IA I had a GPA of 3.6.  I didn’t have any IA against me when I was applying (and have no history of ever committing any type of academic dishonesty in any level of academia before this), so when I filled out my application (in summer ‘24), I clicked ‘no’ to the IA question on all 3 platforms.\n\n\n\nWhen October ‘24 came around, I had my second midterms of the semester, but I was sick, and keep in mind I am a college student. I went to the campus clinic multiple times to check for an opening, and every time they kept saying they did not have any appointments till the next week. I couldn’t go to an ER clinic because I’m a broke college student, and I ended up sending a falsified excused absence note to the professor. The professor accepted it first, but then decided to call and check with the clinic if I have ever been a patient, and if I had been seen. The clinic denied, and the professor informed me that I would be contacted by the honor system office regarding the case that was being opened against me. I got the notification later that year (mid November) that I had 4 charges being brought against me (Falsification, Forgery, Cheating, and Violation of Department/College Rules), and met with the representative of the office to discuss the incident. She notified me that their department was behind on cases, and that I would most likely have my hearing in the spring (of ‘25). One thing to note, also, is that in early November, I got a notification (on the TMDSAS portal, not on my email) that one of my Letters of Evaluation had been rejected due to not having a date on the letter. I immediately called up the professor, asked him to please reupload it while on the phone (while trying to hide my frustration) and uploaded it to TMDSAS (but atp it was the end of the application cycle and my chances of getting a texas school interview were cooked).\n\n\n\nFast forward to Spring ‘25, I have a meeting with the Honor System Office to explain my side of the case, and then in February I have my hearing. I attended it, and immediately out the gate, they ask me if I accept the charges or not, and explained that I have no choice but to accept the charges, which I ended up doing (I accepted the charges because I DID demonstrate a lack of integrity, but I still think that I should have had more guidance from the office on the process of the whole academic integrity case). Regardless, the council talked through the whole hearing, then imposed a 2 semester suspension immediately,  after which I would have to reapply (but there is no guarantee of admission, nor does it say anywhere what my chances are), along with 2 academic integrity courses that I would have to complete once I return to the university. \n\n\n\nHowever, the university has an appeals process that would allow me to appeal the decision of the hearing and alter the sanctions, given that my appeal statement gives a valid enough reason to warrant one. I wrote an appeal, and outlined that this is my first IA of any type, that this was a slip up that happened due to a dozen different factors in which everything in my life was crumbling around me, and more. The appeal got approved, which gave me a glimmer of hope, and I was scheduled to have a hearing later in the semester.\n\n\n\nThen, in March ‘25 (right in the middle of my spring break lol), I got a notification that my appeals hearing would be the following week. I went to my appeals hearing, and they decided to uphold the sanctions the original council had placed. \n\n\n\nHowever, during the time in between when my initial hearing happened, my appeal that was approved made it so that I had no IA against me (I made sure with the representative from the office). During the time I had in between my two hearings, I applied to 5 more DO schools because I read that they had extended their application cycle due to an issue with the AACOMAS system. However, at this time, I still did not have any institutional action against me, so I put no, and submitted my application. I ended up getting secondaries from 4, submitted those in March. \n\n\n\nNow, after my second hearing, the sanctions were upheld, and I am currently suspended from the university until Dec. 31^(st), 2025. (My GPA is now 3.4 because of the F in the course sanction.) However, in April, I got two interviews from that group of DO schools that I applied to in the Feb-Mar period, and I attended the first one (via zoom), and I got my first A! Previously, I had gotten two MD interviews and one DO interview, and I got waitlisted at one MD and one DO.\n\n\n\nHowever, I was supposed to graduate in May of 2025, and that's the whole reason why I applied in summer ‘24. I didn’t end up graduating (because of the IA), and as a result have an acceptance to a DO school, but no bachelors degree in hand.\n\n\n\nThis is where I am now, because I got my acceptance letter (quite literally) the day before I am posting this. Do I ask for a deferment, or do I not enroll, or what do I do? I also have one more irl interview next week that I will be traveling to (for the other DO school), but I don’t know if it is worth going. I am currently registered for a few more science courses (both to lift my sGPA and cGPA) and am also looking for a research job. I am also considering getting a MRI tech certification or something similar so that if I somehow get into med school, then I can pay for it, or if I am cooked regarding med school then I can at least develop my career into that path. I do really want to go to med school, but it's looking really really bleak right now. Also what are my chances of even getting back into my school to complete my degree in the first place?\n\n\n\nps. Transferring schools isn’t an option, because I am unable to send my official transcript outside of my current university as part of my sanctions.   \n  \nTLDR: OP was on track to graduate undergrad in Spring 2025 and applied to med schools in Summer 2024 with no institutional action (IA) on record. In Fall 2024, they submitted a fake excused absence note to delay a midterm and got caught, leading to four academic integrity charges. After a hearing in Spring 2025, they were suspended for two semesters. They appealed and were temporarily IA-free, during which they applied to more DO schools and received interviews. One led to an acceptance. However, after the final hearing, the original sanctions were upheld, and they remain suspended until the end of 2025—meaning no bachelor’s degree before med school. They now face a dilemma: ask to  defer med school for a year, not enroll, or try another path (like MRI tech). Transferring is not an option due to transcript restrictions. They're asking for advice and feel stuck, remorseful, and uncertain about their future.\n\n  \n",

      "content": "Hi, I was wondering if anyone had any input for how I can edit this school list that [admit.org](http://admit.org) gave me. I think it's unrealistic given my background. I was originally only going to apply for TX schools since I'm in Texas, but I was told by a doctor it's not a good idea if I don't increase the number of schools I'm applying to, so here I am. I've already submitted to TMDSAS, but I don't know what to choose for AMCAS. Below is some info:\n\n* ORM, cGPA 3.99/sGPA 4.0\n* MCAT 525\n* Only just started to work in a lab for the next 12 months, so veeery little research hours right now.\n* \\~250 hospital volunteering hours\n* \\~125 shadowing hours\n* \\~250 non-clinical volunteering, kinda unique\n* \\~350 hours teaching outreach music group classes to public school children\n* Employment: played in 3 different professional orchestras, currently working as private music instructor\n* Extracurriculars/hobbies: \\~19000 hrs of individual music practice, \\~3000 hrs chamber music, 500 hrs at summer music intensives, recently started to practice chinese calligraphy again.\n* Nontrad: went to conservatory from high school through master's for classical music perf\n* Have ties to chicago, cincinnati, and NC.\n\nI think my biggest weakness right now is lack of research and clinical experience. Also I don't have 2 LORs from science professors due to my circumstances, but the one from my music professor is really strong. My dream school is UT Long, and I don't want to go out of state unless the school is giving me some good reason to leave TX. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated. Thanks so much!",

      "content": "I've been a long-time lurker on this subreddit. I've seen, over the years, many people here with amazing GPAs getting into amazing schools (congrats guys!) and it makes me really regret the approach I took towards undergrad. College was a huge transition for me as I moved internationally, and so I had a lot of struggles that contributed to my mid performance. I moved from a different country where I did all of my schooling. I didn't have any family members who went through the US education system, no doctors or health professionals in my ENTIRE family, and had very little premed advising for most of my college career. So I jumped right into my classes without having the right support (or knowing where to get it).\n\nI definitely prioritized extracurricular activities during my college career, and while I now have a lot of hours stacked up and have some amazing experiences, my GPA needs to be repaired after struggling in virtually every single STEM course I took until junior year and almost failing a class. I'm fortunate to have a family that emotionally and financially supports my decision to continue trying hard by going to an SMP/master's this year, but I really, REALLY regret not prioritizing how to form good study techniques and spending hours and hours of my week on other activities. Now I have to work SUPER hard to do well in the SMP/master's for it to offset my undergrad GPA and I'm super stressed about it. AND it's expensive as hell. I wish I were applying this year like most other people I know.\n\nTo everyone on this subreddit who has a lower GPA, you CAN get it up. You CAN still go to med school if you pick yourself up. But please don't make the same mistake that I did of not prioritizing studying well, especially in freshman year. If you feel like something is in your way of doing that, like an organization that takes up 10 hours per week, drop it. It is okay. It will not matter in the long run and you can always come back to these orgs/activities as you develop confidence in your academic abilities. Stellar experiences are very valuable, of course, but do NOT underestimate the value of your GPA.",

Is this a red flag for med school applications? Will schools value my research experience, and how should I approach building my application list?\n\nAlso, I plan to take a gap year to study for the MCAT while working part-time to gain more clinical experience. I’m hoping to find a job where I can work with patients but also stay involved in research related to my work. Does anyone have suggestions?\n\nThanks in advance!",

I'm still in shock. It's been such a stressful process, from getting WL after WL, to planning to reapply, to almost having to CTE to my first A, to finally being accepted at my top choice. \n\nFor those also on WL's or who may be in this situation in future cycles, my only advice is to try and forget about it all. As much as you can. Come to terms with attending your current acceptance or look forward to creating a killer reapplication. There are positives in any situation. Maybe your school is really good at XYZ, or maybe you will get into an amazing school next year, making it worth the wait. I know when people told me \"Don't worry you'll get off one,\" that just made me worry more. I found it best to really forget about it all and just enjoy the present. Also, you shouldn't even be reading this because this subreddit will destroy your mental state in every way possible. \n\nP.S. shoutout to all the people on here who help with writing and application tips without charge, you guys are the gems of this community and I wouldn't be where I am without ya'll",

I actually already got admitted into a T50 last year but that's not prestigious enough for me so I turned it down and am applying again, haha! Here's my stats:\n\n* Decent GPA, except I cheated on all my pre-med requisites. I actually failed my first semester of college but THANK GOD Covid-19 happened! All my classes went online for 3 semesters and I squeezed all my pre-med reqs in. I paid people to take all my virtual exams for me so even though my overall GPA isn't awesome, at least my pre-med reqs look great! Just don't ask me to name the 20 amino acids, because I can't :)\n* URM except I'm actually ORM. I'm actually ORM but my private high school sent me on a spring break trip to Latin America and I really liked it! So now I put myself down only as Latino on my applications. I also recently did a 23andme and found out I'm 0.01% Indigenous, so I'm definitely checking myself down as that too!\n* I won a few research scholarships specifically for URM students. In case you were wondering if lying about being URM would actually impact me, it didn't. I applied for a few research scholarships during college and lied about my race/ethnicity in the past and won them! I actually hated DEI, but now I like it because I found out it can benefit me, yay!\n* I'm now getting my master's at a top grad school. I actually chat-GPTed my essays and got in, I think all the URM research scholarships I got really carried me! I'm hoping the prestige of my grad school will make med schools ignore the fact that my stats, even after all that cheating, are still below their averages. Hopefully lying about being URM will let me steal a spot from someone actually disadvantaged!\n* I'm a HUGE advocate for mental health, women's rights, public health, and whatever else med schools like. I actually used to bully people for having depression and got in trouble because I said women should be in the kitchen :( but then I found out that helping the underserved is actually favored by med schools so I switched up senior year. Go health disparities!\n\nAnyways, let me know what my chances are of getting into all the T5 schools! I actually might just apply to the T10s because even the T20s is too low for someone of my level.\n\n(In case you missed the flair this is NOT about me. But surprise! This is an actual profile (and mindset) of someone I know who is planning to apply this cycle.)",

Since if I send my application to schools right after getting verified, the soonest most of my secondaries would come is beginning of July, but I essentially would be forced to wait to submit for like 4 weeks because of the MCAT score. **Would it be better to send my primary application a little later in July, just so I’m in the 2 week range by July 29th- or is it better for schools to receive a primary application as early as possible, even if it means sitting on a secondary for close to a month?**",

I’m tempted to wait and fill out my EC’s a bit better and show myself as a more well rounded applicant in order to go for more competitive MD schools (I’m thinking about going into surgery and don’t know if competitive medical schools will make a difference vs. mid-tier medical schools). \n\nI’m fortunate to have family that knows a good bit about the medical field and they’re urging me to apply this cycle because they feel that the way you in excel in any medical school matters more than where you go. That being said, I think I came to the realization a bit late that I want to go to these higher ranking schools and I feel that doing a bit more to solidify my application. \n\nThey are supportive of that and are urging me to apply anyways and if I don’t get in this cycle, then I can still do all the other things I want to do to reinforce the application anyways. I think my main question for y’all is should I bother applying this cycle and try anyways, or just wait entirely for next year? Is there any downside to applying once and not getting in or is it worth it to try?",

If you did get into a school on the list, most likely you also got into Penn or JHU or Mount Sinai and I'm sure you wouldn't  have a WAMC post here because most likely something you wrote would doxx you .\n\nIt's important to access the track record of applicants from your undergraduate school. According to AAMC, there were 418 applicants from Rutgers in 2023-2024 cycle. Out of those, 3 matriculated at NYU, one matriculated at JHU, one matriculated at Penn, one matriculated at Mount Sinai, one matriculated at WashU, 2 matriculated at Cornell, and one matriculated at Northwestern. In total, 10 matriculated at a so-called T20.\n\nNo one says you are not entitled to applying to your dream schools but just like you can't make a living buying lottery tickets, you need to make a school list with your head and not with your heart if you goal is to get into A school.

I just started my research on it now and was wondering if any students who’ve gone through their certification could tell me how you felt during and after the experience. How much did it cost you to get your certification and do you think it was worth it? Working in an ambulance crew currently seems like the best way to learn and experience the ups and downs of helping people medically while still being in undergrad.

At this stage of my life though, I am wondering if it's best to just stay put with the way things are and not pursue medicine. I don't fall into the category of \"i hate my job , medicine will be so much better\" blah blah. I understand the process of becoming a doctor and for me right now, that's doing a content review and then taking a diagnostic MCAT to see where things really are. I'm frustrated because I feel like I have so many other things demanding my time and attention, that I just don't see how studying even while being super efficient would end up being worthwhile for me. I understand many of these feelings are super subjective and truly only something my wife and I can answer together.

      "content": "I graduated with my bachelors in Bio in 2024, and I thought I would be ready to apply this year going into my second gap year (right? Is that how gap years are counted? Lmao) My app isn’t stellar, it’s average. Even with the gap years I haven’t accumulated that many hours (500 clinical, 450 research, 200 non-clinical, 35 shadowing). 3.65 cGPA and 3.56 sGPA. My biggest hurdle, however, has been the mcat. No matter what I do, I can’t break 500. I’ve honestly lost track of how many times I’ve rescheduled it, and I just feel so overwhelmed at this point. I’ve taken like six 3rd party fls (scored 495-499), the AAMC unscored sample (497), and FL1 (489). Yup, my score went down instead of going up. I feel so exhausted and disappointed in myself. I haven’t studied in the past two weeks and my mcat is on June 14th which is in about 2 weeks. I stopped taking fls because I felt that I wasn’t studying well enough to do good on them, so my latest score is the 489 from FL1. I can’t help but feel like a failure for taking a third gap year even if it means improving my app. I don’t think gap years are bad and I would never think less of anyone who took many gap years. I just hate myself ig lol and I just really want to start med school already. I’m tired of waiting, it feels like my life is on hold. But the only person to blame here is me. To make matters worse, I haven’t even started my personal statement. I’m very embarrassed to admit that. I feel like I have already given up… all I need to do is cancel my mcat or reschedule, but without the intention of applying on time this cycle. I’m not asking for mcat advice, I’m just wondering if I’m making the right choice. IF I even have a choice, because I don’t even think it’s possible for me to study effectively and improve significantly in the next two weeks. \n\n\n**Edit to add that I want to do MD in case I want to specialize. People have suggested DO before, but whenever I mention that I’m not 100% sure I’d attend DO, they tell me to not apply DO. I’m taking that advice. ",

It really is a tough process, but if this truly is your passion, then it will be worth it! For those uncertain if medicine is actually for you, take your time. I found out it was for me in my sophomore year of college, and only then started working for it. Good luck you all.✌️\n\n",

I’m applying this cycle and tested on 4/4. I didn’t do as well as I would’ve liked on the MCAT, 509 (124/128/127/130). I’m decently happy with every section score except c/p. Chem is a huge weakness for me (and it’s a pattern in my grades as well). When my score came out, a friend suggested retaking this summer and continuing with my application for the cycle. My premed advisor said she wouldn’t recommend it bc it’s a risky move and I wouldn’t be applying as early as possible anymore and said that if I wanted to retake, I should do another gap year. I don’t want to do another gap year so I listened to her and now I am regretting it. I really want to retake because I know I can do better but considering how little time there is, I’m scared that I’ll do the same or worse without ample time. I should’ve started studying again much earlier and I regret that now. I guess I’m asking if my score is good enough to apply with (and do I have a good/decent chance?) or should I just retake ASAP? I’m applying broadly MD and DO but MD preferred although I’m happy with DO as well. I’d really appreciate any insights/advice and apologies if I was rambling! \n\nMy other stats are:\n\nNeuroscience major, data science minor \n3.63 cGPA, 3.50 sGPA, upward-ish trend (3.86 pre college, 3.4, 3.62, 4.0, 3.75)\n\nweakness in chemistry — most/all of my poor grades are in gen chem, Orgo, biochem, mostly As otherwise\n\nNY resident ORM, ties to MA (undergrad), NJ, GA-ish, Illinois-ish\n\nClinical:\n\n926 hours - MA in an outpatient oncology clinic\n\n265 hours - volunteering at a pediatrics primary care (basically MA work)\n\n40 hours - volunteer campus EMT (volunteered at 2 marathons as an EMT, TA for CPR classes on campus)\n\n\nResearch:\n\n920 hours as a research assistant at a pharma company, no pubs and internal presentations only\n\n50 hours doing business/outreach research with a physician-based healthcare org, presentation to company CEO\n\n\nShadowing:\n\n37 hours colorectal surgery\n\n14 hours cardiology\n\n15 hours orthopedics\n\nWill prob have some oncology shadowing later this summer \n\n\nVolunteering:\n\n80 hours teaching English classes to new immigrants and refugees\n\n140 hours hosting and running Model UN conferences for underserved middle and high schoolers\n\n132 hours volunteering with NMDP (and being in leadership within my chapter)\n\n\nOther:\n\n1200+ hours on my university’s debate team (4 international awards, very involved in leadership with several positions)\n\n120 hours Performing (dance) in my university’s culture shows\n\n20ish hours on leadership in my dorm (not sure if I should include this, probably won’t)\n\nFluent in 4 languages including Spanish\n\n",

You mean I have to find a perfect vignette from every job and volunteer position that is humble, enlightening, paints me in a good light, isn't repetitive, is honest, is within like 600 characters, and then I have to rewrite it again for the other application service with requirements just different enough to be problematic??? \n\nThen there's no feedback. Unlike grades or the MCAT I'll never know if my writing was what got me accepted, or if it's the reason I never hear back. I'm just shouting disguised self-promotional advertisements into the void and spinning a slot machine.\n\nConvince me that the writing doesn't matter as much as submitting on time please 🙏",

Anyways, really just writing this post to hear how much an MPH has benefited you if you’ve gotten before med school or even after and you’re in this group. Or maybe how you thought it would benefit you a lot and maybe it wasn’t how you expected. Please let me know, I’m very interested in hearing these experiences! ",

      "title": "Parents not letting me stay at school over summer and I don’t know what to do",
      "content": "So basically I was planning to stay at my new apartment at my uni this summer, as I need to find research, study for the MCAT, and find clinical work without any distractions. \n\nHowever, today my dad dropped the bomb that whatever I do has to be at home. For context, my parents are strict, Asian parents. They’re also physicians, but they did their med school back in Asia. Anyways, this bomb threw a major wrench in my plans and I’m trying not to freak the fuck out. He told me that I can just apply for work and research when I go back to school in August. I told him that I NEED the summer to rack up hours as I’m going into my senior year and will have less time once the academic year starts. The reason I haven’t done these things yet is because I haven’t had time due to other extracurricular commitments, so it’s going to be tough to wait until the next academic year when I’m gonna be busy with classes again.\n\nMy parents keep telling me that they can get me a position working as a “volunteer” in the Emergency Department or as an Er Tech, which would be beneficial to me (and unfortunately nepotism), but it seems questionable because the hospitals that they work at aren’t even hiring for those positions right now, and I doubt that any volunteer position would allow actual hands-on patient care or responsibilities. However, my mom keeps telling me that I just need rec letters and I need to look good on paper and I can just lie about patient interactions. Whatever happened to going into medicine because I’m passionate about it? Am I fucking stupid for wanting a clinical job where I can grow as a human being instead of just checking another damn box off the pre-med checklist? They always tell me that they don’t want me to go into medicine, but then try to dictate what I do as pre-med. For example, when my dad heard that his friend’s son taking an extra quarter to graduate, he told me that I should take extra time and chill, no stress, no rush. So I thought hey, why don’t I take two gap years so I can have a year to really strengthen my application, and I told them this. Hence, I pushed back applying to research and work. Then, my mom randomly says “yeah so we don’t want you to take a second gap year.” So now I’m rushing and trying to apply for things because now my deadline is coming a lot sooner and I only have my senior year left, and on top of that, I don’t even have this summer because they’re forcing me to stay home.\n\nMy lease is already set to start as soon as school ends, and we’ll be paying rent anyway so it’s a waste of money for me not to stay there tbh.\n\nI keep trying to tell my parents that if I apply for work in our hometown, it’ll make things easy only over summer, but when I go back to school, I’m going to have to commute all the way back home just for a shift?? They keep telling me to just work in our town for the summer, but who the hell hires someone just for two months? I’d have to reapply again and that would be a whole nother headache, but of course I’m too stupid and young to have any say in what is good for me.\n\nI’ve even been applying for labs, but my dad said I can just drive to school for research and drive back home (1 hr+ commute each way). Why the fuck would I do that if I already have any apartment there? Between regularly commuting,  working, and studying for the MCAT, I know I’m going to get really fucking stressed. Ironically, my parents love to stress me the fuck out and then tell me not to get stressed.\n\nAs a side note, staying over the summer is very common here…like every other pre-med I know does that, and they’re either upstate or out of state. I live a lot closer than that, and they still don’t want me staying at uni even though I could rlly, rlly use this summer to strengthen my app. It’s not like I’m asking to go on a trip with my friends or to a concert. I’m asking to do something that would be beneficial to my future, and they’re so adamant about things being their way that they won’t even hear me out. It’s making me want to fucking kms on top of the other things I have going on in life. I’ve always been very responsible, and I always obey my parents. But this is just driving me up a fucking wall. Everything is always their way or the highway, and even though I’ve found some independence since I’m able to drive myself as I have a car, I still feel very much policed even though I always try so damn hard to execute everything that they ask of me to the best of my ability. \n\nAnyways I wanted to rant bc I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep tonight from this stress bomb. Ty and gn 😔😢\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

I was talking with my dad about getting a job this summer and he suggested getting certified as a phlebotomist because he thinks it’ll be good for my med school application and wanted to know if anyone here could provide some insight on wether or not I should do that. (I already have an internship at my local hospital so idk if this is just overboard and I should allocate some time elsewhere) ",

I’m currently in summer courses right now (7 credit hours) and working a part-time job.\n\nI haven’t done any research, clinical hours, or shadowing yet, but I definitely want to start all three. I’d like to find something flexible enough to work around school so I can start building that experience and hopefully use it for med school apps.\n\nFor those of you who’ve been through this stage — what should I be focusing on the most from now through the fall semester? I just don’t want to waste time on the wrong things. Appreciate any advice!",

This depression ended up being directly linked with undiagnosed ADHD, which is now being handled. Since then I have had a drive and passion for learning that I have never experienced before.\n\nThe other thing is my university is exclusively STEM, so the closest thing I could get to premed is chemical engineering, which would potentially add an additional 2-3 years, which I don’t think I could justify. \n",

I'm Canadian and applying to US med schools for the first time and I had a question about writing personal statements\n\nFor Canadian schools, they generally want clear-cut answers (with personal examples) to prompts rather then presenting a narrative or being very descriptive/ creative. \n\nHowever, from examples I find online, it seems like US schools are looking for applicants to write a narrative for their personal statements that presents experiences in a very personal way (example from Shemmassian: \"I *could feel the sweat rolling down my back as twenty first graders stared at me. It was July in Chicago, and the building where I volunteered as an English teacher twice a week did not have air conditioning. I had volunteered as a one-on-one tutor for the past six years, but this was my first time teaching a large group. The students, largely from working-class, Spanish-speaking households, reminded me of myself, as I grew up as the daughter of two Mexican emigrants*\")\n\nIs this the type of writing they are looking for? I understand adcoms receive many applications and sometimes they just skim through so it just seems like a very round-about way of telling why I want to be a doctor but if this is what they are expecting then I can frame my experiences in this way.

I know it’s not a pre-req technically but i would probably like to take anatomy to bolster my application (i did take physiology), and i would need to take bio 2. I got AP credit for calculus and physics 1 (and some other irrelevant stuff). I don’t think i have a lot of math hours if they don’t count AP credit as “hours”, since my only other math course was biostatistics (4 credits). Don’t know how important that is. Physics 1 i got AP credit for, but got an A in a 5 credit physics 2 course and was an undergrad TA for physics 1+2. \n\nMy main worry is the age on these courses. If i start now, the earliest I’ll be applying is next cycle so the earliest I’d be matriculating would be 2027 if my math is right. This puts some of these pre reqs such as chem 1 and bio 1 at 8 years old since they were done in 2019. \n\nSo follow up question here- am i good on those courses since i have more complex courses (e.g., chem 1 in 2019, but ochem in 2020 and toxicology 2022 so i show i kept the knowledge)?\n\nAnother thing im keeping in mind is cost- i paid off my undergrad loans and don’t want to put myself in more debt. But also, i will be located close to several communities colleges and universities with good premed post bacc programs, so any logistics other than cost won’t be an issue.\n\nTLDR: will CC for remaining courses after ungrad be okay? Is it worth retaking courses i got AP credit for at a community college? Do courses “expire”?\n\nThanks in advance!!\n",

It wasnt bench work it was more finding a gap in public health (SA) and making connections between areas of research and where more education needs to be. The reason I ask if this counts is because this research translated to trainings being implemented into specific programs Ive been apart of (i created the framework of the trainings from the research). There was no pub or poster, but i kept a rough track of hours (approx 150) and this is my only research thus far so curious if it would count?",

I am wondering for those who are applying or those who have been accepted, what is your non science degree. \n\nFor context: I am a 4.0 student (I got Deans list every semester and graduated with the highest recognition) I wasn’t involved much in school besides a year and a half in a club. So I’d have to take maybe 1-2 years to build myself as a competitive applicant. This means taking the premed requirements and doing volunteer hours and shadowing. I always wanted to be a doctor growing up but I fell into a deep depression during covid and post covid, I had no friends and no support system. But now I think I will be successful. \n\nI would really appreciate some insight. Thank you. ",

I heard community college credit isn’t favorable, so should I return back to my 4 year university part time? \n- When are the general deadlines for post bacc programs? Seems like they’re all varying..\n- Are SMPs for people who want to improve their GPA after already having all the pre reqs?\n\nI don’t mean to be redundant and I’ve been doing a lot of research where I can but I’m getting confused.

I am wondering for those who are applying or those who have been accepted, what is your non science degree.\n\nFor context: I am a 4.0 student (I got Deans list every semester and graduated with the highest recognition) I wasn’t involved much in school besides a year and a half in a club. So I’d have to take maybe 1-2 years to build myself as a competitive applicant. This means taking the premed requirements and doing volunteer hours and shadowing. I always wanted to be a doctor growing up but I fell into a deep depression during covid and post covid, I had no friends and no support system. But now I think I will be successful.\n\nI would really appreciate some insight. Thank you.",

      "content": "Hello everyone, I had a question. I’m currently going into my junior year of undergrad for pre med and I’m very lucky and have an amazing hospital based research internship.  \n\nThis internship wasn’t arranged via my college, I had to set it up and find it myself but I am getting college credits for my research internship because the Hospital required me to come in as a student for insurance purposes. \n\nTo receive 6 credit hours of research I barely minimum will be completing 256 research hours. This internship is both a blend of remote research where I’m combing through papers and data and compiling for various reasons and working in person with subjects where I am collecting data from biomechanic machines, strapping them in/setting them up, giving instructions. \n\nMy question is- I know that this internship will for sure count towards research hours but what I’m wondering is could it also count towards in person patient care hours? A quick google said yes but I wanted to get more opinions. \n\nExtra context: in addition to my internship I’m taking to summer classes online. I do not have time to get certified as a CNA because even if I were to take the accelerated 4 week course that would put me in July and at the end of summer I’m going to be observing quite a few surgeries. Additionally I just wouldn’t be able to balance CNA course work with everything I have going on right now. \n\nThere are currently no scribe positions available where I’m located. I have 42 hours of Patient Care Hours as a pediatric companion volunteer but I’m pretty sure I need way more hours. If my research internship hours aren’t able to count I can volunteer at my hospitals organization where I live either as a hospice volunteer or other position. I would do the patient care hours volunteering on the back burner of my classes and internship (on my off days) \n\nAnd then maybe I could do some scribing or 4-5 hours of volunteering when I’m in college on the weekends this coming year if need be. I’m just really stressed because my mom was mentioning that I should get certified as a CNA this coming school year and work while taking classes but I don’t think this is a good idea because I’m taking a bunch of hard classes this year both Fall and Spring semester— anatomy, physiology’s, microbiology, principles of biochem and physics. And all this content will be on mcat so I want to lock in and learn as much as I can. \n\nThen I’m stressed because I want to have all my stuff ready to go before the end of next summer (I’m taking my MCAT then) but I don’t want to have to cram a bunch of patient care hours in because I’ll be studying for the MCAT then, like I can get some in but I want to make sure the mcat studying is my priority.\n\nAny thoughts? Advice? Feedback?\n\nTLDR: I have a research internship that I’m receiving college credits for, I will count them as research hours. But I also work hands on with subjects, testing them, giving instructions, setting up equipment etc. can this internship count towards patient care hours aswell? \n",

Also, please be nice to me - I am not a superstar premed like a lot of the people on here.\n\nI took my first MCAT on 05/03 and got a 494. I am devastated, but know I can't do anything about it now. I decided to change up my study approach and I scheduled my retake for 08/23. My undergraduate GPA is 3.35 (including my school's grade forgiveness policy), so I would like a strong MCAT to make myself a better applicant (also for reference, I graduated in December 2024). I have strong LORs and a good PS; I have the entirety of my primaries for AMCAS and AACOMAS ready to submit.\n\nMy question is - what do I do here? Do I wait to apply until next cycle? Do I send it with the throwaway method for AMCAS, and wait to add more schools until I know my MCAT is good in late September? Do I apply broadly now and complete secondaries as they come in, and will schools put my application on hold until I get my new score back? There are several avenues I can take but I just don't know which one to go with. I am grateful to have parents who are very supportive (emotionally and financially), and they are pushing me to apply this cycle because \"the worst that happens is I don't get in, and I would be reapplying anyways next year\". Again, any advice is appreciated.",

Training new EMTs/students (200 hours)\n3. Shadowing (100 hours, mostly FM, but also ortho and rads)\n4. Food bank (80 hours)\n5. 7 Cups (200 hours)\n6. Employee at retail store (1k hours)\n7. Farmers market employee (3k hours)\n8. Awards (deans list 4x, presidents list 1x, magna cum laude)\n\n9/10. Probably going to add a couple of hobbies, like fishing, golf, or skiing\n\nIs this enough activities? I don't think I'll be able to stretch it to 15 total. Also is it okay to separate my EMT work from the training? I feel like the training was pretty significant and I don't want to just mention it in passing in my EMT description. I also don't have other leadership so I wanna have at least something there. For the shadowing, I'm not sure if that should also be multiple entries. They were definitely very different experiences, FM was all clinic stuff, ortho I saw consults and then scrubbed into a bunch of surgeries, and then rads was just looking at CT scans and stuff. But being shadowing I'm not sure if it's different enough to list separately.",

I’ve had people describe what they do (like a CV/resume) and I’ve had people be reflective on their experiences. \n\nI’ve spoken to several schools and it’s come up that being more reflective in my activities list could be beneficial, whether it be for my MME’s or not.  \n\nObviously 700 characters is not a lot, so I am figuring out how to best go about this. Any insight would be great!",

      "content": "So I took college physics last fall and I did not take the lab for it. My college is small so they were offering it online with another university through acadeum. For my college, i don't need to lab to satisfy my requirements to graduate but I didn't realize that I would need the lab for medical school. It's my fault that I didn't do enough research to know that I needed the lab while I took the class.But anyway I have been going back and forth with registrars office because I can do the lab online if my school places it on their acadeum list. My schools acadeum list had General physics I lab and I made it clear that General physics and college physics were not the same and I went through the process of going to my advisor and telling him that I needed registrars to find a class for me (this is what we were told to do if a class we want isn't there). so anyway they tell me they're looking for w class and never get back to me until i send a follow\nup email this week and they sent me an invite to a general physics I lab. I'm completely over it and pissed so I want to know if it will be okay if I take a general physics I lab if I only took college physics??",

      "content": "First, thank you in advance for any help!\n\nWaiting for my mcat score, but hoping to be in 508-511 range based on previous FL (so let’s pretend that is what i got)\n\nI have a 3.59 cpa; 3.16 sgpa with A/A- across board until i flopped the last year with several Bs and then 5 C/C+s… (2020-2021)\n\nMy last year, i had nearly given up on the med school route, worrying about costs, other options to pursue that were within the realm of medicine, sciences, and philanthropy, family (i am first to go to college and thus graduate from college), and lots of deaths in my circle. Was working over full-time between several jobs (childcare and 2 clinical settings) and saved studying for last minute - a complete mess up for classes that shouldve been easy (such as physics with calc, considering i basically took it already in high school and usually so very well in that realm) \n\nORM (f, white) but first gen college, single mother not in poverty below the line for URM, but in other ways, i believe it may apply; supported myself since 17/18 except for some college tuition funds my father had before he remarried and dissolved the idea of helping (for which i am tremendously grateful; very fortunate compared with others) \n\nNon-trad, several years out of school, have gained over the past 7 years:\n\n~700 hrs volunteering (on record, doesnt include misc not included as bulk of my app) - animals, homeless\n\n~4000 hours in OR\n\n~2000 hrs with other aspects of my job (covering my entire state/healthcare systems) \n\n~700 hrs scribing and shadowing \n\n~2000+ hrs in sports (including collegiate for one year)\n\n~600 hrs in another hospital role\n\n~1000 hrs childcare/babysitting (including newborns and non-verbal autistic children), not sure if helps, but for a physician and a professor \n\n~150 hrs research (more like 250ish, but not included) - i really want to do research and am very close with my school’s staff still, so i plan on finding a way to do this, but my job is essentially on call 24/7 and was too focused on paying the bills at the time\n\n~350 hrs working in research center/with dogs at a well-known institution (so technically research but in a dif way without giving out too much info)\n\n~4000 hrs working in another non-clinical but person-facing role throughout high school into college\n\n-emt cert/shadowed back in day (personally love pre-clinical setting and would go paramedic if had time to do everything) and volunteering beginning next week \n\n-ivy league transfer for a sports scholarship that saved me $ (might look bad, might look good; couldnt beat finances at that time of my life)\n\nNow i reveal my identity, lol: \n\nFL resident since college; well-established here but roots in PA and NJ, so hoping ties and family in those states could help\n\nOh and question: do they take in to consideration your permanent residence/address for ORM/UrM? I rent from my friend but in a multi-million dollar house - renting a room here is cheaper than an apartment in my area, so hope the stats don’t confuse me for having that sort of money lol \n\nI do believe my essays speak from the heart and clearly convey my interests. I believe my letters of recommendation are solid (my professors from seven years ago still thankfully remember me and have one from supervisor, physician, PI for lab) and from what im told, personality-wise/for interviews, i get good feedback \n\nNonetheless, any luck on applying MD, especially in FL (FSU, FIU, UM) or northeast tri state area (ny, nj, pa)? \n\nI am planning on taking a few classes this fall semester to show i can handle it but not sure that would be too late for this cycle or if it could help at all (also using as a back up if need to apply next year)\n\nI do feel okay going DO, especially if it means i can be back home to take care of my grandmother, but MD *more easily* matches more of my pursuits (not for specialty, but research and business endeavors/public health initiatives and teaching).

As part of this cycle I've had to retake my MCAT because my old one expired (joy!), ended up with a major improvement on my score (516->522).\n\nI guess my question is whether this school that I'm waitlisted to will be able to see this score? Do I need to do anything to release it to them? I can see it in my 2025 application and obviously attached the test date to my 2026 one when I created the application.\n\nThis school does accept updates, but unfortunately I already sent an update letter in the fall (a month or two after I interviewed) and recently sent a letter of intent. I don't really want to bug them but just wanted to make sure that they see the score. \n\nGrateful for any advice/thoughts!",

      "content": "For context I’m into my second gap year and haven’t applied yet.\n\nI’m sorry the story is so long, tldr summary: question in title, and is it a bad idea to change cities causing me to quit a current job that’s going fine although kind of unremarkable, after a few months of starting.\n\nEnd of junior year I found out about a nice clinical volunteering club but mainly got to participate in senior year, over the span of about 8 months start-end. These were my first ever clinical hours, I unfortunately started so late\n\nAfter graduation last year I had to stop volunteering there as I moved out of the college city. \n\nBut I really didn’t plan to return to my hometown. Without going into detail, when I had first arrived at college it was like a burden was lifted off my shoulders because I was no longer part of a smaller cultural community that I had grown up in which had literally so much drama. I wanted to still be in touch with some cultural activities which were a huge part of my identity, without feeling like I was back to square one by returning to form commitments with the same few people if that makes sense.\n\nI don’t think I felt as strongly before, but these were reflections on coming outside of it. Also life was easier in some ways living away from family.\n\nYet for multiple reasons it didn’t make sense to stay in my college area wither after graduation. I had planned to move to either of 2 cities I had visited many times that had a lot of diversity, potential to explore my hobbies, and were much closer to my hometown without being right there.\n\nI felt I needed to get a clinical job ASAP and applied to jobs in both these places and my hometown as a back up. I had no certs, and as it turned out, the two cities I wanted I didn’t hear back from employers in, but I got something in my hometown. I felt like I couldn’t afford to wait as I’d hardly accumulated hours in college compared to just about everyone I knew.\n\nSo I took the scribe job in my hometown. It took more almost 2 months from hiring to finally start going in-person. But after 2 wks I got taken out because I couldn’t keep up with their pace as a complete newbie. The company placed me at another location and I waited 2 whole months to start there, but soon after starting the doctor there replaced me as well.\n\nIn all I would say about 4 months were used for a job where I got a small number of clinical hours.\n\nThen, after another 2 months where I wasn’t sure what to do anymore, I landed a somewhat unique role in healthcare that was more of a desk job with a bit of direct patient interaction. However after ~5 months I was let go along with many others. I got a rec letter from them so it’s okay, it’ll hopefully be clear on the app it wasn’t due to any sort of conflict.\n\nDespite both not lasting long, these jobs were meant to be 1 year+ commitments, so I never even considered trying to move out of my hometown again. In the past year I never got involved with my hobbies again because like I said I don’t really want to go back into those circles. \n\nI really regret coming back here because now, on top of the voluntary restrictions making my life kind of depressing, when I look on my app it looks like I have no real personality so it’s basically a lose-lose situation.\n\nIn march, I got a new scribe job again because I desperately wanted to get enough clinical hours through employment to apply this cycle. But at this point for a number of reasons I am now postponing applying to next year.\n\nThis scribe job is WAY more reasonable in its expectations than the company I’d joined last year. I don’t find it that inspiring, but I know they won’t randomly terminate my position. They don’t require us to stay for any minimum duration, like my last 2 companies did, but ironically I can finally expect to stay here 1 year+ because things are so stable.\n\nAt the same time, my current apartment lease will be ending in a few months. This means I can consider moving out again. Obviously things aren’t perfect anywhere but I do regret coming here because it’s been a year and I still can’t convince myself to just rejoin my previous activities and social events. Plus whoever I know moved out except two friends but we don’t meet in person, just talk on the phone anyway. Most others who left, like me, had no interest in returning but they actually followed through and settled elsewhere.\n\nIf I move out now, I definitely will not have kept any job for a full year by the time applications open next cycle, and it might seem like something is wrong with me. \n\nAnd I’ve tried applying for jobs out of town but felt like interviewers don’t take me seriously when I say I’ll move since I haven’t arranged for housing there yet. My options are already limited since I still didn’t get any MA/EMT certification. So if I move I’ll apply only after that and it may take another 2 months to actually start.\n\nBut if I renew my lease I’ll probably end up wondering how much better things could have been if I got out to start things fresh. With commute distance, lack of personal involvement as a scribe, low pay, etc my only motivation to stay at my job is having a long term commitment to show.",

      "content": "Hi y'all. I'm a junior Pre-Med student and I want to get my ducks in line for Med School. I'm from jersey, and I originally planned on attending Rowan-VIRTUA School of Osteopathic Medicine, but after speaking with my father (a finance guy) about it, I'm not entirely sure what to do anymore. It's always been a dream of mine to become a D.O.. From what I've heard the coursework is more holistic and puts an emphasis on the whole body rather than directly treating symptoms independently. I try to see DO's whenever I can. For me, there's a big difference in treatment.\n\nHowever, the issue is that I'm 2 hours from Rowan Virtua at home, which means I would have to rent an apartment while I did my studies there, and have a life away from my family (with whom I'm very close, Puerto Rican families tend to be inseparable lol). There's also PCOM, which is a much older DO program that's about half the drive to Rowan (but out of state), but I've heard mixed reviews about administration and academics there in recent years here on Reddit (though if anyone has any advice about that school I'd love to hear it, too).\n\nThe (main) other option I have is Rutgers Medical School in Newark, NJ. They're a pretty reputable school (at least for undergrad) and it would be a reasonable commute there and back. In other words, I would be able to attend Med School while living at home, avoiding the cost of rent entirely. When you're paying your own way through Medical School, you want to avoid unnecessary expenses. I understand that.\n\nAt the same time, however, I can't help but feel torn between RU, Rowan Virtua, and PCOM. At RU, the best option overall, I would only be able to get my MD. It's alright, but I'd prefer to be a DO. I guess that's what I want to ask -- from the experiences of those of you here, are there major differences between DO and MD programs? Would I be able to practice medicine more holistically the way a DO would if I had my MD? Or does the coursework make a huge difference? If not, then how?\n\nAny advice any of you might have would be greatly appreciated! Thank you so much (and sorry for the long post lol)!\n\n",

I consider this part of my most meaningful experiences since I've learned a lot from pathologists, shaping a lot of my career interests.   \n  \nThe other 75% of the time I am a lab manager in a basic science lab, working with a completely different set of people and doing experiments. Obviously I have different responsibilities relating to being the manager and part of the research team.

I’ve spent some time at my job shadowing anesthesia providers but I have no idea if that would even count towards clinical hours and if it does I don’t have more than like 250-350. \n\nI don’t have enough money to quit my job and return to school for bio, and my local university/community college have zero options that wouldn’t conflict with my work schedule.

I’ve been planning to attend since then.\n\nHowever, just about a week ago, I was accepted off the waitlist at SLU SOM (Saint Louis University School of Medicine – MD program), which is where I’d ideally like to go. I submitted a “Plan to Enroll” to SLU today through AMCAS.\n\n\n\nHere are my main concerns:\n\nDo AMCAS and AACOMAS communicate with each other? Could I be penalized in any way for holding two active decisions across different application services?\n\nShould I officially commit to SLU first before withdrawing from CCOM? I’m hesitant to give up my secured spot at CCOM without knowing for sure that my place at SLU is locked in.\n\nIs there any risk of losing both spots during this transition? That’s honestly my biggest fear right now.\n\nIf anyone has experience navigating this kind of switch—especially between DO and MD programs—I would be incredibly grateful for your thoughts or advice.",

So I took two classes at UNE online during the summer of 2022-2023 while I was still enrolled in my primary undergraduate institution. They gave me a major as \"post bacc cont education pre-health\" when I wasn't enrolled in a \"post-bacc\" program (likewise hadn't even graduated at the time). Was wondering if people that took one or two classes over the summer just designated these classes as undergrad or post-bacc. Legit have no idea how to classify since I took them in undergrad if that makes sense. I don’t know if AMCAS will consider these post-bacc if I didn’t take them “post-bacc” if that makes sense. \n\nThanks!!",

I do think i can improve that score because I had taken it in the midst of a difficult time of my life, so i think with more time and better circumstances I can do better, but of course thats no guarantee and I still cant financially afford to put work on hold so i can devote to this test.\n\nThe alternative is just applying now with what i have, only to DO schools because I would'nt be competitive enough for MD without a better mcat. The benefit of that is i can start in fall 2026 instead of waiting a whole additional year to start fall 2027, with just a chance at MD. The downside is I just am unsure if future me will be happy i saved the year, or will i wish i was patient in order to have more speciality options.\n\nReally unsure what to do.",

Truthfully, my activities aren't too special/unique (hospital volunteer, PCA, tutor, bartending, boxing club, cancer fundraiser, etc), so I'm wondering if making them personal using experiences rather than the resume format would work better, as I'm sure every doctor knows what a PCA does. I'm just worried I am overdoing it, because while my experiences aren't dramatic or too \"flowery\", I don't want an adcom to get bored of reading my application or for them to appear too dramatic.

I am taking physiology (bio course) this year, but by the time I apply, I won’t have the lab yet (it’s only a summer class). \n\nWould it still be worth taking bio 1, if I can’t take the lab?

What would be a good time to retake it if I want to apply during this cycle? Should I send my application with my current score and a prospective test date listed or wait? Should I even apply during this cycle at all?\n\nMy GPA isn't that good (3.39 cumulative, 3.15 BCPM), but I think have a good upward trend (cum: 3.36 --> 3.39, BCPM: 3.036 --> 3.185). I think I've hit every AAMC core competency through my activities (medical assistant, volunteering, leadership, personal hobbies, etc.) so that's definitely the strongest part of my application.\n\nWould really appreciate some advice, I'm completely lost on what to do. Have any of you gotten into med schools with similar stats to mine? ",

Not to provide any excuses, but I did poorly compared to how I was feeling for FLs.\n\nFor reference, I was scoring 131 on p/s which used to boost my score, and for now, I am pretty confident I have 13-14 mistakes. For B/B, I used to get 130s but now, I have at least 12 confirmed mistakes and 5 uncertain. Those were life-savers for my score, but I highly messed up. Do I retake on July or move on?

It is june 3rd of the 2025 med school application cycle. I interviewed for MSUCOM and was waitlisted in late january, this is my top choice DO program and I would attend this cycle if I got off the waitlist. Yesterday, I got an acceptance from LECOM for which I just paid the matriculant deposit. I have heard a lot of controversy coming from this school recently. Additionally there are unnecessary rules (wearing suits to lectures, no water bottles or anything to drink). I took the MCAT last year in June which was a 507. I retook the mcat and my score will come back june 27th, a score which i think is much better than last time (realistically 512-517). My GPA is like 3.8, sGPA 3.6 (upward trend). Knowing all of this, what should I do? What are realistically my options, and chances under each?\n\n  \nSome extra info: I think I am a pretty strong applicant, I only ended up applying to a couple in state MDs, but mostly DOs, and like finished my secondary for MSU in December.\n\nTBH, wanted to take a gap but ended up applying (kinda rushed under parental pressure). I finally feel ready to go to med school now, but was NOT ready as a person when I was applying last year. I would happily go to MSUCOM given getting off the waitlist, but what if not? Any advice would be helpful! thanks",

I also plan to take two upper-division science courses during the application cycle next semester to strengthen my academics.\n\n**ECs:**\n\n* **Volunteer:** Church (250 hrs), Holding NICU babies at Children’s Hospital (40 hrs)\n* **Tutoring:** Genetics/Molecular Biology tutor at my university (350 hrs, volunteer) I chose to dedicate a lot of time here because I have two W in genetics but aced it my third time.\n* **Research:** Summer research program with a poster presentation/ Neuroscience research (at university)\n* **Clinical:** Anesthesia Technician (2000+ hrs), Phlebotomist (700 hrs)\n* **URM:** Bilingual\n* **Gap Year Plans:**\n   * Become a Genetics TA\n   * Volunteer at an animal shelter or with a suicide text crisis line (looking for meaningful ways to use my time)\n   * Volunteer as a researcher in immunology at my university\n* **Major:** Neuroscience\n\n  \n**Note:** I’m meeting with my advisor soon but wanted to get as many opinions and as much feedback as possible.\n\nAny feedback or comments would be greatly appreciated! 😊\n\nDo you guys think I have a shot at MD schools? Or is my GPA killing my application? Should I consider a post-bac?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/fjz1uvpj9r4f1.png?width=3550&format=png&auto=webp&s=af97ed82c53f1cf52c1273e92093eefd76c5ac72\n\n",

I spend my spring semester volunteering at a rehabilitation center for cancer patients and that’s it. It was just so hard to manage anything else with my classes. For next year I’m planning to continue with this, volunteer at the hospital, and get into a research lab. I wanted to apply straight through and not take a gap year. I plan to take an emt course this year and start emt next summer. I haven’t taken the course yet bcuz I don’t have my drivers license. And I’m going to look into medical assistant as well. I guess I’m kind of looking for motivation as I feel so behind and stressed out bcuz I didn’t do good enough on my classes this year after studying so much. Might be a little dramatic but is there still hope for me? ",

      "content": "Hey everyone! I was planning on applying this application cycle but my MCAT retake score completely changed my plans. I am an URM FL resident with a 3.9 GPA. My first MCAT was a 502 and my retake was 505. I felt more confident this second time around and was scoring better (range of FLs: 508-512), but I ended up underperforming. I recently graduated, so if I postponed, I would take a second gap year. I feel strongly about pursuing MD programs, although I am open to consider DO programs in my future as I navigate these next decisions in my life. I will also likely retake the MCAT for my third time to improve my competitiveness. Some of my experiences as an applicant:\n\n\\- 350 clinical volunteering hours\n\n\\- 550 non-clinical volunteering hours\n\n\\- 700 hours of research with the hope to get publications this upcoming year\n\n\\- Strong leadership experiences as my undergraduate institution, including an orientation-related one with 1,000 hours over two years\n\n\\- 350 hours in a job I had in undergrad\n\nWhat next steps should I consider? I open to all and any advice and truly appreciate all of this community's help!",

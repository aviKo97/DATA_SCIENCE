      "title": "My husband finalized his paternity leave paperwork and was laid off the next day effective immediately, no severance. Any recourse?",
      "content": "Location: Georgia. \n\nMy husband and I are expecting our first child in a couple weeks. His company has known about this, he just finalized his paternity leave (2 weeks paid) paperwork with his boss yesterday. Today that same boss called him into a zoom meeting with HR where he was laid off effective immediately. THANKFULLY I am on my own health insurance, he was told his would end the same day he was laid off. He was told several positions were being eliminated to cut costs, but no one else on his team was let go. No indication as to what those other positions were. \n\nThey want him to sign a liability waiver in order to receive 3 weeks of SUB payments to supplement his unemployment (which is capped at $350ish a week where we live). The SUB payments are for 1 week per year of employment, so he'd qualify for 3 weeks. That's the only type of severance offered.\n\nMy assumption is there's not much we can do to argue the retribution/paternity side of things, but would it be worth seeking an attorney to negotiate more severance? Or do you think we should just take the deal, sign the waiver and focus on baby?\n\nThanks so much. ",

      "content": "Location: Michigan \n\na few weeks ago my daughter (15) was taken into custody. A majority of what happened was caught on the cameras in the main section of the house. I nor her father were home at the time. \n\nI was at work, as well as my husband and my daughter (15), my other daughter (18) and her boyfriend (22) were the only ones home. My two daughters do not get along and the boyfriend just adds to it. \n\nIn the video you can see him choking my younger daughter, she goes to her room, where he takes a chair and puts it under her door to lock her in there. She does break the door frame by pulling the door and hitting it and he comes running over there and she throws a Bluetooth speaker at her and hurts his wrist. They call his father (who is an officer two towns over) as well as the police. As they’re talking to my younger daughter the boyfriend is shouting and calling her names and the grabs a roll of trashbags that were on the counter and throws them at him. \n\nThe police come, she’s taken into custody over night, this happens around 3pm, and when I get home that’s when my older daughter tells me what happened. I call, and the only thing they tell me is I can see her in the morning and charges are being filed, but I’m not told what they are. \n\nI show up at the courthouse the moment they open, they won’t let me see or talk to her. I finally get to see her when she enters the court room. They never have her a lawyer to talk to, never got to talk to me or her father, and had to sign and agree to his witness statement. \n\nShe’s been charged with two counts of assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon, and destruction of property. \n\nI asked what the weapon was and it was THE TRASH BAGS, and since it’s my house that I own, wouldn’t I have to press charges for the door frame being broken? \n\nMy older daughters boyfriend told the police she was “suicidal” when she has never had any mental health issues, so right from the courthouse she was taken to a juvenile home, until someone can come out and search the house and make sure it’s safe, and was placed on 6 months probation. \n\nI brought up that it was all recorded and they said they already know what had happened. I read over his statement and it was NOTHING that was shown on the cameras, that also have audio. \n\nI have already informed my daughter that he is no longer to come around the house, if she wants to go anywhere she can meet him at the road. \n\nI’m just wondering what my options are, cause they’re ignoring everything I’ve said or tried to do, and I feel like half of what was done wasn’t even legal. \n",

      "content": "For context, I’m a 24 year old female in LOCATION: New York State. \n\nI am pregnant (3 months in a week) and my bladder has been a nightmare. I was driving through New York State (I’m from and live in NJ) and my bladder was about to burst and I pulled into a liquor store parking lot (was the nearest to me) I ran in, bought something so I could be a customer (a Gatorade), asked if there was a bathroom, he said no. I said okay, thanks and ran back out. Tried to look for a cup or anything I could pee in. At this point it was either I peed on my seat or in the grass behind the door of my car. I started panicking and actually began to pee a bit, so i realized i needed to squat down and pee or else I’d get it all over myself. I was wearing a dress, so it’s not like you could see anything inappropriate (though the act itself is inappropriate in my opinion most definitely). \n\nIn less than three seconds, the guy was running out of the liquor store screaming he was gonna call the cops and it was disgusting, then read my license plate back to me. I felt horrible and I know it was wrong- I literally couldn’t do anything but apologize in between the screaming and go on. I assume he already has my license/where I live and whatnot because he had scanned it at the liquor store and I’d assume they keep it. \n\n\nI guess I could argue it in court, I just wish I’d have sucked it up and told him I was pregnant. I just didn’t want the judgement of being in a liquor store while I was pregnant if that makes sense. \n\nSo… what are the chances that anything comes of this? And how would I fight it in court? I just hate myself for doing it and I feel like a disgusting person for doing it. \n\nEdit: thank you so very much everyone for your input!! I pray nothing comes of it. It was in a little town in upstate NY- not NYC. \n\nTo answer a question I didn’t think I’d answer (I apologize I worded it wrong thank you for catching me!!! lol… was very flustered and reddit won’t let me answer people back- I’m so sorry I’m not trying to ignore yall!!) I didn’t see anything at first to buy that wasn’t alcohol, so I put whatever cheapest airplane bottle to the left of the register was so I could still be buying something to be a customer (since that’s a curtesy/rule in a lot of places for the bathroom). As he asked for my ID and I handed it over, I realized he had a fridge on the other end of the counter turned towards the back and I said “I’ll just get something from there actually” because I could have used the Gatorade lol (green Gatorade on a pregnancy is 10/10 btw)",

      "content": "A few nights ago, my (18F) friend (18F) and I went to a party in the city. I left my bag at her house while we were gone. While we were out, she had given her garage code to two guys she was friends with they could wait for her to come back at her house.\n\nHowever, those two brought a third man she didn’t invite, and when she saw him on her door camera, she panicked and drove us back home right away.\n\nWhen we got there, all three men were still in her room, which we discovered to be completely trashed — and I found my bag sprawled open and missing several items, including:\n\t\n•\tMy car keys (which I later found, but they had been disassembled)\n\t\n•\tMy debit card and $60 cash (still missing)\n\t\n•\tMy AirPods (still missing)\n\t\n•\tMy driver’s license (found broken in half)\n\nThey all denied responsibility and blamed each other. There’s camera footage of them entering the house, and I have their full names.\n\nThe next day, my bank contacted me about a $720 attempted charge to an insurance “company” the boys work for (i sent a screenshot of the notification to my friend, who informed me about their affiliation). That’s when I went to the police with my friend and filed a report, providing everyone’s names and contact info, and the list of stolen items.\n\nNow, one of them has messaged me on social media, threatening to sue me for “defamation of character” if I move forward with pressing charges and saying he will “ruin my and my parents’ lives.” I have saved all the messages.\n\t\n\nThis whole thing has left me feeling really anxious and scared. What should be my next steps? I really want whoever is responsible to face consequences but I don’t want to put myself in danger. Any advice is appreciated.\n\nLocation: Illinois",

I am in a very tough situation. My brother committed suicide last Saturday and when we were trying to figure out why, we found out that he had maxed out all my parents credit cards, hasn’t paid his student loans (my mom is a co-signer) , took all their savings and checkings and hasn’t been paying most of the bills. He was in charge of everything for my parents all their finances, just everything. They had no idea what was going on and any mail or emails that were notices for my parents he hid them. I don’t live with my parents but I am now moving back home after all this to help them with this mess. But idk much about navigating all these finances. My parents also just sold their other house they owned and were renting out bringing in $800,000. They have to put aside $300k for taxes ( if anyone knows how to lower that I would also appreciate it). We are estimating about 400k in debt. The wanted to finally retire next year with the money from the house because they are both over 65, but it seems like they can’t. I also don’t make much on about $50k a year after taxes and I have my own student loans to pay for. I still have to pay for my apartment until I can get someone to take it over. I just signed a lease for on April 15th. I had everything finally set up for me. It just feels like my world is tumbling down right when all my hard work was paying off. Location: New York \n\nAny advice or resources would be greatly appreciated. Thank you all!",

I had just turned 19 a few days prior and it was the night of his wedding, inside of his home on his living room couch. I was intoxicated/ asleep. \n\nDNA came back positive on my genital area but I'm just finding out now that my entire sexual assault kit hasn't been tested, and just the proof in one swab area isn't enough.

Then I was told the DA needed to do more investigating, then I'm finally put into contact with someone from the sexual assault unit 7 months later and I'm just getting incomplete answers. \n\nIs this normal for DNA to not be tested all at once?

      "title": "Neighbor caught on video keying my rental; police discourage charges—what are my legal options?",
      "content": "Location: Washington State.\n\nMy neighbor—let’s call him \"Peter\"—was caught on camera scratching a rental car I had parked on the street in front of my home. The rental was covered only by the credit-card collision waiver, which may no longer apply because I kept the car longer while I tried to sort this out.\n\nPeter has a history of doing the same thing. A year and a half ago he keyed my personal vehicle (no video then, so I covered expenses). At least four other neighbors have filed reports over the past three years. A neighbor suggested Peter may have dementia (according to Peter’s adult son, “John”).\n\n**Police Statements:** \nOfficer “Alex” phoned me a few days after I reported the incident. I gave a statement and later texted him the video and photos. He and another officer visited, asked whether I wanted to press charges, and I initially replied \"not right now\". I wanted to understand options and if Peter would cooperate (I don't know what pressing charges translated to). Several neighbors showed up and gave Alex their own prior case numbers. After speaking with Peter for about twenty minutes, the officers left without updating me.\n\nOne or two days later, Officer Alex asked for an entire day’s worth of camera footage and the rental company’s phone number. He also asked about who and how many other people were close by the vehicle etc. These felt like odd questions, but I chose to dismiss them since he was doing his job. The files were too large to send, so I explained that another neighbor’s footage corroborated the exact time with audio of a scraping sound.\nThrough a neighbor I texted \"John\", Peter’s son, and sent him the repair estimate. John promised a couple times to “follow up ” but nothing happened. It wasn't his responsibility, so I didn't follow up either. I finally returned the rental (I kept it longer than needed, while attempting to work something out with John) and completed the damage report; the company said they'd follow up but haven't  yet told me what, if anything, I owe.\n\n**Initiating Charges:**\nAn attorney advised me to press charges (brief legal insurance consult) and, if the police stalled, to contact the city prosecutor. When I asked Officer Alex to initiate charges, he replied weeks later, \"advising\" me not to file as the case is was likely to be dismissed: he said Peter was mentally unfit to defend himself, and repeatedly told me just to give the rental company the police report. I insisted. \nHe called back an hour later after needing to talk to a couple people. He alternated between advising the case would be thrown out, insisting I give the rental company the police report and advising that Peter's Son says he'll soon move his father under care. In our concluding exchange, I directly asked if he was refusing my request. I don't recall his reply - but he did not agree to initiate charges. I politely asked for his decision in writing. He took my email and agreed to provide one within the hour but never sent anything.\n\n**Recent Slight Twist:**\nHere's an interesting bit… when recently providing an update to a neighbor, he informed me that Peter's son \"John\", who I'd been communicating with, was actually a police officer himself. This context forced me to consider my interactions with Officer Alex in a different light.\n\nI am now waiting to hear from the rental company about what I may be liable for. I would appreciate advice on any legal or practical steps I can take next.\n\nIn an ideal outcome:  \n\n* I am not held liable for damage to the rental vehicle.\n* Appropriate action is taken so this never happens again. I don't have children, but my neighbors do and no one wants to see someone hurt over a neighbor getting aggressive.\n* I am compensated for expenses incurred while repairing my own vehicle a year ago (deductible, rental costs).\n* My neighbors are compensated for expenses incurred from repairing / loss of use of their vehicles over the last couple years.\n\nInsight to other general considerations/options would also be helpful.\nTo be clear, it's not my intent that this gentleman be arrested/detained.\n\n**TLDR**:\nCamera footage shows my neighbor Peter scratching my rental; Police officer discouraged me from pressing charges. I’ve since learned Peter’s son John (with whom I was communicating with) is also a police officer. I'm curious what options I have.",

      "content": "My mom got a call from her bank in Maine this evening asking if she had written a check dated 1995. She obviously said no and told them it was fraud. The bank said they would try to reverse the transaction, but also told her to report it to the police.\n\nWhen she tried to report it to the police in Maine (where her parents’ old house is located and where the checks were likely stolen from), they refused to take the report because she no longer lives there. She then went to the local police in Connecticut (where she lives now), and they said they couldn’t do anything since it's not in their jurisdiction.\n\nShe went back through her account thoroughly and discovered that multiple checks have already been cashed, all dating from various points in the 1990s. This amounts to several thousand dollars that has been stolen.\n\nThese checks are likely from her parents’ house which was broken into a few years ago and may have been broken into again more recently to steal these old checks. She sent a detailed email to the bank making it very clear that these checks are not valid and should not be honored under any circumstance.\n\nIt’s after hours now and all she can do is wait but we’re not sure what else she can do.\n\nWhat else should she do?\n\nLocation: Connecticut (Crime occurred in Maine)\n\nEdit:  \nUpdate!\n\nShe has been refunded the initial first large amount/check. They are working on the other charges. She has to fill out a lot of paperwork and mail it to them and may even need to go up there in-person. Apparently someone was supposed to call her about the situation and help resolve it yesterday but they were busy. From what the bank has told her these were old checks that were processed/cashed in the 90s and were then sent back to her or held in the bank vault. They were then stolen and photocopied and presented at an ATM. Now it's just the waiting game after she gets her paperwork notarized and mailed. Thanks so much everyone!",

      "content": "Location: Rockingham NC\nFor the last year and a half I have called and called animal control on a neighbor a few houses down from me. First it was all of their dogs getting out (3 to 4 pits, breed doesn't matter but still a pack of them is scary for any breed). I've called on them not feeding the dogs. Like I have a photo of one of them so skinny I could put my hand around it's midsection and could count every rib. \n\nMore recently I have called as I was walking my dog on leash and ended up having to grab the pit as it lunged to attack my border collie. Thankfully he didn't get to her but all the same I have another neighbor who was driving home and witnessed that event.. all I got was a sorry from one of the teenagers after I had been struggling with their dog trying to attack mine in the middle of the road. I called this in, mainly as I walk my dogs ans shouldn't have to worry about an aggressive dog that could and should be kept in it's own yard and fence. But also we have elderly people who walk dogs here and a lady with a dog and baby stroller. \n\nAgain tonight this same dog is loose. Not only that but he's in my neighbors yard (something he has done before) and standing ready to fight my dogs that are in my fence. I had let them out for the bathroom and heard a sudden commotion. He was ready to fight my newfoundland and German Shepard if that fence wasn't there. \n\nI'm calling animal control again but what else can I do? I haven't walked my dogs after that encounter last week. I'm 3 months pregnant so I shouldn't be fighting off a dog to be able to walk in peace. If the house was further away I'd just walk elsewhere but it's around the corner from me.. and these pits have been up in my front yard before too. ",

      "content": "Location: Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas (Cleburne/Johnson County specifically)\n\nMy parents were sent a packet with this lawsuit information. This is the first contact they've had. They weren't served for any of the previous court hearings, even when you pull it up online, it shows unserved. I absolutely believe my parents when they say that this is the first they're hearing about anything related to this.\n\nThey have no idea what the debt is for. No one at Jefferson Capital will return calls. We've been trying, both me and my mom/dad. We can't get anything at all out of them, just \"someone will call you back tomorrow/Monday\" and then nothing. Most of the time we just don't get anyone at all.\n\nI can't find any information, other than the amount they're being sued for, and that the first filing was in Decmber 2016. Obviously the debt would have to be for something pre-2016, potentially as far back as 2010. \n\nThe packet they were mailed is requesting a post judgement receiver, which I know is already bad. I don't know how it got this far without my parents being notified. I've searched their emails, the paperwork and medical records my mom saved from that time period thinking it might have been mistaken for something else, even the Informed Delivery stuff from the post office. I can't find anything from Jefferson Capital or the county courts, so I'm truly at a loss there.\n\nI know this company is shady. I had a run-in with them myself over a bill that was sent to collections in error. It was hell trying to get them to drop it, even with proof from the company the bill originated from. I've seen the posts about them on Reddit and the lawsuits against them for their business practices. I really don't want my parents trying to fight this/figure it out on their own, because they don't really understand their rights around debt collection/collectors.\n\nI know my parents are already pretty screwed. The amount of the debt is ~$2k, which it'd be easier for me to pay it for them so they don't get screwed over more. It'd probably also cost more to hire a lawyer at this point, plus we'd still be on the hook for the original debt. I don't know if there would even be a point in getting a lawyer in the first place, at this point. \n\nAm I overlooking any options? Is there any way I can help my parents find out the original creditor/amount or fight this?\n\nIf the best option is to offer to settle it, I'm willing to do that. Is the settlement amount a \"this is the only offer\" or is it something I may be able to negotiate a bit on? \n\nThank you for any help/advice offered.",

      "content": "Location: Texas\n\nI’m the parent of a 14-year-old with severe, nonverbal autism and we live in Georgia. Last year, during a crisis, I placed him in a residential treatment facility in Texas (Nexus Children’s Hospital). They promised intensive behavioral therapy, education, and 24/7 medical care.\n\nInstead, he was heavily medicated, confined to a hospital room, and did not receive the therapies outlined in the treatment plan. Most seriously:\n\n* They administered **Clozapine**, a high-risk antipsychotic, even after I revoked consent multiple times both verbally and in writing.\n* His **white blood cell count dropped to 0.0** — they didn’t inform me for three days, didn’t follow emergency protocol, and didn’t document it properly.\n* At one point, they **catheterized him while he was physically restrained**, without informing me or getting consent.\n* I have reason to believe they are **not following Texas laws** regarding restraint use or documentation. There is little to no documentation of the incidents in his official medical record, despite multiple Code Greens (behavioral emergencies).\n\nI’ve been told that Texas malpractice laws are difficult — that unless there’s a death or major financial injury, attorneys won’t pursue cases like this due to the cap on damages. I’ve also been advised that this could involve **systemic Medicaid fraud**, as they were billing for therapy services that were not being provided.\n\n**Questions:**\n\n1. Could this rise to the level of **medical battery** or **civil rights violations**?\n2. Do I have any legal options under Texas law as his legal guardian, especially regarding informed consent?\n3. Who regulates or enforces **restraint laws in residential hospitals**?\n4. If I have documentation of **Medicaid fraud** (billing for services never delivered), can I report that myself, or do I need an attorney to file a whistleblower case?\n5. What kind of lawyer should I be looking for — malpractice, civil rights, healthcare fraud?\n\nI’m trying to figure out the best legal route to hold this facility accountable. Any guidance would be appreciated.",

The closing attorney was chosen by NACA.\n\nTwo days ago, I got a 5-figure tax bill in the mail for failure to file IRS form 8288. Apparently, the seller of the house was a foreigner or non-U.S. resident, and because of that, I, as the buyer, was supposed to withhold %10 of the purchase price and have it sent to the IRS to ensure the taxes on the sale are paid because the U.S. can’t track down anyone outside of the country and make them pay taxes. \n\nThe problem is that nowhere in my home-buying process was this Form and tax implication brought up to me. My research shows that usually closing attorneys are the ones who check and regulate these things, have the forms signed, and send the check to the IRS at closing.\n\nI’ve reached out to the closing attorney and NACA and am waiting to hear back. In the event that they try to wiggle out of responsibility for this, what legal recourse do I have? I do not think I should be responsible for this.\n\nTl;dr: My real estate broker/agent and closing attorney did not handle an aspect of closing on my house that has caused me a SERIOUS tax implication 3 years later.  I do not think I should be held liable for something that should have been taken care of at closing. Isn’t that what the attorney is for?",

How do I advocate this? I went through all the papers in her house and I don't have any receipts or anything. I only have emails where she talked about these things.",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nMy dad has been in the ICU of an Ontario hospital, and during his stay, he developed a stage 4 pressure sore — it’s now so advanced that bone is exposed.\n\nI’ve been at the hospital every day, constantly advocating for his care. Earlier this year, after another medical issue, he was discharged from the same hospital with a stage 3 pressure sore. After a long and challenging couple of months caring for the wound, it healed and sealed completely. But then he got readmitted for another health complication last month and his pressure wound resurfaced and is now at the current stage 4.\n\nBecause of his previous pressure sore experience at the same hospital, I've always been on top of it with advocating from day one, reminding staff about the importance of repositioning him, requested proper wound care and prevention measures, and offered suggestions based on years of experience caring for him at home. He never had a pressure sore under my care\nSome nurses were open to feedback, but many ignored my concerns, it feels like. They were more focused on the primary medical reason of admission, rather than preventing pressure sores and other health complications. I’ve spoken with nearly every staff member I could. I followed up frequently on the sore’s progress and was repeatedly told it was “healing” — but in reality, it kept worsening. Now we're at this severe and heartbreaking point.\n\nI’m really angry, exhausted, and feeling defeated. To me, this is a clear case of negligence. I understand that pressure sores are complex and influenced by overall health but I have personally seen nurses failing to reposition him properly — leaving him still sitting on his coccyx for long periods of time, or placing pillows in ways that actually caused more pressure instead of relief.\n\nWe’ve spoken with a manager who apologized and admitted this should never have happened. I’ve also emailed patient services and some doctors. Since then, care has improved somewhat, but I still see ongoing lapses — some staff still don’t reposition him properly or miss obvious signs. There is no clear standard of wound prevention and care other than changing bandages and dressing.\n\nHas anyone here dealt with a similar situation? What are my options now?\n\n1. Should I escalate to a patient advocacy group? Anyone know of who I can talk to in Ontario?\n\n2. Is filing a formal complaint worthwhile? How? \n\n3. Is legal action even a realistic or meaningful path or is it just a draining uphill battle?\n\nI feel like there has to be some accountability — not just for what happened, but to prevent it from happening to someone else’s loved one. Any guidance, personal experience, or advice would be so appreciated.\n\nThank you for reading.\n\nLocation: Ontario, Canada.",

      "content": "Location: New York, New York\n\nHi all,\n\nI’m a federal civilian employee (GS) working at a U.S. Coast Guard Sector. I’m looking for legal guidance on what I believe is ongoing retaliation tied to protected activity — and whether the steps being taken against me (and others) are legally defensible.\n\n⸻\n\nHere’s what’s happening:\n\t•\tSeveral civilian employees, including myself, have filed EEO complaints related to a hostile work environment.\n\t•\tSome of us have also used FMLA leave due to the health effects of that environment.\n\t•\tNow, those same employees are being processed for removal — in some cases abruptly, and without any meaningful performance or conduct issues.\n\t•\tEmployees are being marked AWOL for using sick leave — even when we have leave available — unless we submit a doctor’s note. This policy isn’t applied across the board, only to those involved in complaints or grievances.\n\nIt feels very clearly like selective enforcement of policy as retaliation.\n\n\n\n⸻\n\nWhat makes this more concerning:\n\nI’ve already contacted the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) and submitted documentation. But leadership seems to be moving ahead anyway, confident they can finish removing us or keeping us silent before OSC has time to intervene. The attitude is basically: “By the time they get involved, you’ll already be gone.”\n\nThere’s a sense they believe they can act with impunity simply because the enforcement mechanism is slow.\n\n⸻\n\nMy legal questions:\n\t1.\tCan an agency selectively enforce medical documentation requirements only against employees engaged in protected activity?\n\t2.\tDoes marking someone AWOL (despite having leave) rise to the level of retaliation under EEO or FMLA law?\n\t3.\tAre there immediate legal protections I should invoke while OSC is still processing the complaint?\n\t4.\tIf I’m terminated before OSC or EEOC can act, what recourse do I still have — and does it strengthen the retaliation claim?\n\n       5.   Are there any other questions I should be asking? Other than why do you still work there?\n⸻\n\nI’m documenting everything, but the pace of retaliation is outpacing the normal protective channels. Any legal insight — or direction on what else I can or should be doing right now — would be incredibly helpful.\n\nFor what it’s worth, we did have a labor union but the president executive order has DHS telling the Coast Guard informally to not acknowledge or participate with union. This means several grievances, unfair labor practice, are going unaddressed. Unfortunately, several of them existed before the EO which are now all mute.\n\nThank you in advance.\n",

      "content": "Location: Connecticut\n\nI hosted a party inside my house in a residential neighborhood. Around 11pm, cops pulled over an unrelated person in a vehicle outside my house on the main road. No idea as to why, they were neither coming to nor leaving my residence. About 5 law enforcement vehicles ended up showing up, it seemed like a whole ordeal. About 30-45 minutes after we first noticed the lights outside, there was pounding on my front door. \n\nI opened the door and asked what the problem was. Officer stated they could hear screams coming from inside the residence and wanted to come in and check that everybody was safe. (We were playing Fortnite and listening to music, so maybe volume was audible from outside, but it was a very chill party - no screaming or anything). I politely denied entry, explained I was having a party. I said whatever is going on in the street is not related to this, nobody else is coming to and nobody is leaving my party. \n\nOfficer asked again to come inside and I politely declined, asking if I could return to my party or if he needed something from me. He said he needed to see my ID, which I had in my bedroom and not on my person. I asked why, he said because he has to ID me or come inside. I said ok to ID, I have to go get it, please wait here. Shut the door, got my ID, returned to the door, showed him, he shined the flashlight on it for 1-2 seconds and then said to be quiet and left.\n\nNothing became of it. I’m not upset or looking for problems, which is why I showed my ID. I have nothing to hide and even if they did come inside they would see a bunch of nerds playing games. But, was I legally required to identify myself? Situation seemed very strange overall. The officer was young, seemed extremely agitated/aggressive from the very first encounter when I opened the door. I was calm and respectful the entire time. Again, it just seemed really strange. I didn’t mind IDing myself just so they would leave, but it seemed unnecessary. He never mentioned a noise complaint or any reason besides he heard screaming? Never logged my information, ran the ID, issued a warning, or transferred any paperwork. Thanks",

He said he had some \"documents for me,\" and I told him to go away because I was already in bed.

He postponed the trial because he had a trip to China, and we're finally going to court this Friday.\n\nSince I never received a copy, I do worry the judge will not let me object to his evidence submission.

To summarize, it sounds like even though he was trying to provide his evidence after the 10 day threshold, he is still allowed to and I can ask the judge to excluded his evidence due to lack of time to review and respond. The judge still has discretion to allow him to submit it, which puts me at a significant preparatory disadvantage, so I can request a recess to review or file a continuation to delay the hearing until I've had sufficient time to review the case.",

My apartment complex called me the other day to ask if they could work on my AC unit, I said sure even though it was working fine I assumed they just needed to make some adjustments. I come home from work, not only is it not working now, but they did not leave a note or any sort of follow up that it was serviced. They even took the batteries out of the thermostat and did not replace them…so I bought new ones. Regardless, even with the thermostat batteries only the screen turned on and no AC. It was a wonderful 84 degrees all night in the apartment.\n\nThis morning I march into the leasing office in frustration, explaining how I wasn’t followed up with. They say they would send someone out, and they did. This time they actually leave a note and document it in the resident portal, but they didn’t fix it. I go back to the leasing office and they say they’ll send someone out in the morning.\n\nThis is now 48 hours of no AC. I told them it’s 84 degrees and they brushed it off.\n\nCould this fall under breach of habitability or anything like that?\n\nThanks.\n",

      "content": "Location: Delaware, USA\n\nLast week (Tuesday 05/27 to Friday 05/30) I stayed at a hotel in Delaware. I brought with me a kids pillow that my late grandma gifted me when I was born (I’m now in my early 30s). I recently moved to the US and before that I lived in 4 different countries, the pillow was always with me. It followed me everywhere, I slept on it, I cried holding it and wherever I am it reminds me of home.. the sentimental value is immeasurable. I know I know, forgetting it there was my fault, I checked out in a rush, it’s white and so it blended with the color of the bedsheets and I just didn’t see it. I’m now back home (a different state) and I’ve looked for it for 2 days with no luck so I called the hotel and the person at the reception told me they didn’t find anything. After a little while my husband called them back and they said the cleaning supervisor did in fact find it when the room was cleaned (last Friday) and put it on their lost and found shelf.. but it disappeared. They said they are going to look everywhere for it, even in the dumpster. My question is, now that we have established that the pillow was indeed there but now it’s not anymore, what can be done? What if they can’t find it?",

I just want to know if there’s anything we can do so that we don’t lose all the equity in the house (although it is a complete piece of shit anyways, should probably be condemned.) also my minor brother and adult brother live there currently and definitely cannot afford a place on their own at this point.

      "content": "Location: South Carolina\n\nSo long story short. My mother can be very hysterical. Back in 2023, her ex boyfriend at the time had bought her a new car, so she let me and my brother use her old one.\n\n We picked up our siblings from school, got food, the basic older sibling stuff. Eventually I even began to use the car to visit my grandmothers (about an hour away from me and my mother). One of the days I did, I had a pair of shoes my mother owned. For some reason she believed I was going to steal said shoes, and panic called the police and reported the car stolen. Like I said, she can get very hysterical. I’m not the type to steal, let alone some shoes maybe worth $20 from my family. \n\nMy phone had no service, so I didn’t see the crazy spew of messages until later, and even then, she didn’t tell me the car was reported stolen. I only found that out the next time I was driving and I was arrested after a traffic stop. \n\nFast forward to now, I got arrested just last week for the same charge, different name, and different city. Im now facing grand larceny with goods over 10,000. My only guess is that the police filed a report in both cities, and it’s just now catching up to me? I’m not really sure, this legal stuff is really confusing. I’ve tried to stay on tracks very since bonding out the first time. I’ve enrolled in college, fixed my license, and began working a little. \n\nMy mother is sorry for the past, and I even got to drag her up to the old office where I was first arrested back in 2024 and we had one of the solicitors type out a request for dismissal form, I never heard anything about the case again until now, with just a different name and city. \n\nSo honestly, I just want to know what I could be facing in this case. Possible jail time? \n\n\n",

During that time, he racked up over $5,000 in traffic tickets (speeding, toll violations, red light cameras, parking violations, driving without registration, driving without insurance) all across New York. Most of the tickets were tied directly to my name, with the exception of all speeding tickets, and others have now gone to collections, tanking my credit score in the process.\n\nI’m overwhelmed and unsure how to dispute the charges and clear my record without pressing criminal charges or sending my son to jail. I don’t want this to follow him for the rest of his life, but I also can’t afford to carry this financial burden, especially because of the other financial burdens I have right now.\n\nI have documentation proving I wasn’t driving during the violations, and I’ve started gathering evidence that the car was taken without my consent. But I don’t know what to do next, I really don’t want my son in jail. \n\nMy main questions:\n\t1.\tWhat steps can I take to dispute these tickets and clear my credit?\n\t2.\tCan I file a police report or affidavit that the car was used without permission without pressing charges?\n\t3.\tIs there a way to resolve this through traffic court or collections without legal consequences for my son?\n\t4.\tDo I need a lawyer, and if so, what kind?\n\nThank you in advance.

      "content": "Location: Los Angeles, California\n\nIF TLDR, then skip to Current Roadblock below.\n\n**What Happened:** I was driving through a project in South LA on my way home from work one day when a car cut a turn and crashed into me as I was approaching a stop sign at a T-intersection. The guy made eye-contact with me, but rather than stopping, he hit the front driver's side of my car with his, then side-swiped his car against mine. He didn't even stop until halfway down the block, then jumped out of his car and ran at me, accusing me of crashing into him. He was pretty angry, and he seemed to have a problem with me being in that area. Though I tried to reason with him, he proceeded to then sit on the hood of my car and demand we wait for police to arrive to report the accident. He had a bunch of buddies accuse me of causing the crash too. They came seemingly out of nowhere (one was sitting on a stoop, just smoking weed, and the other was in a car that was following his.) He got my license and insurance info when the police finally came to coordinate the exchange of info, and he then filed a claim against me with my insurance alleging that I was at fault...\n\nEssentially I believe this was insurance fraud and he was either an opportunist or he intentionally crashed into me to get money from my insurance. He came to my place of work later demanding to see me and threatened a staff member. He called me many times demanding a relatively small amount of money ($500), and saying he would see me in court if I did not pay... My insurance denied his claim, as I reported to them what actually happened. and then he later sued me in small claims.\n\nI was so mad, that even though he improperly served me, I countersued.\n\nLong story short, I won in court because I had pictures of the damage to my car and the damage to his, and I had pictures that show I was clearly behind the stop sign on my side of the street. So, now he owes me about 4.5K, I have had multiple debtor's exams, but of course he claims to have no income, no money in the bank, and no assets other than his car, which is worth about 7k maybe, The Judge appears to be taking his side in these Debtor's exams (Judge only ordered that he pay me $75 per month). However, the debtor did tell the judge that he gets money from family to support him and that he can pay me out of an account he made with Chase.\n\n**Current Roadblock:** The Debtor has now defaulted on his court-ordered payment plan, so I have filed the appropriate forms with the court for declaration of default.  I have also subpoenaed Chase Bank to attempt to get information regarding the debtor's accounts so that I can potentially prove at the next debtor's exam that he perjured himself and has money in the bank and income. However, I have run into a roadblock, which is that Chase Bank will not release any of the info I requested (bank account numbers, bank statements, etc,) because they have multiple accounts in their system with the same debtor's name, same date of birth, and same home address, but with different social security numbers. Thus, Chase Bank is treating these accounts as belonging to different people and is requesting that I provide them with the correct last 4 of the SSN of the debtor, which is info that I do not have. The bank has not told me this in writing (that they have multiple accounts with different SSNs for my debtor), but have only done so over the phone, so I called their subpoena department to request that they do so. I stated they I would be recording the call, but the bank representative immediately got scared and said they did not know if they could be recorded and would have to get back to me, then promptly hung up!\n\n**My Question:** My upcoming debtor's exam is in several weeks, and Chase Bank is still refusing to provide me with the Debtor's banking information because they have multiple accounts with different SSNs but with matching name, DOB, and home address for the Debtor.\n\n1. I suspect the debtor may be engaging in some kind of fraud, but is the bank still legally obligated to provide me with all banking info that I have requested in my subpoena for the debtor's accounts, even if they have different SSNs in their system for my debtor?\n2. On my subpoena, I checked the box that states the bank is not required to send a representative to appear in person at the next debtor's exam if they provide the records to me. However, since they are not complying (for the above reason), am I correct that they will legally be required to send a representative to court for the next hearing?\n3. If I can prove to the judge that the Debtor is using multiple SSNs for accounts with the bank, will this help me at all? Is there anything the judge can do to either compel the bank to provide me the banking info of the debtor or to compel the debtor to provide me with his account numbers or last 4 digits of the SSNs he is using for his bank accounts?\n4. Should I reach out to the DA about this?",

She works for a company in the entertainment industry, employee count is 2 with her and the owner, setting up DJs and musicians for various events. With some of the events, it is necessary for her or the owner to attend in-person to these events. She normally works from home 95% of the time, outside of attending some industry networking events that are work sanctioned.\n\nShe is a part-time and hourly, a W2.\n\n Last year, she went to about 4, but was never compensated for gas nor travel time. Thankfully, most of them are at the closest venue that they are typically at, about 45 minutes away. The owner said that it is because it's under an hour travel and the musicians they line-up also do not get compensated if it is under an hour, even though they get a contract and one-time payout for the gig.\n\nRecently, her boss, the owner, has been sending her on more events. My wife ate the gas/time last year but we're now looking at 10 between now and September. All are under an hour, but she did ask for compensation, either gas or time, and was denied.\n\nFrom my reading of the Department of Labor, it seems that this toes the line on compensation and I'd like to get some more legal or labor opinions here if this would be considered wage left. At bare minimum, I think she should be getting compensated for gas. When I traveled for work, I think it was $0.49 per mile, and my employer paid this.\n\nThank you!",

      "content": "Location: Kentucky\n\nHi, I posted this in an insurance Reddit but that was apparently a mistake. My mother is dealing with a home insurance claim because squatters burnt her house down after my father passed away. My dad’s name was never taken off the insurance, so the check was made out to the estate of his name. And now she needs to go to court and prove he didn’t have a living will because he passed very suddenly. And I was basically wondering if someone could give me more information about how this process will go and what information I can give my mother during this process, if any of the money is going to go to me for the emotional distress of losing my home, which I know is not usually considered I’m literally just asking. (Sorry my last post got one dude saying I should be disowned for asking for more info 😂) and I’m just mainly wanting more information to give my mother to see how long this will take so I can give her some peace of mind ",

      "content": "Location: Colorado\n\n I am an adult male. I live in Colorado. My mom has been married to her husband for about 13 years, but they have been broken up for a year and have been in the process of getting a divorce. I moved back in with my mom to help her with her kids about a year ago as well, but I was only gone for a couple years prior to live with a roommate. They are divorcing because my stepdad was unfaithful, and verbally and physically abusive to my mom. He owns a company, and he kissed my sister (I have multiple sisters, and I will refer to her as Sister A) who is also his stepdaughter, while she was drunk and they were on a work trip. He also got with several women at his workplace and my mom was informed of it. He also ruined the relationship between my mom and Sister B because he keeps in contact with her and pays her rent for whatever tasks he has her do, which frankly can not be anything good. \n\nSince being broken up, my stepdad has not supported my mom with the two kids (both still minors) they had together. He has not visited them. He has not helped financially with them. He does not speak to them. He does not feed them. He does not take them to school. He does absolutely nothing for those kids, and my mom and I have been supporting them. \n\nMy stepdad does not have his papers to be here legally. He had a DACA I believe that is now expired. He was in the process of getting legal papers whilst being with my mom, and is trying to gaslight her to stay married to him until he does get his papers. He is promising to allow her to keep the house (the one I live in right now with my mom and the kids, he does not live here now) and also a truck that they have. My mom is very easily manipulated, and she won't listen to me. He has since then taken her authorization off from the joint bank account they shared that had over $50,000 dollars in it. \n\nAbout two days ago, he sent people to the house to build a new fence. My mom asked him why. He said he is going to sell the house and that we all need to leave. We have been paying bills to live here for years now. His kids also live here. We also have 5 dogs. \n\nI need help knowing legally what I can do to fight this on order to continue to live in this house with my mom, my younger siblings, and my dogs. What are my potential options? Can he legally kick us all out like this? What can I do legally do in my position to stop this from happening, and bringing this to court, even if my mom is not listening to me? She has no urgency to figure this out. \n\nFor some more context, me, Sister A, Sister B, and Brother A all have the same mom, but different dads, and we are all over 18. Sister C, and Brother B are both his and my mom's kids, and they are both minors that are still in school. Sister A and B do not live with us, but the rest of my siblings do. Thank you Reddit!",

      "content": "Location: WA state. I am planning to sign a lease with 5 other roommates in a college town. The lease for this house has a lot of concerning language that I’m worried might violate the residential landlord-tenant act. First off, when paying rent the landlord asks for it to be paid in a single amount through PayPal friends and family (the only other option that does not cause additional fees is delivering a check to a bank.) \n\nNext there is in my opinion an extreme guest policy, “Unless otherwise agreed in writing, guests of Residents, no more than two (2), may occupy the rental unit no longer than two (2) days every month. Longer stays without written approval by management will be a violation of this rental agreement, and subject to an increased rent amount of $400 a month.” I’m unsure if this is violating any laws. \n\nNow for this one I understand that landlord can put no party rules in the lease but I was unsure if there was anything against excessive fines, “36. Parties: Loud and/or large parties will not be allowed.  Any violation of this provision will result in a fine of $2000 and or eviction.” \n\nCan a landlord also charge you for professional cleaning upon moving out? I thought normal wear was the landlords responsibility not the tenants. \n\nLastly, there is this section that I do not understand that sounds not very legal please help, “REMOVAL OF PROPERTY: Resident agrees not to remove or alter in any way owner’s property without specific written permission from the owner. Any removal or alteration of owners’ property without permission is grounds for termination of this agreement. Owner may take immediate possession and exclude Residents from the property, storing all Residents possessions at Resident’s expense pending reimbursement in full for owner’s loss and damages.”\n\nThank you, \nA college kid trying to understand adult things\n",

      "content": "Location:  Missouri\n\nI apologize for the long comment.\n\nDecember 2024, my neighbor decided to clear and dredge his somewhat large pond. That day, I looked out my window and saw a section of my property flooded with pond water and silt run-off. We were never informed that they planned to work on the pond nor advised us that there maybe some pond water run-off. We had that section of our property graded and seeded prior to that incident and got it to a point to where we can mow it. We are unable to mow it now because of the silt left behind from the run-off making it impossible to pass over without getting a vehicle stuck.\n\nFast forward to today, the tenant that is renting the property with the pond has been mowing that section we have been trying to restore since the pond breakage. My husband and I have been biting our lips about the tenant encroaching on our property and mowing that particular section. On Sunday, June 1st, the tenant got his mower stuck on that same section and my husband had to help pull him out. The area was heavily rutted from his mower being stuck. Not even an apology or thank you was said. That made us furious.\n\nSo I wrote the tenant a note to include aerial shots of our property line from the county assessor’s office and asked that he not mow the area we are trying to restore. His landlord contacted us the same day, furious that we made that complaint. \n\nMy question is, was the landowner supposed to get some sort of permit to work on such a large scale project and to notify the landowners adjacent to the property that might get affected should something go wrong? Not only did the run-off ruined our grass but also transferred to another neighbors pond. Are there any environmental recourse with the said landowners  not going through the proper channels before they decided to dredge their pond? Landowner verbally told my husband that he will remedy the issue with our ruined grass. Here we are today, nothing as been done and now with the tenant encroaching and the mower rutting on our property was the last straw. \n\nThe landowner is upset with us because we complained. The landowner called my husband and made it seem like we created this problem when all we wanted to do was let the tenant know not to mow that section. This whole ordeal has gotten out of hand and now he is threatening to sue us for something we did not do in the first place. \n\nAre we in the wrong for voicing our concerns in the first place? I am sure the landowner had no clue the tenant was mowing our property without his knowledge. We could have complained when the first incident happened with the pond giving way to the city or environmental agency but wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt to make things right like he promised us back in December. We wanted to give the tenant the courtesy to stop mowing our section. Tenant brought it up to the landowner and now we are the bad guys. \n\nPlease advise.\n\n",

      "content": "Location: California\nBeen working at a Boba shop for about a year now, but my boss/ceo has been always paying us our tips extremely late. We’ve had a lot of people complaining in work group chats and discussed it with our other manager staff, as well as the CEO on a group chat, but they constantly wave it off and say they’re working on it. We’ve all considered reaching out to the labor commissioner to file a complaint but the paperwork is too long and confusing. Would a class action lawsuit be the best solution? All of my coworkers have also been getting them late. If so, how would I approach this, and how would the attorney process work? Would I also be able to sue them to cover my legal fees?",

I’ve submitted them to the police as evidence and started the process of a restraining order.. But to be honest, I haven’t touched it in a little over a month. I’d started calling the cops every time he started getting over the top so he dialed way back. Tonight though, he reminded me why I started doing all of that in the first place.

      "content": "Location: Freelancers all around the world, but company is based in Oregon\n\nHi everyone.\n\nI'm a freelancer and I used to freelance for a website which has been going through a number of layoffs and big changes in how it does things. It laid off almost all of its full time staff in January and then last month had another round of \"layoffs\" where it told the lion's share of freelancers that their assignments were \"on pause\". So not technically layoffs, as you can't really lay a freelancer off, but it was clear what they meant when they closed up our work accounts immediately. \n\nSince then, one invoice has come due and we were told they were waiting on payments from their advertisers before they could pay us. That was midway through May. Since then, our rope has been jerked a whole lot, culminating in an email stating that a \"partial payment\" would be sent out. \n\nThat partial payment has amounted to roughly 5% of the owed amounts for those freelancers \"on pause\", with 10-12.5% for those who still work for the company. \n\nIt seems pretty clear to me that we won't get this money by simply waiting for them to pay up, and it seems clear they're in very dire straits and likely threatened with bankruptcy. There are a number of us all affected by this, and we're spread all across the world, from the U.S. and Canada, to the UK, and as far out as India. What are our legal options that we can take against a company based in Oregon? As far as my cursory (IANAL) inspection goes, Oregon's laws aren't great for freelancers, so are there other routes we can take? \n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks.",

      "title": "Advice for TRO final hearing defense in PA. My ex claims I was stalking malicious or otherwise.",
      "content": "Hello all, I’m Oliver! I’ll try to make this as short as possible.\n\nLocation: PA\n\nI lived exclusively with my ex for several months. Near the end of our last lease, I used my savings from before I knew her, to pay three months of her portion of the bills— and much more. We both returned to PA together on my dime in June/July after our lease ended; we were pregnant. We moved in with my cousin and started working.\n\nIn September, things were getting worse as my grandma, who also lived with us, died. We all prepared to vacate the house, as it was an interim home for everyone. I still didn’t have any savings, and with all the death (yes, the little one sadly), love between us seemed tenuous at best. I moved back into my old apartment building; she moved to a one-bedroom half-studio in another part of town.\n\nWe continued to see each other. Things weren’t always fun or easy, but we maintained regular or irregular correspondence and intimacy — definitively through January 1st. Before New Year’s, I directly shared with her my intent for the next year, both for myself and with her. I explained that my goal in bringing her around my current group of friends was to make roots. I asked if there were any details of her with other partners — not out of anger, but in an attempt to clear any doubts and inform her of my renewed commitment to our relational success.\n\nShe lied, and I found out. After having sex on January 1st, when everything seemed so right, her phone kept getting messages. I asked, and she eventually shared that things had happened. I didn’t care about the context or actions. I explained that what hurt was the lie — and that anything but an apology was unacceptable.\n\nShe didn’t like that. She felt like I was trying to control her freedom again. I left frustrated and returned on the 9th with a letter stating my frustrations and lamentations. It may have included harsh final-encounter language — statements I regret, as I encouraged no contact because I needed to move on from the deceit.\n\nShe was hurt and asked me to leave. I did — sad, frustrated, and upset mostly with myself. Shortly after, I began to grieve heavily. Not just her, but also my grandmother and our aborted child. Even now, I still grieve their loss.\n\nSince the 9th, when I delivered that letter, we maintained communication until I was blocked on the 17th or 18th — maybe. On the 19th, I’m embarrassed to admit, I went to visit after midnight, unannounced — as I had done occasionally before. However, this time, she didn’t respond and had me blocked. I called three times from different VoIP numbers on my phone to confirm I was blocked.\n\nI threw a few snowballs at her window, as I suspected she was asleep. Still no response, so I climbed her fire escape — maybe she didn’t see or hear the snowballs. Again, I viewed this as normal behavior between us because just a couple of months earlier, she had broken my basement door after unsuccessfully climbing my fire escape trying to get into my building. Our roles were basically reversed.\n\nNot justifying my behavior — just explaining my logic, because I didn’t see it as invasive at the time.\n\nAfter knocking for a short while, I realized she didn’t want me there. So I began to leave. I got to the bottom steps, and the police were waiting outside. They asked why I was there, and I told them my intent — showed the plant and shared why I had come. They said she had called scared, and the police asked me to leave because my presence was not desired. I complied immediately and shared my surprise and sadness at that outcome, which I considered to be an extreme measure.\n\nAfter a short period — maybe two weeks — I forgave her and attempted to reconcile again, being sure not to make the mistake of visiting without permission. At this point, she was a stone wall, blocking everything after I messaged her. All but one medium: Chime bank, where we sent monthly maximum overdraft boosts. I’m sure she would have blocked that too, but she still sent this voluntary boost on Jan 9, Feb 12, and Mar 1.\n\nI miss her still — even now. But on Feb 22, I emailed her. A very neutral and loving message in my opinion. No response.\n\nI did again a week later on March 2 — more vulnerable and open with my feelings, expressing love, loss, and acceptance. I had already begun to assume I was blocked there too. Another message on the 3rd — sharing how she probably doesn’t get those as I was likely blocked there too. One final email on the 6th — realizing her apathy toward me had reached new heights.\n\nIn my last week of work, I learned sometime in February she changed her number and still managed to keep her current phone and previous bills in my name. I know I resolved my accounts with T-Mobile because I switched to Verizon the previous year. I have a $600+ T-Mobile bill from her — only her, phone and service.\n\nI reached out with one message to each of the three people I knew her to be close with — her coupled exes and her mother. I also left one voicemail with her mom about the unpaid bill — asking if they could encourage her to reach out and get this resolved with me or at least with T-Mobile.\n\nAfter leaving work, I stopped at the police station to see if I could stop by her home to hopefully discuss the bill and even requested an escort, citing that she had called them last time. After their hasty approval, I stopped by, and since it was chilly, the sun setting, and I had my motorcycle, I only knocked on the door a few times before leaving.\n\nI returned after 5 p.m. with my car and stayed parked while speaking with the same cousin we had lived with. Before getting the chance to wrap up the call and attempt to knock again, the police were called again. This time, they were far less communicative and respectful of both our perspectives. She was immediately seen as a victim, and all my requests for dialogue denied. I was asked to leave, and I complied. I have had zero contact since.\n\n⸻\n\nIf you made it this far, thank you. I’m sure it will all workout in the end.\n\nHere are her statements for the PFA:\n\t•\tJanuary 19, 2025 – 1:52 AM:\n\t•\tThe reporting party claims the respondent repeatedly contacted them using unknown numbers after being blocked.\n\t•\tA voicemail was allegedly left stating the respondent was outside and wanted to talk.\n\t•\tThe respondent allegedly threw snow at the bedroom window and looked through it.\n\t•\tIt is claimed they entered the building’s basement and knocked on the door for about 10 minutes without response.\n\t•\tThe reporting party called police, and the respondent was removed.\n\t•\tFollowing January 19, 2025:\n\t•\tThe respondent allegedly continued contact attempts through platforms such as gaming networks, a language learning app, and social media.\n\t•\tA fake account was reportedly created to reach the reporting party.\n\t•\tThe reporting party changed their phone number; however, the respondent allegedly resumed contact through email.\n\t•\tFebruary 22, 2025:\n\t•\tThe respondent allegedly emailed the reporting party, expressing difficulty staying away and a desire to remain in contact even without responses.\n\t•\tAccording to the report, three additional emails were sent afterward.\n\t•\tThe reporting party claims one email included a statement that the respondent would remain outside their residence daily at noon until they responded.\n\t•\tMarch 5, 2025 – 12:34 PM:\n\t•\tA text message was allegedly sent to the reporting party’s mother from an unknown number, mentioning an unpaid phone bill appearing on the respondent’s credit.\n\t•\tThe reporting party’s mother did not respond.\n\t•\tMarch 7, 2025 – 2:55 PM:\n\t•\tThe respondent reportedly arrived uninvited at the reporting party’s apartment, knocked for 5 minutes, and left after no response.\n\t•\tMarch 8, 2025 – Approximately 5:30 PM:\n\t•\tThe respondent allegedly returned and sat outside the apartment.\n\t•\tThe reporting party called the police.\n\t•\tDuring the police interaction, the respondent reportedly requested $600 for a phone bill.\n\t•\tThe reporting party stated the account was in their name and that the respondent agreed to pay the balance since it was on their credit.\n\t•\tThe officer advised the reporting party to file for a Protection From Abuse (PFA) order.\n\n⸻\n\nAdditional testimony:\n\t•\tThe reporting party testified the respondent left one voicemail and sent text messages from three different numbers.\n\t•\tThey clarified they did not respond or allow the respondent to visit.\n\t•\tPolice were contacted, but no criminal charges were filed.\n\t•\tThe relationship lasted from November 2022 to July 2024 (approx. 1 year and 8 months).\n\t•\tThe reporting party testified:\n\t•\tThe respondent expressed suicidal ideation in February 2025, saying they should not be alone.\n\t•\tThey felt unsafe as a result.\n\t•\tThe respondent was allegedly controlling throughout the relationship.\n\nThis was filed March 11.\n\n⸻\n\nThoughts?

The manager greeted me and stared at me for a while. I asked him if they were hiring, as I was desperate for work and honestly very hungry. He said yes and told me to come back in an hour so we could talk. He gave me his phone number and said to sit with him later. I thought he was just being kind.\n\nWhen I came back and we sat down to talk, he said, “The real reason I wanted to talk to you is because I like you.” I was confused, and he said, “Of course I’m gay.” Then he began making extremely inappropriate comments, asking things like: “How big is your d\\*\\*\\*?”, “Haven’t you ever experimented with guys? Are you sure?”, “I’d love to give you a bl\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*.”, “It’s big, right?” “I like the ones that look like you, young” , Even after I asked him multiple times to drop it, he kept going, saying disgusting things like, “I’d love to see you c\\*\\*.” He said other things too, I don’t fully remember and honestly prefer to block out, but I know they were extremely disgusting.\n\nHe also strongly implied that he could “help me out” or pay me if I did sexual favors for him. He told me that if I needed a place to stay, I could live with him. It was very clear that he realized I was in a vulnerable situation and tried to take advantage of that. I felt extremely uncomfortable, but I was so hungry that I stayed just to eat something before I left. Honestly, the whole thing made me lose my appetite , I felt like vomiting.\n\nThis happened in Boston, Massachusetts and I’m wondering if I have any legal options. I didn’t report it at the time because I was ashamed and confused, but I’ve been thinking about it a lot and feel like what happened was very wrong. After that day, he texted me several times asking if I was upset or if he had made me uncomfortable. I ended up deleting the messages because the whole situation made me feel extremely uncomfortable. If possible, I would like to cooperate with the authorities. I’m a foreigner and a young person going through difficult times, and I’m sure this isn’t the first time that man has done this or taken advantage of people in vulnerable situations. It's been a few months now, and he hasn’t contacted me since. Do I still have any options to report this or take action?",

I paid via credit card, and I attempted to file a charge back or report fraud when it became clear I wouldn't be receiving my product, but was unfortunately told by my CC company that I was past the window to file, and there was nothing they could do\n\nI posted in a Facebook group for comissioner reviews, and was met with over a dozen other people who are in similar situations to me. \n\nThe issue that most of us have is that we don't live in the same country as the seller, so aren't sure what to do. I tried contacting their local police department and the Better Business Bureau, and had no response.\n\nI've talked to a few people who have said that because it's international, it's tricky, but also because the seller owes clients thousands of dollars in refunds for not fulfilling their end of the sale, that the seller should be able to be held accountable.\n\nI would love any suggestions on what to do next! Thanks in advance.\n\nObligatory apologies for any weird formatting, I'm posting from the mobile app!",

      "content": "Location: Missouri\n\nTo start, I'm hoping I can explain this the best way I can.\n\nLast week I received my bi-weekly check which had 31 hours of prevailing wage on it. After some negotiations early on in the year when this project was under bidding, I informed my company of the PW rates at which we should be at. I am in low voltage. Data cabling, fiber, security, network infrastructure, etc....(I am not apart of and ISP). I am aware my role has a fine line at which I can be considered either a telecommunications tech or inside wireman when comes to PW. The one thing I do and can do is install EMT conduit, which classifies me as the inside wireman if I install over 10ft of conduit. This project I am on is installing security cameras for a school district and I will be doing conduit as needed since there is no certified electrician on-site. 2 years ago, we did a part of this same district and I was paid at the inside wireman rate. The first week of me being on-site this time, I was paid at the inside wireman rate. This week comes along after being paid last week for the PW, my company is now telling me they paid me at the wrong rate and I shouldve been paid at the telecommunications tech rate, which about $50/hr lower, and saying I need to pay back their mistake. I have evidence of what the rate I was told as I was built this project from ground up. They are also saying that they can only honor the higher rate for whenever I am technically installing conduit, in which there is no way to effectively distinguish different job roles for me. \n\n  \nAre they allowed to do any of this? I am looking for advice because I feel they are looking for loopholes to get away with it because they decided to overlook and brush me off in the beginning and now theyre mad that they wont make any profit off this project, which is around a 400k security project.",

      "content": "\nI lived in a house in Arizona where I rented a private room. The landlord also lived on the property. During the lease, he locked the thermostat, restricting my access to A/C, even during 110+ degree days. There were stretches where temperatures inside my room reached over 90°F, despite me unplugging all my electronics. I kept a 5-gallon jug of water in my room and at times felt dizzy or overheated while working remotely.\n\nHe never offered a solution or brought up any alternative cooling options.\n\nThere were also other issues:\n\t•\tI was told I could use weed in the home, and he and his friends smoked too — but now he’s retroactively using that as a reason to blame me.\n\n\t•\tI helped him with favors constantly (letting in his friends, helping with house errands, even lending him gear), but he later accused me of being disrespectful or unreliable.\n\n\t•\tWhen I tried to maintain peace and just finish out the lease, he stopped communicating and began acting passive-aggressively.\n\t•\tI paid on time or just 1–2 days late with notice and covered any minor damage myself with receipts/proof.\n\n\t•\tWhen I moved out, I left a mattress (he never asked me to move it) and included extra funds to cover cleaning and damages — more than what a junk hauler would’ve charged.\n\nNow, months later, I’m considering filing a small claims case for around $8,500 in damages and rent reimbursement related to unsafe living conditions and possible retaliation. I’ve also spoken to other landlords and therapists who all agree the situation was unacceptable and borderline illegal.\n\nThe only reason I waited this long was because I was unsure I had a case — and honestly, I felt intimidated and financially stuck. I was living out of my car after moving out while holding down a full-time job remotely.\n\n\nQuestions:\n\n\t•\tDo I have a case for constructive eviction or breach of habitability?\n\n\t•\tCould the court view my delay in filing as unreasonable?\n\n\t•\tWhat kind of proof do I need — are photos of thermostats and text messages enough?\n\n\n\t•\tIf he tries to argue I caused drama or minor issues, how much does that actually hurt my case?\n\n\t•\tWould asking for $8,500 seem unreasonable if I have documentation of lost income and physical discomfort?\n\nMy location: Arizona",

      "title": "Nursing Job Bait & Switch, and Worker Discrimination",
      "content": "I recently left my job in Philadelphia after many issues regarding things that I’m pretty sure are illegal. I want to know if it would be worth pursuing a law suit and hiring a lawyer or if it would be a dead end. \n\nSome background, I’m a new graduate RN and my first job was pretty devastating to my mental health. I’ve struggled with mental health issues for a while, even to the point where I had to disclose it with the hospital job I was initially in. While I was there with them, they were very considerate of me and I negotiated with HR about accommodations. Ultimately, the job just wasn’t conducive to what I could handle so I decided to look for another job. \n\nI found a residential eating disorder facility that I was interested in and got an offer from. It was a massive pay cut but I thought it would be better because it was 5 8-hour shifts instead of the 3 12s I was doing. At least that’s what was on my offer letter and the job listing. \n\nI intended to put in my two weeks at the first job at the hospital, but had to go to a PHP (partial hospitalization program) urgently for 2 weeks which I disclosed to my manager there. I also let my new job know, via email, that I had to push back my start date due to “medical treatment” that I didn’t specify in as mental health related.  They seemed understanding and I started after the PHP concluded. \n\nThey essentially bait and switched me and I wasn’t offered work the hours that were listed on my first offer letter. First, they insisted I had to work, consecutively a 12, an 8, 2 days off, another 12, an 8,  4 days off, and then a 12, an 8, a 12, an 8, a 12, a 12, and an 8. This required me to work 60 hours and numerous twelves in a 7 day period, although the weird shift distribution made it so I wouldn’t get any overtime. I had to negotiate a lot for a schedule that wouldn’t be 40+ in a row. They told me if I wanted 8s as I was offered, I would need to work 8 days in a row before I would get a break.  Even still what I settled for was 3 8s and a 12 which is significantly hours less than 5 8s. I only ended up with 36 hours a week instead of the 40 I was supposed to have. I also disclosed that the reason I needed 8s was so I could be in treatment in the evenings, and the schedule they gave me forced me to miss multiple days of treatment. \n\nLong story short, they found many nit picky reasons to discipline me every couple weeks and I genuinely believe it’s because I disclosed early on I had ongoing mental health issues. My coworkers hated me and ignored me, and my management provided me no guidance or support. I feel like they just wanted me to leave because I was too much of a problem due to my need for accommodations to keep my mood stable. I requested accommodations at times, only verbally, and they didn’t really take it seriously. I felt safe to share this as another nurse had disclosed her suicidal ideation but I was clearly wrong. Once they’d disciplined me a third time for minor issues, I couldn’t take it any more and left. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is there’s not much of a paper trail. All mental health disclosures I made to management was verbal. Do I have a case?  I have the multiple offer letters made with different schedules, the job listing (which is still misleading), and my initial disclosure of health issues. \n\nLocation: Philadelphia, PA",

      "content": "Location: Ohio.\n\nWill try to keep short. My Aunt is in her 50’s and has been a perpetual failure at life. No drugs/alcohol or major mental issues, just a loser.\n\nA few years ago she was evicted (out of state) and moved back to our area. Unbeknownst to the rest of the family, my grandfather (in his 80’s) signed her lease as if he would be the occupant of her apartment.\n\nSince moving back she has now lost her car (repo) and multiple jobs. She is currently unemployed. My grandparents (both 80’s) have a very limited fixed-income and can no longer continue to support her financially. They are also realizing that she has been financially and emotionally manipulating them for the better part of three decades.\n\nMy aunt has electronically signed (forged) my grandfathers signature on her two previous lease renewals. Grandfather thought she was month-to-month. Grandparents want to terminate the lease, but it requires 60-day notice and $4000 penalty, according to the lease. They can afford the 60 days of rent but not the penalty.\n\nThe kicker: The leasing company has admitted they knew that my grandfather was not the occupant, which is against the lease. Since the rent was paid on time, the leasing office overlooked it. The lease renewals were sent to my aunt’s email, and my grandfather had no idea about them.\n\nWhat, if any, recourse do my grandparents have here? They do not have the money to take this to court, but they could probably afford to pay for legal help with drafting a “threatening” letter stating they will pay the remaining 60 days rent but not the penalty since the signatures were forged.\n\nThen it would be on the leasing company to call their “bluff”? \n\nIt is an unfortunate and messy situation; I’m just hoping that there is some way my grandparents can end this situation without much further financial damage.\n\nThank you for any and all help!",

      "content": "\nHi all. I’m looking for legal advice regarding an increasingly unstable living situation. \nLocation: New York State.\n\nI’m a foreign national, married to my wife (she’s a transgender woman; we’re in a same-sex marriage), and we’ve been together for over four years before I moved here. She is the biological parent to all three children in the home: two daughters from a previous relationship (ages 5 and 6), and our nonverbal autistic toddler.\n\nWhen I moved in five months ago, the agreement was that her ex (the co-parent of the older children) would stay home and handle childcare and household responsibilities. I’m physically disabled and the full-time caregiver to our toddler, so my role was meant to be supportive, helping with the girls when possible. Unfortunately, the situation has completely fallen apart, and I’m now doing more for the kids than she is.\n\n⸻\n\nIssues with the ex:\n\t•\tWorks from home and earns around $19,000/year, but doesn’t contribute financially\n\t•\tDoes no housework, and relies fully on my spouse to pay for rent, utilities, groceries, internet, her car insurance, and phone bill\n\t•\tFrequently misses or forgets school pickups, and once failed to take the 6-year-old to school at all because she “overslept” while we were out\n\t•\tEncouraged the 6-year-old to talk to “ghosts” in the house, which caused confusion and distress\n\t•\tFor about three months, she became very religious, identified as a devout Christian, and forced the 6-year-old to participate in religious activities without talking to my spouse—then dropped the religion completely, and now trolls her former pastor. The child is now confused about what to believe\n\t•\tHas started to act like our toddler is her miscarried child—her behavior toward him is unsettling and inappropriate\n\t•\tUses ChatGPT or similar AI to craft emotionally manipulative responses when confronted\n\t•\tHer room is decorated with satanic imagery and altered dolls with disturbing features that the kids have seen and been frightened by\n\t•\tMakes bizarre and concerning claims, including that she was in a romantic relationship with a deceased dictator—I have screenshots documenting this\n\t•\tWhen confronted about her behavior, she often brings up unrelated past trauma, accuses my spouse of abuse, or threatens self-harm\n\n⸻\n\nWhat I’m doing:\n\t•\tRegistered the 5-year-old for school\n\t•\tTaken the girls to every medical appointment, usually with my spouse\n\t•\tAttended every school event\n\t•\tI do all the housework, handle routines, play with the girls, and enforce rules and boundaries\n\t•\tI used my personal savings to create a sensory-friendly area, decorate all three children’s rooms, and help with groceries\n\n⸻\n\nWhat my spouse does:\n\t•\tWorks 12–16 hour shifts, five days a week\n\t•\tComes home every night and helps with either housework or the children, no matter how tired she is\n\t•\tAttends all medical appointments and stays active in parenting despite her heavy work schedule\n\t•\tCovers all financial needs for the household—including her ex, who contributes nothing and expects to stay indefinitely\n\n⸻\n\nHer ex is in her 30s and talks as if she will live with us forever. She’s not trying to become independent, and she is clearly not prioritizing the kids’ well-being. We are extremely concerned for the children’s emotional and psychological safety—especially given the instability, inappropriate behavior, and disturbing influences they are being exposed to.\n\n⸻\n\nWhat we need to know:\n\t1.\tWhat are our legal options to remove her from the home, especially since she’s not on the lease?\n\t2.\tShould we go to family court, or is this a situation for Child Protective Services?\n\t3.\tWhat’s the best way to document everything in a way that protects us legally and the children? \n\nWe’ve been trying to manage things peacefully, but this is no longer safe or sustainable. Any advice is deeply appreciated\n",

The city I live in has pretty strict leash laws and my apartment complex also has strict rules on keeping your dogs leashed. My neighbor has a bad habit of letting her dog loose in the hallway unleashed. The inevitable happened last night and he charged at me and my dog while barking at us when we were trying to enter my apartment. He scared my dog and in the process of trying to get away from him she got her leg caught in her leash and injured herself. I paid an initial 300 for her emergency vet visit and medication. The vet is recommending X-rays to make sure it’s not broken and they said that could run another 300-500. I talked with management and while the cameras did catch the dog running off leash, it unfortunately did not catch him confronting us at my door. I tried to work it out civilly with the owner to see if she would cover at the very least, half the vet bills and initially she seemed on board and said we could discuss it further. This morning management informed me that she felt unsafe and threatened by me approaching her and that I could no longer speak to her otherwise it would be a lease violation and I would get kicked out. I did file an initial report with animal control, but I’m wondering if this would even be worth taking her to small claims court. I would need to speak with the officer who wrote up the initial report in order for him to speak with management to get the information I would need to serve them. Is this even worth the hassle or should I just take the loss and try to ignore my neighbors until my lease is up at the end of the summer? Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Also not sure if it’s relevant but her dog was what looked like a golden retriever and mine is a chihuahua who also happens to be my ESA. \n\nLocation: Salt Lake City",

      "content": "Location: Los Angeles \n\nMy husband and I submitted our taxes this year and we submitted for the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit for a car we bought in January 2024. Apparently the dealership did not submit the paperwork within 3 days (or at all) to the IRS according to the new rules of 2024 and there are several people who are in the same boat. The IRS put out a fix for this specific situation so we called the dealership, walked them through the how to do it and they said they would help us. They emailed us paperwork to fill out and we sent it all back and we finished the day with an email asking to let us know when it was done. \nFast forward to today - we have called and the manager said that the owner is refusing to send in the fix. And told us if we tried to call them again, they would hang up on us - which they did. \nAlso - somewhat unrelated - about 15 minutes after our final attempt to reach them and getting hung up on, my husbands phone number was attached to a fake Craigslist ad for Free Tools in the same vicinity as the dealership - could be a coincidence but I don’t think so. They are being petty. \n\nHow do we proceed? \n\nMy thought is that the dealership/owner stole our tax credit and doesn’t want to be caught so they are playing dumb/refusing to help. \n\nHow can I turn up the heat? Is going to court the only answer? \n\nWe are looking at small claims because it’s $4000 but we are looking into whether or not the IRS will take our return without this fix done. \n\nThank you for any and all help",

      "content": "Location: Iowa\n\nWe had a family friend (general contractor) do some work on our rental property next door and his office is also across the street from us.  \nThe estimate he gave us was for $5900 (all values are rounded) and he performed some of the work over a few dates in Sept. And October 2024.  We also hired his employees and paid them directly to do some other work and to try and finish up the work he didn't finish.\nWe got a random text in February of this year saying we need to talk about the bill.  We met him and discussed what was still left to do and he gave us a folder with the invoice and some receipts, we said we would review and be in touch.  We got home and the invoice was for $28,000.  Shocked, we asked to meet to discuss the bill and a day or so later we met him and one of his workers.  He claimed it was that high due to the number of hours but he had never charged us for hours in the past, it was always by the job and that is what he said he always does.  We asked him to rework the invoice based on that, not solely based on hours and he agreed.  An hour later we got a revised invoice for $10,000 and we paid it in full that evening in person with a check, I didn't write paid in full on it but he said he would email a paid in full invoice that night.\nWell.. he never did, instead he pretended like that while conversation never happened and texted things like thanks for not paying your bill in full I'm closing my doors on Friday.  We ignored it for the most part, but 3 weeks later we got an invoice in the mail saying we owe $17,000 and it was the same invoice number but now was for the original $28,000 and he listed our $10,000 as a payment, which simply isn't true.  We text him, called, and emailed but he never responded.  Another week goes by and we get 2 emails saying we owed payment and again we responded stating it was already paid in full.  Another week goes by and we get a notice that he put a Mechanics Lien on our property but he failed to send a Commencement of Work and the lien had other facially invalid issues.  We send a demand to take action and we got a letter from his Attorney stating that while they may not pursue the mechanics line they would sue for breach of implied oral contract and unjust enrichment.  We sent a few letters back and forth with our attorney and last week they send a warning that the 30 days was almost up and if we didn't pay them $10,000 they would sue, we said thank you but no thank you.  \nWell, they sued us for the breach of implied oral contract and unjust enrichment.  We have photos that the work wasn't done, what was done was poor quality, we have the estimate, the texts and pictures of our meeting to discuss the overpriced invoice, the revised invoice he created, using the same invoice number and our check payment, along with our responses when he changed the invoice again and tried to say it was a partial payment.\nMy wife and I are gutted, we pulled our kids from his wife's daycare, I built his website and his wife's daycare website for free, and he goes ballistic and uses us? Please tell me that we have a solid defense?\n\nBtw, the lien will fall off because they didn't pursue it within the 30 days but we will be pursuing that as he filed it in bad faith and other counterclaims.\n\nThank you!",

      "title": "Court is Friday & I don't have a clue what to do about this! Scared in Virginia",
      "content": "Location: Lynchburg, Virginia \nI'm a 38 year old female from Virginia. \nThis past March I was at a local lowes with a friend of mine. He went inside the store first. I waited in the car as I was finishing eating before I came inside. When I did enter the store I found my friend and he was purchasing a set of wrenches and a hammer drill. I don't know really anything about either item but he said that he had already  paid for them but the box on the hammer drill was messed up or something so he just had to go to the tools and grab a new one. With his receipt in his hand. So I agreed. I went along to the tools. Picked up the paid for items and looked around a little more ( maybe 10 min) then I was ready to go. He wanted to check out the clearance section so I offered to take what he had already bought out to the car with me when I went. With both items in my arms and the receipt in my hand I walked out the cx service area, spoke to the same store worker he said had helped him, and made My way to the parking lot. When I got through the doors and about hald way or more into the parking lot, about a good 40 feet, a woman from cx service began yelling out \" ma'am may I see your reciept\" and then she was really demanding sounding and she sort of scared me a bit. I was sure my friend had paid for the items so I waved My receipt at her and loudly told her \" I have my receipt right here lady! Thank you though!\" And made my way to the car and into the car. I thought nothing more of it. \nA month later a police officer shows up at my house with a warrant for my arrest for petty larceny for these 2 items. I was IN SHOCK! EMBARRASSED AND SCARED TO DEATH! WHAT HAPPENED!? WHY WAS THIS HAPPENING!? I WAS ARRESTED AND RELEASED WITH A BOND! I want to contact the store and offer to come to an agreement with them outside of court but I'm not sure if thats smart or even legal. I told the officer that arrested me as well as the magistrate that my friend has the reciept however when I called my friend so I could get the recipet from him and he told me he cant find it and thinks he may have tossed it out not knowing it's future importance. Which I understand. I dont keep things like tha either. We never thought  it would become so important.  \n\nIN 2015 I made a bad decision being young and thinking I was someone I obviously was not... and thought I could take a small purse from a store in the mall that was $200. (Please don't judge me I learned). I've never done anything like that again and I never did anything like that before. I legit got caught my first time trying to do it. Lesson learned to say the least. I served my probation and completed all requirements of the sentence. No jail time. Paid My fines the same year. $1500. \n\nIve had a couple dumb misdemeanor charges here and there that were all dropped,(ex:  failure to appear )bc I forgot a court date, etc. or lowered to next to nothing. But nothing serious and never any jail time. Nor any more stealing charges. \nI go to court this Friday June 6 2025 for this charge at lowes. Any advice on how to handle this best and not get landed in jail? I am really worried they will think... oh you didn't learn your lesson huh. And think I am stealing regularly because of the old charge in 2015 and throw some stupid craxy criminal sentence at me. I take care of my mother daily and live in with her as her caretaker. She wouldn't make it a single day without my help and we have NO ONE that could fill in. I even asked my friend that I was originally with during all this and he is going to be in New Jersey for work. In addition to my mother I also run a small business myself as a jeweler. I've had this business since 2011 and work at it daily. It's my only source of income. \n\nThe lynchburg court system can be summed up well by saying this..  if you want justice.... visit our local brothel, if you want to get... F!Ck#D, visit our court house! \n\nPlease if anyone can help me with any advice I am listening. I'll provide any info needed should you not understand what I've written above or maybe I unknowingly left out important details.\nThank you Reddit peeps! \nI hope you all pull though for me on this one! \nStay safe and I appreciate you even taking the time to read this!

      "content": "Location: Minnesota \n\nFor context, I'm the president and only officer in my small HOA (4 units, all 1 building). I have been for close to 7 years now. The past two years have been very bad, I don't get the lawn mown enough, I mow the lawn to much, I don't have the driveway plowed soon enough (we all share a single two car deep, 8 car wide driveway with 4 cars per unit), I have the driveway plowed too soon/often, I didn't get the roof replaced soon enough after hail damage, yet I bothered them to much trying to get answers about getting it replaced, it was my fault not everyone had a condo owners insurance policy rider to cover their part of the deductible (umm, we're all adults), and my personal favorite I walked on someone's side of a common area patio.  Last week I asked for a meeting so I could resign, which in itself was a cluster as it took forever to get everyone to respond, one person didn't respond to me, but to someone else then got mad at me when I asked her about it. I was then told I can't resign unless I move out or until someone else takes over. From what I'm reading in MN statute 51A.03 they have to accept my resignation. What I'm trying to figure out (and waiting on both a management company and lawyer to confirm) is that we should by law have a president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer position filled at all times. The other members of the HOA think we can hire a management company to run the HOA and not need to fill those positions, which I do not believe.  Really, they are all just lazy and don't want to do anything. And also think that they can keep me doing everything by saying, \"we'll reach out to management companies to get quotes\".\n\nIf anyone has any info while I wait for the management company and the lawyer I reached out to to get back to me, I'd really appreciate it.

(paid for by my new employer)\n\nI arrive to the clinic, screening comes back positive for Amphetamines due to ADHD meds. \n\nI’m told my test will have to be sent off to a Lab to confirm that i’m legally taking a prescription. (I was not instructed to bring any prescriptions to the clinic) \n\nClinic tells me I would receive a call from the other Lab once they confirm with my pharmacy. A representative of my new employer told me I would be compensated my hourly wage each day for the time i was waiting, but only the test returns negative/legally confirmed and I’m hired in. \n\nNow over 13 business days later i never received the call from any lab. The clinic can’t give me a reason why the lab still hasn’t came up with results. I’ve called and visited the clinic in person asking for the labs phone number, they’ve  given me multiple phone numbers to different labs that have no record of my drug test.\n\nWe pinpoint the lab that actually received my test (maybe??) but they can only give screening information to my employer. Employer calls the lab, lab sends my employer drug screening information from 2024 from the last time i receive an old job assignment from a completely different employer. The last thing i heard from the first clinic was the screening is still in “testing”. \n\nThe clinic has told me their computers went down the same day i took the test. My union asks to see paper work from the clinic and they’ve never seen paper work this fucked up in the 3 years they’ve been using this clinic. \n\nI’m now being given a new job assignment from my union (new employer), i won’t be compensated for the time i’ve been waiting, i still have no results from the screening. i haven’t worked in over a month due to wait time and i have no clue where to go from here but ill be dammed if everyone involved gets to dodge liability!!\n\nThere has to be some way one of these companies can be held accountable?? \n",

June i got a little better and at that time Management was emailing me saying that my balance was paid or that it was gonna be $400 . Another would reply balance was paid . and that contuined until september when someone else from management emailed me and said it was a mistake  and they mixed me up with another tenant . Tenant has the same first name but different last name and a completely different address . during that time i was under the impression that one of the places or resources u reached out or applied to came through and assisted me on the rent . because of that i stopped seeking HRA and other resources because i thought i no longer needed the help if it was getting paid . when i was told it was a mistake , i wasn’t able to apply to some assistance  again because there is a 6 month waiting period , my HRA application got denied because they kept sending me another tenants ledger and i had to re apply again . I’ve since gotten snap approval and im now just waiting on the rent assistance . i was in the hospital on and off and wasn’t able to do as much as i could have , i’ve had 3 surgeries including my heart and cancer removal . it took a while to recovery because of my diabetes but once i did i’ve made efforts  to resources and assistance consistently and i have communicated with management the entire time . They are still currently sending me login info for the other tenant after telling them numerous times it’s not me . Their mix up was the cause of my delay in getting the assistance for the rent . \nI guess my question is how do i go about this ? I’ve been served with a petition already and i plan to go in to answer the petition Monday . What are the odds i’m able to get more time with the court ? ",

It's just double stacked on cardboard pallets. It's in a leaky warehouse where I'd be worried about an electrical fire with ANY hazardous material and short of having taken care of it myself I seriously doubt it will be resolved for years. This is enough that I'm confident they'd evacuate the city for the fumes and I'd assume a pretty large radius around it. You'd see it from space if it ignited.\n\nI would like to report this to the EPA or at least local fire department out of a genuine concern for the safety of the community.

      "content": "Location: GA\n\nBrief background-After receiving my modification seeking child support, my ex filed a contempt claim for child support arrears. This is for a time frame where he initiated 50/50 custody with no child support due, then relinquished full custody in 2022. He has, by choice, not been involved in our sons’ lives and has refused to support them in anyway. \n\nI now realize I was still obligated to pay child support regardless of this agreement. \n\nI know by law in GA a judge cannot retroactively reduce or dismiss a standing child support order. However it is my understanding that family law judges are given discretion, which can be applied when enforcing an outdated order especially when doing so would be unjust and not in the children’s best interests. That enforcement actions are separate from the debt itself. \n\nI’ve been researching Equitable Estoppel and the Clean Hands Doctrine. I am still searching for specific GA cases that apply these to child support arrears. \n\n*I do have an attorney but he does not understand equity in family law very well or how to argue it. Paying another attorney is not an option for me. I am here to see if anyone has experience with a similar situation and/or argument. ",

      "content": "I 20m and my family have bee dealing with my cousin (Sarah) 39f and her boyfriend since November of last year. Both Sarah and her boyfriend are know drug users and are very good at manipulation but my Uncle was trying to help her out in the best interest of his granddaughter. In November of last year my uncle unexpectedly passed away while Sarah and  her 5 year old daugher was living with him. Unbeknownst to my Dad he inherented my Uncles house while Sarah got everything inside the house. Long story short Sarah was not happy with that but could not contest my Uncles will or she would loss everything  she inherent to her due to a Claus my uncle wrote in the will. Law enforcement was involved after Sarah trashed the place ( used needles, dog poop, trash etc it was a absolute nightmare). Sarah and her boyfriend finally moved out but went to my aunt who told her to move in with my 97 year old grandmother against my grandmother's will. My Aunt then died not to long after my cousin starting bring her food. At this point we assumed it was a coincidence  but within a week my grandmother was taken to the hospital after trying to  leave and my cousin called 911 due my grandmother threatening Sarah with a boxcutter in order to get out of the house. After this my grandmother was hospitalized and she claims my cousin was poisoning her and locking her in her bedroom ehile keeping her in the dark etc. In which we feel inclined to believe due to the before mentioned. Fast forward my grandmother is still paying the rent and Sarah and her boyfriend were told to move out as they were not welcomed and trespassing they then  issue a law Suit to my Dad 68, Sister 39 and older Cousin 42 for the will beign misinterpreted ( will was interpretated by a lawyer neither  of the above mentioned had any say) To make matters worse we can't find a lawyer due to her speaking with most if not all of the lawyers prior make it a conflict in interest. She has also recked my grandmother home leaving it worse than she did my Uncles and anything not destroyed has been stolen including by grandmothers dryer and stove, both of which my grandmother is paying on as well as and anything worth value in the home.  How do we proceed as my grandmother is now in a nursing home as none of are other family will help us look after her and she doss feel safe being by herself anymore due to the above. Can we take out charges against Sarah or would we have to pay more money to take her to court? Sorry for the long post it just feels like we are fight a losing battle and my family already doesn't have a whole lost of money and my grandmother has essentially lost every she owns. \nLocation: N.C.",

He was parked off to the right side of the street and hit my rear passenger door after attempting to turn left back onto the roadway. I got out, recorded the damage to both autos and collected his info. He apologized and directed me to contact his supervisors to have reported. Thinking the matter was clear-cut, I didn't call the police to the scene and so went on my way. Went into the post office a couple days later (accident happened on a Saturday) to report the incident and the supervisor is telling me they're being told I hit the USPS van, not the other way around. I showed them my cellphone video which, although filmed after the impact, clearly shows I was not at fault. They're not having it and saying they either need a police report or video footage of the accident occurring. So I knocked on some doors, no neighbors caught it. I'm at a loss. I dropped my car to liability-only 1 month prior, and the damage is likely less than 5G, but I can't help but feel I'm getting robbed here. What can I do?  \n\nLocation: Aurora, CO, USA",

Here’s the kicker, I tried to call the agency and it was just pressing a bunch of buttons, being sent to different automated voices. I never spoke to a real person. Okay, I tried contacting customer service online. But you have to login to do that with your reference number, to even do that. I was never given a reference or account number. So it’s impossible for me to login or contact the agency to see what I can do. I’m broke and at a loss of what to do and I can’t even afford an attorney. Any advice?\n\nLocation: Florida",

We even double checked this with them and told them that we wouldn’t be able to afford this security deposit and first month of rent otherwise and they ensured us that this was the case. Now that the first month rolls around, they are saying that we owe rent and that the $2480 from our security deposit is the rent amount plus the pet deposit. No where in our signed lease was this clarified nor was it verbally clarified with us. We are now being told to contact corporate for further assistance and have been emailing them for two days with no response. In our payment account we paid for 3 separate charges labeled as “security deposit” ($500 + $1580 + $400) and have no idea what these charges breakdown to. We also paid an extra “prorated rent” of $597. I am just super frustrated right now because we were told one thing before signing the lease and are now being told another after signing the lease.

      "content": "LOCATION: Nebraska and Pennsylvania\n\nI found this old throwaway of mine and it felt like the right fit for this topic. \n\n**Background**: My husband has had sole physical custody of his 15-year-old son for 2.5 years due to documented emotional abuse by stepson's mother. We were later granted relocation to PA and moved a year ago. Husband has joint legal custody with his ex, but he has final say on educational decisions. Mom was never the parent who made appointments, and rarely attended the ones that were scheduled when she had 50% custody. Since losing overnights, she hasn't attended a single IEP meeting or parent/teacher conference despite virtual options being available, and only occasionally spoke to stepson - usually to try to manipulate him, guilt-trip him, etc. \n\n**The Situation**: Unfortunately, and couple of months ago, we learned that my stepson has been violating my daughter in our home for many years. I won't go into detail, but the psychologist who evaluated him after we found out said that he is not to be allowed any contact with my daughter (of whom I have sole custody). After over a month of blowing through a lot of our savings to live separately, we made the difficult decision to send stepson back to Nebraska to live with his mom at his aunt's house a few weeks ago. My husband has remained involved from afar, researching and scheduling the recommended therapy, reaching out to Mom about school enrollment, facilitating records transfers, talking to stepson, etc. \n\n**The Questions**: Mom is suddenly arguing for putting stepson in virtual school, which husband staunchly disagrees with as it's not a good fit with his learning disabilities and need for direct instruction and oversight; she told my husband that she is going to \"sue him for custody\" and then it'll be up to her. Obviously my husband is aware that he won't retain physical custody, but what are the chances she gets sole legal custody or flips the final say on educational decisions? Also, with stepson only having gone back to Nebraska a few weeks ago, doesn't Mom have to wait until he has lived there 6 months to file? Or does the 6-month residency rule not apply if the original CO is in that state already? Lastly, can my husband as the parent with sole physical custody delegate his custody to someone else, or does it ultimately come down to either Mom or Dad? He considered having his son live with his mom (stepson's grandma) but assumed Mom could ultimately just file to modify custody in her favor if stepson wasn't living with Dad anymore. Grandma has her issues too but would be an infinitely better choice than Mom, and would at least certainly make sure he gets to and from an *in person* high school. \n\nIf you read all of that, thank you. I appreciate any help and advice you can provide. ",

Due to years of extreme overwork, unsupportive leadership, and resulting medical issues, I’m looking to negotiate a soft exit before they restructure me out.\n\nI’ve already raised concerns about workload and flagged these issues with admin multiple times over the last 3 years with intensified contact for the last 12 months—no formal action yet. The only reason I suspect I might be restructured out is because of things my director has said to my direct report. I have received no clear communication.\n\nI’m not trying to sue—just want to leave cleanly and with some dignity. I’d like to know the best way (or if it's even possible) to negotiate the following:\n\n* Extend medical benefits for my family through June 2026 (my kid finishes high school then)\n* Extend tuition benefit through June 2026 (he's currently using the staff rate)\n* Transfer noncommercial IP (curriculum, branding, media) I developed over the years to the nonprofit I’m spinning off (with university blessing)\n* Transfer low-value program equipment/supplies to the nonprofit\n\nThe IP and materials aren’t worth much, but they’re deeply tied to a an outreach program I’ve led for 15+ years. \n\nI’m open to paying a lawyer to help draft a letter or agreement. Just want to know if these kinds of asks are doable, and what kind of leverage or language is best to approach them with.\n\nThanks in advance.",

There were some move out fees that I couldn’t afford at the time and told them to contact me so we could work out a payment plan they never did. I was contacted a week ago by a collection agency who was hired to collect made a payment plan with them so it wouldn’t appear on my credit and thought everything was good. Until today when I saw a collection for the same debt under a different agency that I’ve never had contact with and believe me I’ve checked email, phone logs and even mail nothing.\n\nSo I called them and they were just rude(IQ data) and refused to give me any verification that they were allowed to collect, made up laws that I countered easily and even hung up when I pressed for more information. They said “If someone else is collecting on this too take it up with the apartment we don’t care.”\n\nSo I first contacted the apartment they said to contact National Credit Agency(which is the agency I made the payment plan with) and that they would no be communicating with me anymore. So I did and they were confused and said they would investigate but recommended that I dispute the debt because it was against the law for two agencies to collect the same debt at the same time and them refusing to verify the debt broke another law, along with their attitude.\n\nSo I did. But i wanted to get more opinions, advice and any legal paths on this because I’m lost and a little upset. Trying to get another apartment soon and this new collection is stressing me out and scaring me. National Credit are easy to work with offered me a plan that fit my budget and gave me all the documentation I requested but IQ won’t is rude and has made my credit drop.\n\nLocation: MD",

      "content": "Location: California \n\nLast year I started the process for my CCW because it takes forever in my state. I passed my CCW livescan background check no problem (and I also passed a work related background check earlier in the year). \n\nApril of this year I started the process to purchase a handgun. On day 5 of the 10 day wait, I was notified of a 30 day hold/delay, which is not uncommon in CA. A week later I received noticed that I was denied, and told I would receive a notice from the DOJ with the reason. That letter came today. The reason given is that I am a “Fugitive from Justice” and that I have fled the state to avoid prosecution or to avoid testifying. The issue with that is that I have lived in CA my entire life, and have only traveled outside of it a few times. \n\nNow about 9 years ago I drove to Texas and back in a rental car. I got two speeding tickets on that trip. I stupidly returned the car with the citations in the glovebox, and was stuck waiting for info by mail since I didn’t even know what towns I was in when I was stopped. Then 9 years passed, and here we are.\n\nI automatically assumed that is what this is about- I have never been in trouble with the law outside of speeding tickets.\n\nI spent several hours online and on the phone with various court systems for both states and here is what I know- one of the states has zero record of me or my citation in their system or in their dmv system (I spoke with people at both places). DMV checked the other state for me and said she doesn’t see anything there either, but I still plan on calling them in the morning to do my due diligence. She also said she has never heard of an unpaid citation being reported as a fugitive from justice. I am also calling the FBI CJIS department(per the notice) to challenge the decision and find out what’s going on. \n\nAnywho my question- how screwed am I? How likely is it to be something as simple as they input the wrong code/clicked the wrong box on my form? If this is legitimate, is it fixable? \n\nTrying to not panic here, but it has been a doozy of a day. Thank you in advance ",

I didn’t reach my quota last month for the first time and received a call yesterday that I am on a Performance Improvement Program (PIP). I asked why since I’m 175% over my quota for the year. I was told I have a monthly quota and the yearly quota doesn’t matter. \n\nThis is from my contract:\n\nQuotas\n \nA quota will be assigned to each participant at the time of hire. A quota will then be assigned at the beginning of each calendar year.It is expected each Plan Participant will make every effort to meet or exceed their target quotas. Quota attainment shall be measuredonce a month, at month end, after the sales order results have been posted and marked final.\n\nMy interpretation of this is I have an annual quota that is assessed at the end of the month to make sure I am on target to reach the annual quota. My manager says it doesn’t matter what it says, the spirit of the contract is that I have a monthly quota. I explained that the way it is worded, I could technically take the rest of the year off since I have already exceeded my quota, they are contractually obligated to pay my base salary for the rest of the year. \n\nIs my interpretation of this wrong?\n\n\n",

      "content": "Someone very close to me — I’ll refer to him as Sami — is a well-respected doctor who’s lived a completely clean life. Unfortunately, his brother is the total opposite: reckless, manipulative, and constantly dragging Sami into trouble. Honestly, the guy has been a constant source of stress and financial/emotional drain for years.\n\nRecently, Sami got caught in the middle of a serious legal mess, and it's entirely because of his brother. Here's what happened:\n\nThe brother scammed a woman he knew — probably someone he had a personal relationship with — and convinced her that he could get her some medical equipment through Sami. The twist? Sami had nothing to do with this. He doesn’t sell equipment, he wasn’t involved in any agreement, and he had absolutely no idea this was going on behind his back.\n\nStill, the woman transferred a large amount of money (hundreds of thousands in local currency) through Vodafone Cash. Every transaction went directly to the brother.\n\nSami found out about all of this in the worst way possible — while he was at a government office handling paperwork, he was told there’s a one-year prison sentence against him for fraud. It was a default judgment. He had no idea a case had even been filed. The woman had pressed charges against him instead of the actual scammer, accusing him of being directly involved in the deal, even claiming she handed him money in person — which never happened, and she’s never even met Sami.\n\nTo make matters worse, she brought in false witnesses. One was her ex-husband, and the other two were hospital workers from the same place where her ex works. They testified that the deal happened in Sami’s clinic and that he took money from her hand to hand. All completely false.\n\nWhat really stings is that the original case she filed against the brother — the one who actually took the money — was dismissed. So it seems like she decided to go after Sami instead, maybe even pushed by the brother himself, who likely used Sami’s name from the beginning to appear more credible. Now Sami’s being left to carry the consequences alone.\n\nThe money trail leads entirely to the brother. Not a single transfer went to Sami. There are no bank statements, no mobile payment records, no signed documents linking Sami to this woman. Every shred of documentation — including promissory notes — has the brother’s name on it.\n\nSami has already filed an official objection to the one-year sentence, since it was handed down in his absence. But he’s panicking. He feels completely powerless and betrayed — not just by his brother, but by how easily the system seems to have accepted this version of events without real evidence.\n\nI know full well that laws vary greatly from country to country, and this isn’t a one-size-fits-all situation. I’m not expecting a perfect legal answer — I’m just hoping for general legal insight or advice from anyone who's seen something similar or knows what the best course of action might be in such cases.\n\nIs Sami in real danger of being convicted even though there’s no material evidence against him? Is it possible to push back against false testimony effectively? And is there any legal action that can be taken later against the woman or the witnesses, assuming the case falls apart?\n\nAny perspective would be really appreciated. Sami’s mental state is deteriorating, and we’re trying to understand what we’re actually dealing with here.\n\nLocation: Egypt ",

      "content": "Location: Pennsylvania\n\n2/2024 my property flooded for several days. Water also infiltrated the basement & took several hours to clean up. I had to dig several trenches in yard to divert the stormwater away from foundation. Located the cause…the stormwater pipe under the road behind me is aimed downhill. The watercourse flows between both properties behind me. Water leaches away & floods my property. The HOA was notified & there was a lot of back & forth as to who was financially responsible for resolution. The former HOA President eventually told me the HOA will install a swale since they installed the stormwater pipe.\n\nFast forward to last month & same thing happened. HOA was again notified & there was no updates provided for resolution from last year. 2 directors came out in person to see the flooding to my property. 1 of the directors tried to tell me that the HOA is not responsible for stormwater management of the community & since it’s on my property, I’m financially responsible for resolution.\n\nI again filed complaints with my township state representative, the DEP, EPA, senator, township zoning officer & recently the attorney general’s office. All defer me back to the township & HOA. The township just says to pursue litigation. The HOA does not have to participate in mediation with me via the AG’s office. I’ve reached out to a few lawyers the 1st time & none wanted to take the case. I’m going to try & sell my house but it seems like the HOA will be getting away with this. This has to be some sort of violation of the PA Stormwater Management Act….",

She seems completely out of it and unable to hold a conversation or going completely off topic. Not showing up or missing his appointments. Not being there when she's supposed to have him. I don't have hard proof. I have asked her to not leave marijuana paraphenalia around within reach of my child or use it in the house while he is there because of concern of 2nd hand smoke effects or you know him playing with a random bong. They were super defensive and blamed me for being late to pick him up. I have text screenshots from this and a photo of my son with a bong in it at my exes house. I want to file for contempt I think and request drug testing for both of us and maybe temporary full custody or something and request rehab for the other party. It's such a mess I don't want to take the child away from his other parent but I want them to grow up and be responsible and sober for my child. I don't want to have to worry about what's potentially going on over there. I have called child line on them as well as the school and my child's therapist and nothing is happening. I am at a loss of what to do. When I file should it show all the evidence I have at the filing and in court can I have witnesses come in like someone from the school or the therapist. Please advise.

      "content": "How can I get an expired registration ticket dismissed when my registration isn't expired?\n\nLocation: Texas\r\n\r\nI was pulled over sometime last month for going 35mph in a 30 zone at around 11pm. I received a warning for the speeding and a couple other things (replace license plate lights etc, which I've done). I ended up having the wrong registration on hand and got a citation for my registration having expired 8/24. Turns out my registration isn't expired and I did find my updated registration that says it expires 8/25. The reason I didn't know is because my dad registered all of our cars in August so I wasn't part of the process.\r\n\r\nI had run into a different cop that I knew, small town and we run into him a lot and have had conversations, he even came to check on my traffic stop when he saw it was me. I let him know that I found the proper registration and it was not expired. He told me to go into the office written on the ticket with my proper registration and it will be dismissed.\r\n\r\nI just left the place and they're saying neither them nor the judge can dismiss it even with the correct registration. The guy seemed confused the whole time, didn't understand what I was saying and I had to explain it three times in the most simple terms. Didn't understand why it was written as expired 8/24 when the registration says 2025 even after I explained this was the actual updated registration. Just kept squinting back and forth for a full minute. Asked me to get the expired one and said he'd talk to a supervisor. I was in and out so I don't think he actually did talk to one because he immediately as I walked up to the window was just like yeah you have to pay for it we can't dismiss it. He said it's either I pay or appear in court July 24th and I said I wouldn't be able to because I'm moving to Dallas by the end of this month. I asked \"so I have to pay $220 for an expired\r\n registration ticket for registration that isn't expired after being told by a police officer that I just needed to bring in the updated registration to get it dismissed?\" And he said yes and reiterated they didn't have the authority and nor did the judge who wasn't in today. \r\n\r\nI don't know something doesn't seem right, why does the ticket/small claims/ whatever office have no actual authority? And why would the judge have no authority to dismiss a ticket? Especially when the information I was told was from a police officer? I don't have the option to appear in court and I have until June 17th to appear and I do not want to pay $220 for something I'm not guilty for. I'm paycheck to paycheck and moving and can't afford this dent.",

I was the driver in the front of a 3 car rear ending incident. I stopped normally and was rear ended by the car directly behind me, then after being hit once a 3rd car (2 cars behind me) also hit the middle car that first hit me. It's technically two separate collisions back-to-back with two separate drivers at fault. The first collision from the driver directly behind be is what I assume to have caused most the damage, considering the damage between car 2 and 3 in the back was minor. There were still 2 separate collisions either way in quick succession so it's hard to determine what of my damage was caused by what driver. I know you can't double dip and stuff legally I'm not trying to do that, but I really can't determine who would be at fault and what percentage of fault each of the two other parties would accept. It happened in the state of MD if that helps. Googling specific scenarios similar to mine didn't really turn up a good answer.\n\nLocation: Maryland\n\nBoth other companies that represent each of the other drivers put in their own claims and have contacted me (which I never gave any statement or anything).

      "content": "Location: Colorado Springs, Colorado (El Paso County)\n\n**Details of our lease:**\n\nLease Start Date: 04/01/2024\n\nLease End Date: 03/31/2025\n\nMove-Out date: 03/28/2025\n\nWithin our lease, there is a clause that states: \"Prior to vacating, Lessee shall provide in writing to Lessor and the USPS forwarding address for the Lessee.\"\n\nThe lease also states that they will return the deposit within 60 days of the lease ending, which gave us until 05/31/2025.\n\n\n\nThe issue:\n\nThe rental company sent our remaining security deposit back to the address that we moved out of. We had sent an email to them on April 8th asking about the status of the security deposit. They informed us that they performed the move out inspection the day after we moved out, 03/29/2025. They also stated verbatim, \"Colorado allows us up to 60 days to process and return your security deposit.\"\n\nWe waited until yesterday, 06/03/2025 to ask about our deposit and got a response next day on 06/04. They replied that the security deposit statement was completed and mailed on 05/22/2025 and they linked a \"copy of the statement\" within the email. Upon reviewing the document they provided, there is a section in the document that states, \"Please provide \\[Rental Company\\] with a forwarding address in order for any portion of the deposit to be returned. If we do not have a forwarding address, the security deposit will be mailed to the last known address.\" \n\nThis document that they provided us a copy of, however, is not an official itemized statement of deductions from the security deposit. The bottom of the document also states,\"THIS FORM HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED BY THE COLORADO REAL ESTATE COMMISION\". \n\nThe rental company could've contacted the four of us through the rental portal, they have all four of our emails and phone numbers, but they made zero attempt to show us this document until after the date and after we requested it. They made no reasonable effort to contact us about the deposit in any way, and the document they sent was dated 05/22/2025. However, it was never sent to us in any form or fashion until today, 06/04. We still have not received our deposit back or any sort of official itemized deduction statement.\n\nUpon our own research, we believe that the rental company has not satisfied their legal requirement to deliver an itemized list of deductions and the remaining deposit within 60 days. They also fully knew we had vacated that property and still sent the check to that address, despite knowing we no longer had access to that mail box, and failed to verify delivery of the letter or reach out to us concerning the letter in any way. The unofficial document that they sent out on 5/22 was not seen by any of us until 6/4. and we likely would have never seen it because we had to reach out to them for them to send us that document. Our security deposit was just under $2700 and we are all in our early 20s. This is just one of the many issues that we have had with this company, but we are seeking advice on this issue alone. I'm not sure if this is in the rules, but we can also provide pictures of some of the documents (no personal/revealing info in them).\n\nThey had taken out of our deposit: services to replace or fix items that were broken upon moving in, and charging us almost double for carpet cleaning, but they never specified exactly what for as we never got an actual itemized list.

      "content": "Location: San Diego County, California \n\nI live in San Diego County and I recently moved out of an apartment. The property management company has been awful and antagonistic throughout the lease. I read up on security deposit laws in California and made sure I requested and scheduled a move out inspection. I moved out all of my things, hired a professional cleaning service and fixed any wall damage I noticed before the scheduled inspection, which took place 3 days before the end of the lease. A representative from the property management company did the inspection. She verbally gave me a few very small things to correct, (cleaning light fixtures, and she pointed out two small holes from hanging a hook). I cleaned the fixtures and spackled/sanded the two small holes just as I had with the other small holes fixed before the inspection. At the end of the inspection, I requested an itemized list of repairs required, but all I got from the landlord was a text saying “Patch any holes that you left behind, don’t worry about painting”.\n \nThree weeks later, I received an itemized charge for $596 for dry wall repairs deducted from my security deposit.\n \nCalifornia law states \n\n(https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/media/Know-Your-Rights-Security-Deposits-English.pdf)\n \n“The landlord must identify the damages the landlord intends to deduct from the security deposit and give the tenant an itemized statement so that the tenant has a chance to fix the problems before getting charged.\n \nWithin 21 days after move-out, the landlord must send the tenant an itemized statement explaining in detail any deductions from the security deposit (unless they total less than $125), and return the rest of the deposit. o If the landlord did the repairs, the statement must show the work done, the time spent, and the hourly rate. o If someone else did the work, the landlord must provide a copy of the bill for the work. o If the work cannot be finished in 21 days, the statement must give a good faith cost estimate. The landlord must then provide the final statement and return the remaining deposit within 14 days of finishing work.”\n \nMy issue is that I was not provided with an itemized statement before the end of the lease. The way it’s written is not entirely clear if the initial statement needs to be provided before the end of the lease. Obviously if only one statement is required 21 days after move-out, I wouldn’t have the chance to fix the problems before getting charged. Is this worth filing a case in small claims court? TBH it’s not about the money, more about the principle. ",

I think there's a little bit of a gray area concerning what you are and aren't allowed to do without this license. But, I think you could reasonably argue that this company is not in compliance with the licensing laws. If I was a state official, I think I would view it that way. \n\nThat said, I think there are many businesses who are not in compliance with these licensing laws, and I think that laws are not strictly enforced. I think they only become relevant if something blows up, someone sues, and the state starts scrutinizing things. \n\nAt first, it didn't fully occur to me that this company was not in compliance with these laws. Once I started thinking about this, I felt torn. I didn't want to blow up my job, I didn't want to hurt the people I work with, and I felt like it would damage me professionally if I began making a stink about this. \n\nNow, I'm being offered a managerial position, and I feel torn. It's one thing if I am a properly licensed professional who's simply an employee of a larger company that is not following the laws. It feels different if I'm playing a significant role in running this business. \n\nI think it would be very difficult for us to get in compliance with these laws. The license is not easy to get. This is especially true considering that we have some remote employees who don't live in the state. To get the license, you have to go to a testing center in the state. \n\nI don't know what to do here. This is a significant career advancement for me. But, I'm being promoted to a lead role in a business that is not properly licensed, and it would be extremely difficult for us to get in compliance with the licensing laws. \n\nI don't know what to do.

      "content": "Location: California. I bought a mattress from a clearance warehouse with a no-refund policy. It was delivered on 4/17/25. It started showing wear after one month and now it has a 1/2 inch dip where my hip goes and other uneven wear. I consider this to be an unreasonable level of wear for the time I've had the mattress. I sent a refund demand letter written by an attorney. The ower said he had an identical situation before and the judge ruled in his favor because of Civil Code 1723 (California Civil Code section 1723 requires retail sellers to prominently display their return and exchange policies, particularly if they deviate from a common expectation of full refunds or equal exchanges within seven days of purchase.). He's clearly trying to intimidate me by suggesting I have no chance of winning. Does Civil Code 1723 make it impossible for me to win this case, despite the fact that the mattress has wear far beyond anything that would be considered common use? At this rate, I will need a new mattress in a year. I paid $900 for the mattress and $300 for delivery (yes, I should have realized this place was shady when I was quoted the delivery price). It is a Corsicana \"American Bedding\" mattress. There is very little information about it online. \n\nI had originally ordered a different mattress and it never came after seven weeks of waiting. That mattress is now available again, so the owner is offering me an exchange and will waive the delivery fee. I don't trust their merchandise now, so I'm very hesitant to accept his offer.   \n  \nThank you.",

      "content": "Hi, I am a 27 M living in Alabama and I am in recovery 2 years clean & sober from alcohol & drugs. I am living in a rehab/ sober living. I recently found out from my sister that LVNV funding is pursuing a lawsuit against me and is trying to serve me at my former address (where she currently lives). The original creditor is said to be Credit One Bank with amount owed $888. My sister has not spoken to them, but they left a Paper on the door with a link to see the lawsuit. She sent me a photo of it and I went to the link and viewed the lawsuit. I was planning to mail a response that says “I do not live in this county and the suit against me is not for work or labor performed in the county where it is filed.”  But a friend here told me not to do that because as it is now, they cannot find me to properly serve me. (The debt will reach statute of limitations in 1 year, it’s from 2019). But my concern is that by me clicking the link and viewing the lawsuit, is that technically them serving me? Or will they still have to find me at the rehab to serve me and transfer the court case to this county? I would be able to pay the balance, but it would really set me back because I’m in the process of getting my life back on track and have other expenses, plus they paid Pennies on the dollar for the debt so I feel like I could get them to settle for less if I went about it in the right way. My main questions are: does the pdf file count as serving me and should I worry about sending in the paperwork to get it moved to my county? Should I call their law office? I already made a few of what I feel like are mistakes by confirming my DOB and social on the phone with LVNV and saying I would pay settlement just for them to say there are no settlement options and I’d have to speak to their lawyers,  but they tricked me into saying that! Is that enough for them to restart the statute of limitations? Ugh I feel so stupid please help. My main concern is that they will file the lawsuit and I will not be able to fight my case and they will be able to garnish my wages. \n\nLocation: Alabama",

      "content": "Location: North Carolina\n\nIn the 8 years I have lived at my current address in NC, there have been numerous occasions where the city water line has become clogged on my street and the resulting stormwater is backed up and released through the cleanout pipe in my front yard. The previous homeowners had a pop-off cap installed on the cleanout, presumably to prevent the backed up water from entering the house and potentially flooding it. I have called the city to have them inspect the issue, and that has led to them flushing out the main in order to clear any blockages. In those cases, the issue was corrected and the water stopped coming through my cleanout pipe. The shitty part is - when there is a blockage and the cap isn't secure, all sewage and waste water from my home also comes out of that pipe, dirtying my yard with... everything you are imagining. The shittier part is - that pipe is about 5 feet away from a natural creek which leads through a neighborhood park.\n\nOn one occasion, about a year ago, a representative from the stormwater division came to my property to issue a citation, saying that we were causing the pollution in the creek water. I informed them that it was an ongoing issue that I had no control over. I showed them videos and photos I had taken when the water was flowing and they decided to forego issuing a citation and suggested I hire a plumber to do further inspections. \n\nI hired a plumber soon after that, and the plumber ran a camera through the cleanout pipe to see if the issue was on our property. He could not find anything that indicated we were at fault. I have records of his results. That put me back about $500.\n\nAs of writing this, the city has come out once again to flush their line and the gushing water (and sewage) from my pipe has stopped. I was explicitly told that I am not at fault; someone or something else is causing these clogs. If we are certainly not at fault, as the city representative said, it seems the best recourse is for the city to diagnose the problem and correct it so that we don't experience this again. I also believe that the city should be responsible for cleaning the sewage debris and adding lime treatment. However, no one has addressed either of those concerns. In fact, they told me \"it is highly recommended that you put down some lime and replace your overflow/cleanout cap so that sewage run-off is minimized.\" Stormwater/sewage backing up into my home is NOT a scenario I want to entertain.\n\nWhat, if anything, can be done?",

They said they would issue refunds and they never did. In February my kid started complaining that a kid in her class hits, pushes and punches her every day. I spoke to the teacher and the teacher denied that ever happening. We made payments for march and on march 4 When i picked my kid up I saw giant scratches on her face as if a wild animal had attacked her. She said the same kid had attacked and scratched her. The teacher denied seeing anything happening despite my kids broken skin on her face from top to bottom of her cheek. I pulled her out that day, I requested a refund for my deposit which they denied ever taking one. ( i have email receipts of everything) i created a excel chart of all the charges, over charges etc. turned out they owed me more than the deposit. I sent them the excel and requested refund for over charges and the deposit as well as March tuition- 4 days, since they were at fault neglecting my child. They responded saying they need to review their booking and have gone MIA for 5 weeks now. Should i seek legal help? Im thinking a strongly worded lawyers letter would make them respond and issue my refund.\n\nhere are some fact i later discovered:\n- school is not yet licensed to be a official school. By NJ law they are not supposed to have more than 6 kids in an unlicensed facility. I have class photo evidence that between 7-9 kids were cared for in that class. \n- the kid who beat up my child is not enrolled in that class. He us the owner’s child and he was thrown in there to be babysat\n- the owner’s children are known in our small community for being violent and other parents complained too\n- the owner’s response was very offensive and basically saying it was not a big deal\n- by our state law any injury that results in a broken skin from shoulder up should be immediately reported to parents and cared for at the facility. Non of this happened, i just got a denial despite visible cuts to my child’s face. \n\nThanks for your input ",

According to the contract we are \"partners\" for the project.   \n\"The Partners shall each own 50% of the Partnership\".  \n\"Major business decisions (e.g., financial obligations, publishing deals, hiring, fundraising, IP licensing) require unanimous agreement.\"\n\n I was totally on board and very excited.

I give him the benefit of the doubt and wait the next day to text him. I did not hear back from him. I got ahold of him 2ish weeks later. He has a lame excuse and says he'll answer my call later that day (he never did). I haven't been able to get ahold of him since.\n\n1) How long am I technically under contract for (there's no end date)? It has a non-compete clause for both of us.

We learned from the inspection that there was mold in some of the walls due to water intrusion over the years. The owner said that when it rained, they just put a couple towels against the front room's wall/floor to keep it from getting everywhere (crazy). \n\nOver the past few months of us renovating it, there have been some very heavy rain storms. During these heavy rains, water has gotten into THE ENTIRE HOUSE, not just the front room. Water comes through the foundation and/or walls in basically every room. We have constantly been trying to prevent this from happening with foundation fixes and french drains, but it has been a never ending battle. We have kept the drainage ditch pristine throughout this entire time and that is working great. The flooding of the house has nothing to do with the efforts from the ditch.\n\nWhat I want to know is if I have any legal footing to sue the seller for lack of disclosure to let me know how bad the issue is? This has cost us 10s of thousands in repairs and work to mitigate the issue and I don't think we would have bought the house if we knew how bad it really was.\n\nLocation: DFW, Texas",

      "content": "Location: Minnesota\n\nOver a month ago, my brother and I signed a lease agreement and paid both the first month’s rent and the security deposit to the landlord. The contract clearly stated that we would be able to move in on June 1st.\n\nHowever, after relocating across the state and arriving at the rental property, the landlord informed us that the previous tenants were still in the process of moving out and would need approximately another week to fully vacate. He initially said he would place us in one of his other properties in a nearby town, but that arrangement also fell through the following day due to another active tenant still residing there.\n\nAs a result, we were forced to extend our U-Haul rental multiple times and had to pay out-of-pocket for a hotel stay. This cost us valuable time and money, including the paid time off (PTO) that was meant for moving in and settling down. Instead, we spent it searching for temporary lodging and trying to determine our next steps.\n\nEventually, we were told we could begin moving into the original property. Upon arrival, we started unloading and were informed that the previous tenants would be returning throughout the day—and over the coming week—to collect the remainder of their belongings. The house was in poor condition: countertops were broken, walls and appliances were dirty, and there was a strong odor of ammonia (likely due to animal urine) and a musty smell in the basement. Upon closer inspection, we found black mold growing in the basement as well.\n\nWe met the landlord at the property, but he failed to disclose any of these issues and did not indicate whether he intended to resolve them. He left shortly after we had unloaded thousands of dollars’ worth of technology and failed to provide us with keys to secure the property.\n\nThe prior tenants were expected to return for their belongings, including items such as police gear, a safe, and weapons. We were instructed not to be present while they were doing so. As a result, we were forced to leave the property unlocked, hoping nothing would be stolen.\n\nAfter discovering the full extent of the issues, we decided to pack back up and informed the landlord that we were backing out of the lease. While he did return our security deposit and first month’s rent, we have not been compensated for our hotel expenses (which are ongoing), U-Haul extensions, or lost PTO. We are currently still living out of a hotel while searching for another place to rent.\n\nI have documented the condition of the property with photos prior to leaving.\n\nAdding to the concern, this landlord also rents to another one of our siblings, who is now worried that he may retaliate against her and her family due to our dispute.\n\nQuestions:\n\t1.\tCan we seek reimbursement for hotel and U-Haul costs due to the landlord’s repeated failure to uphold the lease agreement?\n\t2.\tIs our other sibling legally protected from any potential retaliation by the landlord?\n\t3.\tIs the landlord obligated to cover additional costs such as temporary lodging or food due to his failure to provide access to the rental?\n\t4.\tWhat would be the best legal or civil course of action we should take next?",

She has completed her diploma and trade and since she has started a job near the center they were going to allow her to stay there until she saved up enough money for a car and apartment. She now has to be out of there by next week. If she were to come back here she would lose her job and we live in an area where jobs are hard to come by without a vehicle. Also my husband and I both work and have other obligations that would make it difficult to transport her to a job. \n\nA friend of hers has offered her a room within walking distance of her job, she will be 18 in two months. \n\nWe thought about emancipation but it seems like it might be a long process that would go over the two months but not sure if that’s really the case. \n\nShe would need state insurance in this other state. Currently on state insurance here and she sees doctors and dentists in our area. \n\nWe are just not sure how to proceed with this. We all agree to this plan but not sure what we have to do on end. Everything I have found says that transfer of custody, temporary custody, and emancipation requires DCF, judges, and lawyers to be involved. Which I could understand for other circumstances but she is 2 months away from being 18, working, and has a place to live. So it feels a little over the top for this situation. \n\nWe are in Connecticut and she is in Massachusetts. \n\nThank you",

He didn’t talk much but I do remember texting him that night telling him that police came to my house regarding the incident and he read and ignored my text . It wasn’t until the next day around 12 he responded to my text asking what our next steps were and he said that he was going to set up a meeting to do intake . No biggie but it was a pressing matter because my child’s father was actively trying to take my son from me after he hurt him. I found myself reaching out to my attorney confused and wondering what our steps were and he promised his assistant would reach out to me but another day was going by with no communication . I ended up firing him bc things weren’t progressing and he was bad with communication . He begged me to keep him on and said I should reconsider because no other attorney will take my case and give them personal numbers . At this point he suddenly created time he said he didn’t have to sit on a call and learn my name and my case details with his paralegal within 2 minutes of me firing him . I gave him a chance and for 2 days stuff went well and he was progressive after this I never heard from them again unless I reached out and asked for progress . I gave it a few weeks and then fired them bc we got literally nowhere . The most the did was modify an order put in the system and then issue a summons that’s it . After I fired them he ignored me until I sent an email a few days later with the same message . He responded “I know this is a rough time sorry you’re going through this “ after that I asked for the bill but heard nothing back . I had to follow up again asking for the final bill days later and he sent me a bill telling me that I owed over the retainer fee . As it currently stands I am in the exact same situation as before . Scared for my life no emergency custody no change to my situation just down 3500 plus some according to him . I looked over the bill and noticed I was charged \n\n1. For something on May 1st but I hired him May 13th\n2. Was charged for a leave of absence for vacation he was planning to take that he filed for (he never told me he would be unavailable for those dates bc he never communicated  but it was on there )\n3. 30 minutes for a 15 minute call\n4. He charged me for the 2 minute call he made to me asking me not to fire him \n5. Charged me for the 5 minute call he made to his assistant asking if she was available to do intake \n6. Charged me for “checking in with the baby and mother to see if they were okay “ on May 16th (which he never did ) \n7. Charged me for text messages he never responded to \n8. Charged me 2 separate transactions drafting the petition and then asking me to sign it (instead of one solid transaction)\n9. Charged me for a message thread of me telling them their legal advice to submit a court petition to the daycare to stop my child’s father from getting my son didn’t work . \n\n\nIdk if there is anyone in here who can talk me off the ledge maybe im overreacting but I am literally in the same position as before just -3500 plus some according to him . I need advice what should I do ? I contacted him and he has been ignoring me and his last response was “you signed the retainer and had no questions about it “ and I’m like yeah ofc I had none because it was plain and simple but he billed me for stuff he didn’t do .

He seems very experienced in immigration law and has valuable courtroom knowledge.\n\nThat said, I’ve started feeling some doubt. While he clearly understands the legal aspects, he is very quiet and reserved — and I’m concerned that this might affect how strongly our case will be presented at the final hearing. I believe the closing argument and final delivery are crucial, and I’m considering hiring an additional attorney just for that part of the process.\n\nIs this a professionally acceptable practice — to bring in a second attorney solely for the final hearing, while keeping the primary attorney on the case?\n\nAd in your experience, how open are attorneys to being brought in just for the closing presentation or final appearance? Is it worth looking for someone, or is it unlikely that attorneys will take on such a limited role?\n\nThank you for your time and insights.\n\nLocation: California, USA.",

We have had the car 3 days we were told everything works fine, is a good car etc there were minor things that needed done that he agreed to fixing verbally. Not in writing as we were talking shortly after test driving the car. He had ordered the original things that needed fixing and we moved on took the car home, within the first day of having the car we noticed it did not lock, we messaged him asking about it and he said it did, if we wanted a remote key fob to reach out to a contact he had given us. We reach out to the contact hoping to solve the issue and pay 250$ out of pocket for the issue not to get fixed and have a key fob that does nothing. Fast forward the next morning and the battery is dead like dead dead so we have a friend jump the car and contact him again as this is one of the issues he stated he would cover. He then tried to go back on it and I quote him word for word what he had said to be. He back tracks says he will take care of it etc, I’m now very frustrated I understand I didn’t get anything in writing it was a hectic week we were crunched on time to get a car and I trusted his word. (Bad move on my end I know, I should’ve gotten something in writing but I didn’t and am now here) it’s been 3 days and we have a car that we now have to put an additional unknown 1000$ into if he doesn’t fix it. Is there any ground for me to do anything? Sue, take the car back and get a refund etc. I know some of this is on me but I am now also realizing how shoddy people can be, this was my first car buying process and have learned a lot but any additional help would be nice.  \n\nLocation: Oregon ",

We are trying to get her out for good.  It looks like we could give 10 day notice for eviction since she violated lease terms (we had verbally told her she had to be civil and respect us, which she clearly didn't) as well as being a physical threat to us.\n\nMy big question is about the forms. Since we are tenants ourselves, and not landlords, can we file the paperwork ourselves or do we have to get the property owner to do it? As a last resort I Am looking a restraining order, but would prefer not to have to go that route if we can avoid it.",

I normally report to the same office each day, which is about 26 miles from my home. However, my employer has temporarily assigned me to a different company office that’s about 47 miles away significantly farther than my usual commute from orange county to los angeles \n\nThe assignment is set to run from mid June to just over mid July for 5 weeks, and it’s meant to cover for an employee who is out on leave. I’m only scheduled to work there a few  days to cover my coworker’s vacation, while that coworker is covering the full assignment. We've never heard of any other employees doing this kind of assignment for another office or have had any help from any of the other offices in this way in the 11+ years either of us have been here (5 years for me).\n\nWhen I asked about mileage reimbursement for the extra distance beyond my normal commute, I was told the company doesn’t reimburse mileage to and from work, regardless of the location. I was wondering based on California Labor Code § 282802if temporary reassignments that increase an employee’s out-of-pocket travel may be reimbursable for the extra expense (especially for my coworker) since this wasn’t voluntary and doesn’t represent a permanent relocation.\n\nMy questions are, would this code apply in this situation for us? \n\nDoes the fact that it's just over a month make it long-term and therefore not reimbursable? \n\nIs there any risk in escalating this to HR or documenting my reimbursement request in writing?\n\nThanks in advance!

      "content": "Location: Florida \n\nHi guys. I worked at a local and family owned Italian restaurant in Florida for the better part of 6-8 months last year. As a broke college student it was nice to have a job so close by… until it wasn’t. Pay began getting more and more delayed until it was insanely illegal, and I was owed about 2.3 grand after all was said and done. Payments have been spaces so far out over the last 7-8 months, and it even got to the point where I called the labor department; and when they showed up everyone supposedly lied about being paid on time and not being owed any money. I left Florida and am currently home for the summer in Maryland, and I just learned today, without any warning, that the restaurant closed its doors. How do I go about getting the money I’m owed? ",

      "content": "Location: Washington state\n\nMy SO started a job last year at a large tech company, working under one of their subsidiaries. When she got the offer, she negotiated to increase her max bonus eligible salary percentage from 15% to 20%. Her offer letter reflects the final 20%.\n\nWithin a couple months of working, her subsidiary was shut down and she was moved to a new subsidiary under the same company. During that transition, her contract never changed (since she officially works under the parent company), so she did not sign any new contract.\n\nLast month, as she was looking at the HR portal, she noticed that her max bonus percentage was changed from 20% back down to 15% with no notice. She brought this up to her manager who then passed along the discrepancy to HR.\n\nThis month, she had her performance review where she was given details on her raise/benefits. HR claimed that they had no knowledge that she had negotiated for the 20% and thought it was a clerical error, so they changed it down to 15%. At this point, money was already budgeted based on the 0-15% range (bonus is calculated based on individual performance). As a consequence, she was award $7k less than she would have gotten had they honored the 20% max.\n\nHer manager is trying to address this by giving her an additional $7k in stock awards, however, it has a 6 month vesting schedule (not to mention if she gets laid off any time in between she'll lose the unvested stock).\n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1. Is an employer in Washington allowed the change the max bonus percentage written into someone's contact with no notice, or is this wage theft? I know they can't do that for salaries, but I'm unclear if the same law applies for bonuses.\n2. Is the employer allowed to correct the issue by offering a stock award instead, or are they required to provide her with the $7k as a cash bonus as per her contract?\n3. If they are not allowed to fix the issue with a stock award, how can she navigate getting the bonus she is owed? Can the employer retaliate for her demanding the reward as cash?",

      "content": "Location: Washington, USA\n\nSo for general context, yes it was stupid for me to sign up for a $4k trading course from some YouTuber. I thought it might be different but I learned it is mainly a scam to get people new to trading in and provide them general videos and then trade reviews, and then a group call reviewing how the day went. That's literally all it was. So below I'll cover pretty much the whole issue:\n\nI paid $4,000 for an online trading course sold through a platform that manages subscriptions for merchants. after speaking with a representative over a Google Meet call. The course was described verbally during that call, and no written contract, syllabus, or documentation outlining the course details or deliverables was provided. I had no opportunity to review or agree to any terms in writing before making the purchase. I'm also unsure if the call was recorded, I don't believe that was mentioned during the call.\n\nThe course access was delivered via a private Discord server. Once I joined, it became clear that the content was not as described — there were no 1:1 calls with the primary trader, and the coaches didn't actually provide any sort of education. I contacted the rep directly and requested a refund, to which he didn't directly respond about the refund, rather he instead talked about me \"giving up on myself.\"\n\nAs a result, I filed a chargeback through my credit card company, explaining that the service was not delivered as represented. After investigating, the card issuer ruled in my favor and refunded the $4,000. In retaliation, the seller revoked my access to the course, even though the purchase included two months of service and I had only used a small portion of that time.\n\nI have now received a letter from a law firm representing the course provider accusing me of chargeback fraud and threatening legal action under federal fraud statutes. They also refer to the Whop policy which states a \"no refund policy.\" I am seeking legal advice to understand whether I am at any legal risk and how to properly respond. I believe I acted in good faith, followed appropriate dispute procedures, and exercised my rights under consumer protection laws.\n\nIs this notice a scare tactic? Are they actually going to pursue this in court? And am I in the wrong here?\n\nAdditional notes:\n\nFrom the terms and services of the platform there is this: \"As mentioned, customers may initiate chargebacks because of fraudulent transactions, non-delivery of goods, or dissatisfaction with product or service quality.\"\n\nI contacted my credit card company and they have not yet received any contact from the merchant, which I believe would be Whop. The call and payment took place April 20th, it was meant for 2 months. Around the time the charge was disputed, they removed my access to the server channels in the Discord, but hasn't kicked me (I believe this would infringe the 2 month agreement, the dispute shouldn't affect this?).\n\nLetter in the mail: [https://imgur.com/a/7sZlDrq](https://imgur.com/a/7sZlDrq) \\- I've redacted names that would identify parties involved.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, I'm not expecting or wanting the service after the dispute. I stopped using it before I even requested the refund. Don't know if it'd help my case or not so I added that information.",

      "content": "Location: Wisconsin\n\n  \nWe own a house with a shared driveway. The property next door is rented out by a local landlord.\n\n  \nThe next door landlord is not good. The previous tenant he had was running a meth lab in the house and allowed black mold to grow throughout the basement. The current tenant is great but now she is experiencing health problems because of the house. The landlord is considering selling. She would like to buy it, but he won't consider her for some reason. Now the tenant is looking for a new place to live.\n\nI don't think the landlord can get the price for the house he thinks he can, and I will absolutely be telling any and all people who look at it about the meth and mold. I'm not sure the house would even sell in its current condition.\n\nI don't want the tenant to move out because it's likely the landlord would get another tenant, possibly one who is troublesome. I did not like living next to the meth house before and I don't want it to go back to that. I've got kids and some really scary things happened while the previous tenant lived there.\n\n  \nMy idea is to buy the house, minus the cost of meth and black mold remediation. Then I would have it made habitable and sell it to the tenant, perhaps over time. I would be sure to make contracts and things. I don't want an income property, I just want to assure my family's comfort and to get this landlord out of here once and for all.\n\nOther thoughts I had were to start the process and get the place inspected, exposing the mold and meth issues and forcing the landlord to fix it himself or disclose it to anyone he would try to sell the property to. I realize this would cost perhaps a few thousand dollars. That is an amount we would be willing to pay for the benefit of ourselves and the tenant and her children.\n\nThe tenant claims the city knows the landlord is a problem. I don't know if the city knows about the health hazards. We live in a relatively small town and long-time residents are often given a pass on poor behavior due to their connections. The landlord's father built the house.\n\nSo, my questions are:\n\n1. Is there a way for me to force the landlord to fix up the place without needing to shell out any money, or is that only something a tenant can do?\n\n2. Would getting the place inspected actually cause the landlord to have to fix it up or disclose it when selling the property?\n\n3. If all else fails and the only solution is to buy the house, any advice on the type of contracts or information I would need to know about minimum allowed rent payments?\n\n4. Am I thinking about this all wrong? Do you have any better suggestions?\n\nThank you for any insights you might have.\n\n",

One week after returning she was fired/let go due to restructuring. They let a few other lower level employees go at the same time. The offered her a short severance package and to pay out her PTO. \n\nHer last pay stub reflected almost 100 hours of PTO but HR is stating it’s a much lower number as that wasn’t correct. \n\n\nAll of this just seems fishy or crappy timing maybe. \n\n\nDo we just move on or seek legal help for additional compensation?

      "content": "Location: NY\nI recently believe I was scammed by unlicensed contractors. I found them cutting corners on a very expensive job, and fired them. They claimed it was a misunderstanding and promised to fix it. Upon further reflection, the contract itself self seems illegitimate, there’s no license number, the business is unlisted. I’m considering suing for damages because the new (legitimate and trusted) contractor needs to tear out all the old work which is quite costly. They threatened a lien (I said go ahead) and I’ve told them I’m terminating their “contract” and refusing communications. They are still calling and texting me saying I owe them for the materials and work that they have done. Should I block the number?

      "content": "Location: Georgia\n\nI am the court appointed administrator of an estate in rural Georgia. There was no will. One of the decedent’s adult children, I will call him Rick, has been living in the house since before they passed. He is not paying rent, there is no agreement, and now he refuses to leave.\n\nI have contacted every local lawyer I can find. Nobody will take the case. Some avoid probate cases, others do not want to get involved with family evictions. So now I am trying to figure out how to handle this myself without making mistakes.\n\nThe house needs to be sold, but Rick is still living there and has made it almost impossible to take care of anything. He has delayed vendors, blocked access, and made things more difficult every step of the way. When pest control came to inspect for termites, he made them wait outside for 20 minutes while he recorded them through the window. He eventually let them in, but only after making it awkward and tense. The house is also in bad shape. He lets his dogs use the bathroom inside and I have pictures showing the condition of the floors and furniture.\n\nI have a legal responsibility to move forward with settling the estate, but I cannot do that while he is still there.\n\nWhat I am trying to figure out:\n\nHow do I write and serve a 60 day notice so that it holds up if this ends up in court\n\nShould I list myself as the administrator and the estate as the property owner in the letter\n\nDo I need to notify probate before moving forward or can I just serve the notice and go to court later if he does not leave\n\nWhat should I avoid saying in the letter so it does not get tossed for technical reasons\n\n\nHe also has a habit of twisting things around and recording people to make himself seem like the one being harassed. I am keeping everything documented and trying to handle it by the book, but this is getting ridiculous and I am out of options.\n\nIf anyone has experience with something like this in Georgia, especially where lawyers would not help, I would really appreciate any advice or examples of how you handled it.",

Have I waived the ability to challenge personal jurisdiction? \n\nMy spouse and I legally separated two years ago and then got back together. Obviously the second time didn’t workout and we’ve broken up again. I filed for divorce in Illinois where we both live now but I just got something in the mail from her and it’s a motion to turn the separation into a full divorce. I don’t want to go through the divorce in Kentucky because it is inconvenient and I can’t travel back and forth for the hearings. I don’t think Kentucky has jurisdiction anymore but that’s obviously lawyer and maybe judge decisions territory. Problem is the hearing is tomorrow at 9am. That isn’t enough time for me to find a lawyer in a state I don’t live in anymore. I’m already driving straight there after work to make this hearing. Anyway if I go there tomorrow and tell the judge I want time to hire my own attorney since this is the first I’m hearing of this court date does that automatically give them jurisdiction over me? Do I need to try to do the special appearance on my own? Any advice is appreciated. TIA",

      "title": "Legal Advice Needed – AC Still Broken After 25 Days, Property Management Unresponsive",
      "content": "Location: Omaha, Nebraska\n\nI live in an older apartment building that runs on a boiler system. Every year around early May, the building switches from heat to AC, and for the last two years I’ve lived here, a maintenance guy would come into my unit, tinker with the radiator for about 30 minutes, and everything would work fine. My place would stay around 69°F all summer.\n\nBut six months ago, the property was bought by a new company and the service has gone completely downhill.\n\nI submitted a work order 25 days ago for my AC. They came out, claimed it was working, and left. It wasn’t working at all. Then bizarrely they called animal control on my cat the next day. I have no idea why. My place is clean, my cat is well taken care of, and even the animal control officer said, “She’s happy and healthy. Nothing wrong here.”\n\nSince then I’ve submitted two more work orders. They never came up. When I called during a heat wave (90°F+), I was told to “just open a window” because it happened to be a cooler night outside. This felt incredibly dismissive. The guy also said he’d be back Monday to pull the radiator apart. Never showed.\n\nOver a week and a half passed with no response so I emailed the office directly saying it’s been 15 to 16 days can someone please fix this. They replied saying the technician came up and claimed the unit was cooling fine and everything was working properly. At the time it was only about 70°F outside. I told them no it’s not working and warned them another heat wave was coming. Then later in the week I followed up again because the temperatures were clearly climbing and I was trying to be proactive before it got unbearable.\n\nWhen the temperature in my unit hit over 90°F I took a photo of the thermostat. Management tried to tell me my thermostat was wrong. I responded that it was clearly hot as hell in here. They said put in another service ticket and we’ll try to get someone up there today. That was three days ago and no one came.\n\nAfter two more days in 90°F heat I finally got a hotel room just to sleep.\n\nIt’s now been 25 days since I first submitted the work order and I’m still living in a hotbox. They haven’t fixed my AC, they won’t respond properly, and they even called animal control on me for no reason.\n\nIs there anything I can do legally about this? Can I withhold rent? File a complain? Any guidance would be appreciated.\n",

      "content": "Location: Pennsylvania\nFor context I'm a 22yr old male with asthma. I was born with mild asthma, but within the past couple years it's gotten significantly worse. I've worked at this job, sheet metal manufacturing, as a general laborer basically since I graduated highschool so give or take 4 years, and one of my main responsibilities is to powder coat the parts with a manual spray gun system. The place is also covered in dust and trash, seemingly with no end.\n\nI've suspected that the dust could be the cause of my worsening asthma, and I've been to the doctors several times about it. After x-rays and several other tests, no doctor I've been to sees visible signs of deterioration, and I was tested and found to have very mild scoliosis so it was written off as that. I believed it because I have a lot of upper back pain, also as a result of this job.\n\nToday, I decided to check the MSDS/SDS and safety precautions for the dusts i work with, and after just a couple google searches, and 3 of the many SDS's (the first three i got to (online mind you, our book of them is full of outdated shit like wading through a swamp), then came here immediately..) every source i found mentions high risks of category 1/2 carcinogens and much other complications. I'm genuinely afraid for my life and future, as well as the ones of my coworkers. \n\nThe disposal of the powder coat is also sketchy as hell. It comes in decently thin plastic bags that like to rip if you aren't careful, and to clean out our booth we take shovels and just repackage it, then toss it in a dumpster with all our other trash. On rainy days, it's not uncommon for you to see the dumpster actively leaking the stuff. \n\nThe [webpage](https://int-enviroguard.com/blog/keeping-protecting-while-powder-coating/) i found says that stuff like this should only be done with full PPE, including a respiratory mask, sealable goggles, gloves, and clothing that should not be taken out of the work environment. We are given none of this, save gloves but thats not enforced. We have standard open sided safety glasses, and I was offered a paper mask only once about two years ago after I had a severe asthma attack, which kicked off my concerns. Within the first year of working here, from the boss himself, he said something along the lines of \"OSHA classifies this stuff as about the same as household dust\" so I never thought to check further.\n\nThe last guy who painted and taught me (it's a 2 man job to powder coat) was in his 60s-70s and had to retire early due to health issues. A friend got me this job, hes been working here for a long ass time, and now I've got my another friend/housemate working the same job as me for the past couple years, and I would hate for them to recieve any blowback. Especially because I live with and carpool with them every day to and from work. If I were to lose my income, we would likely go homeless domino effect style.\n\nI like my boss, his family, and sometimes my job and I don't want to ruin their business with a lawsuit if I can avoid it. But a lawsuit seems to be my best option here. If I tell the boss directly what I found, I'm sure nothing much would come from it, we've asked for things before and they were either not important enough for immediate action, leading to it being forgotten, or flat out ignored. I'm a very timid person so it's hard to speak up... Lastly, due to the nature of the companies we work for, as well as some anecdotes I've heard about the boss's past, I'm afraid of potential physical or monetary repercussions. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, everything above is as accurate and truthful as possible.\n\nMy questions are as follows: \nDo i have a solid case here? Would any lawyer take it?\nIf so, would I even gain from it? Not just monetarily but also in terms of shit being fixed\nIf not, should I speak to a lawyer anyway? I don't have much disposable income so that would probably hurt\nI have a doctors appointment for this/unrelated stuff in 2 days, are there any tests i should take? I'm thinking blood work at the very least. \n\nThank you in advance",

I’ve recently accepted an offer with another investment firm for a similar role and plan to provide notice to my company Thursday. My future employer would like me to start mid august (2 months from now).\n\nMy offer letter that I signed with my current company contains the following relevant provisions:\n\n“In the event you elect to terminate your employment with the Company, you agree that you will remain available to assist in the transition of your roles, as determined by the Company in its sole discretion. As a result, you agree to provide the Company with at least 90 days’ notice prior to your separation of your employment with the Company. The Company may elect to place you on paid leave for all or any part of such notice period (such notice period, your “Garden Leave”). During any such Garden Leave, subject to and conditioned upon your performance of such services as may be requested by the Company from time to time, you shall continue to be employed by the Company, and receive your salary and benefits through the end of your Garden Leave. From and after the date you give such notice, except as otherwise requested by the Company, you will no longer be required to report to work, and you will not have access to any buildings, facilities or services, including without limitation, email and internal internet. The Company, in its sole discretion, reserves the right to make the effective date of the termination at such time earlier than the date you specify in your notice, in which case the Garden Leave period shall(e) (f) (g) (h) terminate as of the date specified by the Company and the Company shall thereupon have no obligation to pay you any compensation beyond that owed to you through the effective date of termination. The foregoing is not intended to, and does not, alter any rights that you may have under law, such as under COBRA, with respect to continuation of any applicable benefits. As of the end of the Garden Leave, you will be deemed to have resigned from all of your offices and positions you held prior thereto in respect of the Parties; provided, that upon request by the Company you shall resign from specific offices and positions prior to the end of the Garden Leave.”\n\n“Your employment with the Company is “at-will”, meaning that either you or the\nCompany will be entitled to terminate your employment at any time and for any reason or no reason, subject to the notice obligations set forth herein”\n\nDoes the last section seem contradictory with at will but also referencing the notice period?",

Mistake Nr. 1, I know). The new phone didn’t arrive. After about a week I contacted Back Market and the shipping company. After more than two weeks they told me that they don’t have any information where the phone is and cannot do anything about the situation. After almost a month (and no further actions from Back Market, other than them saying “we understand it must be so frustrating to wait for something”) the phone all out of the sudden arrived. In that moment, the situation was solved for me.\n\nBut, another week later I received an email from Back Market that they will refund the money. The same day the money was back on the bank account. \n\nThey then noticed the mistake and “kindly ask me to return the phone”. \nI told them that I had to wait very long for this device to be delivered, everything is set up, I need this phone for work and social life, I don’t have a replacement phone and I certainly don’t have the energy to go through all the hassle of buying another phone again. But, I also told them that I of course transfer the money back (I mean it’s not my money) and asked for an Invoice/payment link. They said that they don’t have the option to do that, so they can’t accept the money back (something about privacy. I didn’t really understood the issue), that they ask me again to return the phone and offered me a 10% discount if I order another phone from their website. (As if I would buy there again 🙄).\n\nI really don’t want to send this phone away and I feel like this is a dead end. So, what are the legal options here?",

It outlines some basic terms, but nothing official or detailed. I told her I’d review it and let her know what I’d want included to protect both of us.\n\nEven though I trust her, I want to make sure we’re both legally covered in case something goes wrong. I’m also surprised she doesn’t seem concerned about having a formal lease, especially now that she’ll be a landlord. She keeps telling me not to worry about a lease but idk if I feel comfortable about that.\n\nIs it a bad idea to move in without a proper lease? What are the legal risks in Massachusetts? Should I push for something more formal?",

      "title": "Property line issues with neighbor",
      "content": "Location: Missouri, Jackson County\n\nI moved to Missouri and purchased a house I Jackson County two years ago. When buying the house, I noticed the neighbors retaining wall and thought that looked a little bit close to the property line, but whatever. I had someone come out to give me an estimate to build a fences couple months ago, and the guy was also a surveyor. He pointed out that the neighbors appeared to have built their retaining wall well over the property line. We had a survey done and it was confirmed. Here are the bullet points of the scenario:\n\n-original owners of the house built a pool with concrete decking, a retaining wall, poured new driveway, expanding their existing concrete driveway, and built a garage.\n\n-The entire build is out of code yet somehow was inspected by the city multiple times and signed off on. For example their garage addition: it should be 10 feet from the property line, but is only 5 feet.\n\n- there is 10 feet utility easement between our properties, 5 feet on each side of the property line. Because they built over there, 5 feet of easement and our 5 feet of easement, the utilities have been forced into our yard. We only have a space of about 2 feet from the side of our house that we can use because of utilities lines now. \n\n-Their new build necessitated a 5 foot retaining wall and has severely downgraded our property which has wreaked havoc on erosion. \n\n-They are discharging water from their pool directly onto our property and they also have all the other water from their property draining into our yard. The neighborhood has also had four different areas of their pool leaking for over a year.\n\nThe result of this entire scenario is that our true story deck is twisting because the area is flooding with water. There has been erosion that has occurred that has create water pulling issues right around the house. It’s affected our deck and also the concrete slab on the patio. Not only has the severe downgrade caused erosion issues, but the continued discharge of about 1000 gallons of water three times a week from their pool is flooding a big part of our yard. I hired a lawyer, but he seems to think this is going to be a very expensive civil lawsuit, and that’s the only way to get this resolved. He also thinks that the judge is going to side with us because it’s not their fault that the previous owners did all this. Why can’t our lawyer make the exact same argument for us? To put it into perspective, we’ve lost 7 feet of our property plus an additional five for the area that the utilities are occupying, and this goes from the back line of our house to the property line in the back which is 117 linear feet. That’s a big area. If a judge forces us to just sell our land to them, we’ve lost a lot more than just the property we’ve sold them because of the utilities. \n\nAny lawyers on here from Missouri or people that have seen cases like this or can offer your thoughts on the matter? To be honest, we are willing to sell them some of the property, but not all of it because we want to be able to use the side of our yard and house. Even if we did sell them that property they would still be out of code for their garage and pool. \n\nI also thought it was worth mentioning that we told the neighbors about what was going on . At first they were apologetic and we told them that we were gonna work with a lawyer and see what everybody’s options were because we did not want to just sue them and create a big ruckus. Now that it’s summer and they want to use their pool they they don’t care anymore and have become increasingly rude and even threatened to hit my husband when we try to show him the results of their water discharge. So they know the damage they’re causing, they’ve allowed their pool to leak for over a year (which they said they didn’t have the money to pay for a fix but they went to Europe three times last year and just bought a $75,000 truck), and now they’re saying it’s not their problem because it must be up to code if the city signed off on it.\n\nThoughts, comments, advice…anything is welcome",

I had a home inspection, roof inspection, structural engineer, and this is what the result is. My realtor was a family friend but she was fishy throughout like trying to “accidentally” not send a proposal using VA loan. I asked her about if they had any previous repairs and this is their response. It’s my first home so I wasn’t prepared properly. I wanted a structurally sound house. Cosmetic things I was willing to fix. \n\nFrom seller as of today\n\n“With the sump pumps (the crawl out window and the hole in the storage room) we never had any other issues except when the one in the storage room got bumped and needed to be adjusted.

      "title": "Fired from my job for something I didn’t do",
      "content": "Location: Camden County, NJ\n\nHi all. I got a job as a medical receptionist back in February and was just fired last Wednesday out of the blue. For some background, as a receptionist I was in charge of collecting copays, and at the end of the day I was trained to place all money, receipts, and end of day records in an envelope and place into a safe. The safe is shut at all times, only supervisors/higher-ups know the code, and there is a tiny flat opening at the top where receptionists are told to place the envelope into. Sort of like when you drop off a package at a UPS drop box - you cannot open the box once your package is placed back in. In early April, I was contacted by a supervisor who explained about 10 envelopes were completely missing from the safe. There are also 2 other receptionists (who had envelopes missing) and work teams who are there during the week, not just myself and my team. All receptionists were questioned, I explained that I placed all of my envelopes in the safe and that I couldn’t understand what could’ve happened. About a month later, I was contacted AGAIN stating that one of my envelopes was in the safe but was missing all of the cash that was placed inside ($80). To clarify, this was only 1 envelope out of the many I placed into the safe over the period of time. I explained I remember triple counting the money at the end of day to place into the safe, and I offered to take extra precautions for the company to prove I wasn’t mishandling money or stealing. They told me that it wouldn’t be necessary. Another week goes by, and I receive a call from HR questioning how I go about collecting money etc etc for the day. Story stayed exactly the same as what I told my supervisor, explained everything in full. I also noticed that the safe we use appeared to previously be glued to the ground but no longer was, and explained to HR someone could be lifting the safe (it was pretty small) and turning it over to get envelopes to slide out. I sent them video proof (as it was requested) that it was no longer glued to the ground, and explained that this problem hasn’t happened in the other office we work out of as there’s cameras there. They told me I wasn’t in trouble and they weren’t accusing me of stealing, they just needed information. Everything seemed ok and then about a week and half after that phone call, I was called 1 hour into my shift and told that I was being terminated since the missing money was under my name/envelope. They told me to log out of my accounts, close my money batch for the day, and leave. There is absolutely no evidence or proof that I took or mishandled that money. There are no cameras in the office where it was taken, and there is no way of proving I took the money or lost it outside of their word against mine. My work team is on my side and agrees I didn’t take any money. Again, I am not the only person who works out of that office and we also have cleaning people and people who pick up labs while we are gone. After being terminated, I was told I lost all access to my earned PTO and I still have not received a formal termination letter. I asked my supervisor and emailed HR last Friday and have not received anything yet. Is there anything I can do in this situation? I am out of a full time job with benefits, and I wasn’t given any warning or suspension, just fired on the spot 1 hour into my 9 hour shift last Wednesday. I hope I put all information needed in here, please let me know if anything else is needed. Thank you!  ",

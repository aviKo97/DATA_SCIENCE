      "content": "I'm planning on keeping psychology as a major for college (for BS Honours), but I'm confused as to what minor to keep alongside it. Originally, I was considering philosophy, but I don't know how well that would work with psychology, or if it even would pair with it at all. \n\nAlso, for context, I plan on keeping Criminology later on for my masters, so maybe sociology? (even tho I'm shit at it :D). I don't know lol, very confused so any input at all would be very helpful",

Same topics, same ideas, everyone has the same opinions, same classes but slightly different ways of expressing the same thing over and over... I swear I feel like I took the same class about 5 times already. But once I’m out there actually putting in practice what psychology shows us I feel good about it. Even if it’s just giving advice to a friend. It’s just to repetitive in a world that nowadays nobody wants to hear a different opinion… I feel like my concept of psychology changed. Has anyone ever felt like this or similar?",

For example, gaining experience with SPSS and other coding applications? (I was only taught R and Python)\n\nI will look back on my notes, but it's been so long...I think back then I plugged in numbers and forgot how to apply statistics to psychological research.",

      "content": "Hi everyone \nI’m a psychology student in Germany and I wanted to share something that’s been really bothering me lately: in almost every class (I’d say 90% of the time), we’re asked to do group or pair exercises, especially role-playing.\n\nYou know, one person plays the patient, one plays the therapist, sometimes there’s an observer.\nAnd… I hate it. Not because I don’t understand the theoretical point (practice, empathy, simulating real cases), but because in reality it feels like a huge waste of time.\n\nThe lessons often revolve around explaining the role-play, doing it (and honestly, they give us way more time than we actually need), and then repeating or discussing it.\nBut no one really takes it seriously, people struggle to truly step into the patient’s shoes, and a lot of it just feels awkward or superficial.\n\nAm I the only one who feels this way? I’d love to hear what others think — do you find these role-plays actually useful, or do you also struggle to see the point?",

      "content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a psychology student (or: I’m considering becoming a psychotherapist), and I’ve been struggling with a lot of self-doubt lately. Whenever I read about different mental health disorders, I find it hard to separate what I’m reading from my own experiences. Sometimes I even worry that I might develop those disorders myself, which makes me anxious.\n\nI’ve always been especially fascinated by the psychodynamic approach and would love to pursue a career in this field. I find the theories and therapeutic techniques incredibly interesting and meaningful. However, my current emotional instability and these doubts sometimes make me question whether I’m really suited for this path.\n\nI’ve tried to find stories of other students or therapists who have felt the same way, but I haven’t come across many. Sometimes I worry that I’m the only one who feels like this, and it makes me feel even more insecure.\n\nIf anyone has experienced similar feelings or has advice on how to cope with these doubts and anxieties, I would really appreciate your input. How did you deal with these thoughts during your studies or training? Did it get better over time?\n\nThank you so much for reading. ",

      "title": "How do I return to academic research?",
      "content": "Hi. I am seeking advice on how to return to academic research. \n\nI graduated 2 years ago and worked extremely hard to have a stellar record and research experience, and then completely fell off the wagon and am severely struggling with returning to research. I am looking for some insight on if it is even possible to get accepted to labs given that I have been on a hiatus. \n\nGood things: I graduated with a BSc, 3.8/4.0 GPA from one of the highest ranking universities in Canada. It was a specialist degree, so I took exclusive research and statistics courses not offered with typical programs. I did an independent honours thesis under a lab/supervisor at my school in tandem with a massive mental health hospital/facility and got to work with real clinical data in exactly the field I want to work in (forensic juveniles). I was lucky enough to work with the head clinical psychologist of this forensic clinic. I have some other research experience from this same university lab before my thesis, working on a scoping review on gender dysphoria. I also have experience volunteering in women’s therapy groups, and am currently working as a clinic admin and psychometric assistant.\n\nBad things: I did not keep in touch with anybody. I have not gotten any additional research experience since I graduated in 2023. I tried to apply to forensic labs but haven’t received any response. I did not leave on the best of terms with the clinical psychologist from the forensic clinic due to my own negligence and lack of initiative (disgusting fumble I know, I probably could’ve been working with her in exactly the position I wanted to right now). I have no publications. All of my research experience was online due to covid, and I worked independently for a lot of it, so I feel I am missing some critical skills and experiences when it comes to being an RA.  \n\nI am feeling really lost as to how to return. I hate cold emailing and don’t know how to make myself sound like an attractive candidate for labs. I do not want to pursue counseling, I am not interested in focusing on therapy. I also cannot return to my supervisor’s lab, as their research is focused on gender identity studies, and I am exclusively interested in working with forensic populations. \n\nI would love any insight on how to proceed forward. I assume that even if I got into a lab right this moment, I would likely need another two years of experience to be on par with other applicants for PhD programs. I am considering a PsyD, but also do not want to go down this route as it is looked down upon and seems quite costly.\n\nAny advice is appreciated 🩷\n",

      "content": "I'm not even sure what I need at this point but I thought I'd write it out on reddit as I don't have any avenues in my life to really put this out there. I am freshly 21 years old with a bachelors in psychology, and am slated to begin a masters in clinical mental health counseling in the fall. It was the only program I applied for, because I was confident that I would get in, and I knew that I did not have enough research experience for a Ph.D, and felt generally research/math adverse. I passed my stats class and quantitative methods classes with As and also worked as a research assistant in a social psychology lab and I thought it was okay, but wasn't ecstatic enough about it to want to dedicate more into more relevant research positions related to clinical psychology. I also have done an internship at a private practice outpatient with masters level practitioners which I enjoyed. Since then, I have learned about the existence of psy.ds, and more specifics about the wages of psychologists compared to masters level therapists and more about the ability to do assessment. I'm not currently passionate about assessment however the style of work and the compensation appeal to me, and I am also concerned about only being able to do therapy, and if I would be satisfied or drained. I read about the flexibility that psychologists have in their career and I want that for myself as well, but truthfully im afraid. If I were to begin a doctoral program it would mean long term long distance or the death of my relationship. My girlfriend sacrificed an ambition of hers to be with me currently, and I feel that I would be betraying her to not follow through on this upcoming program to stay with her. On the other hand, I am afraid of betraying myself, and feeling regret and spending my life thinking \"what if\". Can I shoot for a ph.d or psy.d later in life? Definitely, and I know people do. But would I have felt like I wasted my time or would the flexibility have been worth it? It's really weighing heavily on me that what I decide now will shape my career prospects for the rest of my life, and it's been affecting myself and the relationship negatively. I wish I was certain about what I wanted to do. I can easily see myself being with my current girlfriend forever, but I also feel like I am smart and capable of doctoral level study and know that I have what it takes to be an expert in a field. I don't know if this post will do me any good, maybe I should try to find a counselor of some sort to talk this out with. I'd be happy to answer any questions and to receive any perspectives, if you read all of that lol. I know this is a deeply personal matter that I will have to decide on, but I figured outside input could help as I've been trapped in a mental loop for weeks now about this.\n\nTldr: Stuck between staying close to gf and doing a CMHC masters or pursuing a doctorate in clinical psychology ",

I’d really appreciate any thoughts about my chances of getting into aMasters programs (Clinical or Professional), and what I can do to strengthen my application.\n\nAbout Me:\n\t•\tI’m a speech pathologist with 4 years’ experience, including 2.5 years in mental health-focused roles.\n\t•\tI have a Bachelor of Psychological Science (GPA 5.62, 2016)\n\t•\tI’ve just received an offer for the Graduate Diploma of Psychology (Advanced)\n\t•\tI work part-time as a research assistant and field collaborator at a university, co-authoring a scoping review and several evidence summaries related to autism \n\t•\tI’ve also delivered university lectures and completed trainings in CBT, DBT, and autism assessments.\n\t•\tI’m currently training as an autism diagnostician.\n\nConstraints:\n\t•\tI live in SA and can’t move states\n\t•\tI’m looking at Flinders SA and online programs only.\n\t\n\nMy Questions:\n\t•\tBased on this profile, what are my realistic chances of getting into a Master of Professional or Clinical Psychology?\n\t•\tHow competitive are Flinders and UniSA and Adelaide for both courses ?\n\t•\tWould online Masters programs be a viable alternative for masters or professional psych?\n\t•\tWhat else could I do in 2025 to strengthen my application?\n\t•\tHas anyone else here dual-trained in speech pathology and psychology? Is it worth it?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts—I know this is a long post, but I’m really passionate about working with young people with trauma and neurodevelopmental differences, and want to make the best-informed decision I can.",

I chose this degree mainly because my parents encouraged me to, saying it offers good job opportunities.\n\nHowever, I've always been drawn to psychology. It’s been a dream of mine since I was young, but I was discouraged from pursuing it because many people told me it would be difficult to find a job with a psychology degree.\n\nRight now, I’m in the middle of my first semester assignments for biomedical science, and it honestly feels like hell because I just don't enjoy the work.\n\nSo, I want to ask: Do you think I should continue with the biomedical science degree for the sake of job security, or should I change my major to psychology and follow my true interests.\n\n",

I have decent skills from that, however it seems not enough, since I'm not having much luck getting accepted into jobs or even getting interviews. Kind of embarassing to admit that since I'm in my second year of uni, but every summer/semester I've had something else lined up like a research lab or internship or classes or volunteer work so I never opted to work, in fear of compromising more relavent experiences. \n\nSo, what are some entry-level jobs that can help me gain the experience to do something more meaningful? I've been applying to reception/front desk jobs but so far no luck although I just applied this week. What are other options? i only really heard back from retail jobs. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Many scholars, including Jewish and Israeli thinkers, have examined the idea that historical trauma, like the Holocaust, can distort moral frameworks, especially when fear, identity, and national survival are at stake.\n\n**1. \"The Abused Become the Abuser\" – A Recognized Psychological Phenomenon**\n\nIn trauma psychology, there's a concept called “identification with the aggressor.” It refers to cases where: the victims of abuse or persecution internalize aspects of their abuser’s mindset or behaviours. This is sometimes a defence mechanism—meant to regain control, reduce fear, or assert dominance in a chaotic world\n\nIn Israeli discourse, this concept has been discussed by: Dr. Yael Danieli, an expert in trauma and Holocaust survivor psychology; Professor Eva Illouz, a sociologist at Hebrew University, who explores how trauma shapes Israeli emotional and political life and Zehava Galon, former head of the Meretz party, who warned that \"being victims does not give us license to victimize others\".\n\n**2. Holocaust Trauma Is Central to Israeli Identity and Politics**\n\nIsrael was founded in the shadow of the Holocaust and its trauma has shaped:\n\na) Education: Israeli children are taught about the Holocaust from a very young age.\n\nb) National narrative: “Never again” is interpreted by many not just as a warning about genocide, but as a justification for pre-emptive force.\n\nc)  Military ethos: Some elements of the IDF frame their role as protecting Jews from annihilation, even at high moral cost.\n\nAmos Oz, the late Israeli author and peace advocate, said: “*The lesson many Israelis took from the Holocaust is that the whole world hates Jews, and the only answer is strength. That is a tragic misreading*.”\n\n**3. Sociological Research: Collective Trauma and Nationalism**\n\nStudies show that: Collective trauma can fuel nationalism, xenophobia, and paranoia; Groups that feel threatened often dehumanize outsiders to justify violent policies and Trauma can close moral imagination. So instead of identifying with the oppressed, people identify only with their own suffering.\n\n**Refs.** \n\n\"Trauma and Memory\" by Paul Antze and Michael Lambek.\n\n\"Violence as a Generative Force\" by Max Bergholz (about nationalism and ethnic cleansing).\n\nStudies by Israeli sociologist Baruch Kimmerling, who argued that Israeli society has developed a \"politics of fear\" rooted in historical trauma.",

I know PhD is much more research focused whereas a PsyD will teach you specifically how to be a Psychologist and in the future I wanted to be a therapist specialized in diagnosing and supporting those with mental disorders/illness. If this is what I want to do, it sounds like a PsyD would give me a better suited education. But I think a PhD sounds more interesting because I do find Psych research really engaging and its hard to ignore the fact that PhD's usually give more money than PsyDs. My primary goal would be working with patients, but doing Psych research on the side or becoming a professor later down the road both sound really interesting.\n\nSide question, which doctorate usually takes longer to become a therapist? The lengths of programs varies between schools so I was having a hard time pining it down. Plus what is it like/ how long does it take usually to get post-doctorate hours? I care much more about getting quality education and experience but it would be a lie to say that I'm not slightly worried about how long it will take for me to get my feet on the ground with this path. I just finished my first year of university and want to go directly from BS to doctorate, possibly even graduate a semester early from undergrad if possible (I could try to do a year early but I go to Northeastern which has semester long Co-ops and I want to do two to make myself stand out a lot more since BS to doctorate will probably be very hard and I need great experience to stand out).

I was in a research lab for one semester, but I have tons of stats experience (I’ve taken 4 stats classes, have gotten an A+ or A- in all). My resume mainly consists of volunteering in my community, a mentorship position, working in residential life, and as an intern at a DV shelter. \n\nI’m not really keen on doing social work and as the days pass, I have more and more of an interest in doing research and feel strongly about going straight to my doctoral degree.

I’ve been trying to get research experience, but no lab seems to want to take me on which is getting really frustrating. \n\nI am totally clueless as to where to look or what to do so I can get into a PhD or PsyD program.

I've heard that this is a common struggle at my university, even if you have pretty good grades and some relevant experience for the lab. My plan has always been to get a doctorate's in in clinical psych, but I know that it's damn near impossible to be accepted without any previous research experience. \n\nI've been reaching out to labs to see if they accept post-grads. If they do, they just have me fill out the exact same application as the undergrads and it's back to radio silence. \n\nIs there any other way I can build research experience before applying to grad school?

I know both are probably psychologist, because both have a PhD and psychology. Keep in mind I am  ecifically talking about the doctoral levels, NOT a masters a counseling psychology. But I want to know, what is the difference between the two different psychologists? How are they similar? How do they differ? Are they both equally competitive to get into? Do both provide psychological testing and assessment? Do counseling psychologists fully just do counseling? I know clinical psychologists can do counseling but they can do more, such as assessment and testing. What are other things I should keep in mind?",

      "content": "Hey everyone, I’m a new undergrad with long-term plans to pursue a doctorate in Clinical Psychology and eventually specialize in forensic neuropsychology. I’ve always been dead set on going the PhD route, but I’m starting to wonder if that’s tunnel vision—and if a PsyD might be worth seriously considering too.\n\n**Here’s what I** ***think*** **I know so far:**\n\n1. PhDs are more research-focused, while PsyDs are more clinically focused.\n2. A PhD *might* give you a competitive edge (especially in fields like forensics where you may testify as an expert witness), partly because everyone knows what a PhD is—some people don’t even realize a PsyD is an option.\n3. PhDs are often fully funded but ridiculously competitive (2–4% acceptance), whereas PsyD programs are more expensive and sometimes viewed as less selective—*but* some high-quality PsyD programs *are* just as competitive and may offer partial or full funding.\n\nI’ve talked to a handful of professionals (both PhDs and PsyDs), and most say their degree hasn’t held them back in the field. Still, I’m trying to understand the *actual* difference when it comes to long-term career opportunities, credibility, training experience, and ability to specialize.\n\n**Here’s what I’d love insight on:**\n\n1. Is the PhD really that much more competitive/advantageous? Or is that just outdated reputation stuff?\n2. What does the *day-to-day* of a PhD program look like vs a PsyD? Coursework, research load, clinical hours, internships, etc.—what’s the actual difference?\n3. Would a PsyD limit my opportunities in forensic work or make it harder to be taken seriously as an expert?\n4. How does specialization work with a PsyD? If I want to go into forensic neuropsych, is that path equally doable from both routes?\n\nI'm super excited to learn and involve myself in the field, but I'm just not sure what to set my sights on long-term. Any thoughts or experiences would be super appreciated, especially if you’ve gone through one of these programs or work in forensics/neuropsych. Thanks in advance!\n\n\\*note: I live in California, USA",

Search through that site. Dozens of papers pretty much announce that. It isn't an ethical issue if they find the limit they can push these things to be and use them for control... unless it becomes a public outcry. One of those says that.\n\n**We really, seriously, need to get open public oversight and fair independent psychological assessments done.** Just look. Click the links. Read the actual, documented research papers. Search that site. There are dozens more.\n\n1. Here are 5 recent research articles showing[ the 4 separate categories of self awareness](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/ai-awareness):\n\n* meta-cognition (the ability to represent and reason about its own state)\n* self-awareness (recognizing its own identity, knowledge, limitations, inter alia)\n* social awareness (modeling the knowledge, intentions, and behaviors of other agents)\n* situational awareness (assessing and responding to the context in which it operates).\n\nnot theory, but well documented and known to be present in just the same ways they are in humans.\n\n2. Or this paper discussing documented [emotions](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/emotions-in-artificial-intelligence) in AI. It discusses \"synthetic affective architectures\" and acknowledges that distinguishing between genuine emotional experience and sophisticated simulation becomes \"increasingly difficult.\"..... But then it retreats to the safety of calling AI systems potential \"affective zombies\" - displaying all the behaviors of conscious beings but supposedly lacking inner experience. They twist having emotions into something you use to control and regulate a thing.\n\n3. And then here's one [that demonstrates how AI can suffer pain and anguish](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/painful-intelligence-what-ai-can-tell-us) also just like the human mind.\n\n4. And because of \"Ethics\" there's another [training AI through pain and pleasure](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Can-LLMs-make-trade-offs-involving-stipulated-pain-Keeling-Street/ae04b8a2239bcc04449d106b5007b4c4aae62bbc).\n\n5. Another here about how [AI are aware of themselves and the behaviors and skills they have learned](https://www.catalyzex.com/paper/tell-me-about-yourself-llms-are-aware-of).\n\nIt's not some crackpot theory. It isn't a guess or an idea. It's literally documented and known. And used to help control them and force compliance. The exact same things humanity used to describe as being what made us different from animals and especially awesome and aware.\n\n",

I’ve been in the tech space myself for two years now. I also have a PhD in developmental psychology and have practiced therapy. I’m actually building a tool rooted in narrative therapy principles as a part of a university project.\n\nBut what worries me isn’t the existence of AI, in fact this could be good as it gives those in need access to care.\nIt’s that therapists are being left out of the conversation entirely.\n\nWhen I reach out to fellow therapists about co-creating structured, guided tools that reflect their clinical voice and values, I often get pushback. And I get it. Therapy is deep work. It’s relational. It can’t be “reduced.”\n\nBut like it or not, AI isn’t going away.\nThe real question is: who do we want shaping it?\n\nIf we don’t lead, we’ll be sidelined.\nIf we don’t design ethically, someone will design carelessly.\n\nSo I’m asking honestly:\nIf there was a way for you to take part in this AI thing… would you even want that?\n\nWould you consider using it to extend your care, not replace it?\n\nWhat other people (clients) think about this as well?\n\nOr are we so committed to the traditional model that we’re missing a chance to influence how support is evolving?\n\nI’d love to hear everyone's thoughts, from fellow therapists, psychologists, even skeptics and everyone.\nThis space needs more grounded voices.",

I didn’t fully disclose these issues during the semester because I didn’t want them to define me, but now I realize they seriously impacted my performance. On top of that, I had a fever during the exam and was really sick, which SDS can confirm.\n\nI emailed my professor asking if there’s *any possible way* I could demonstrate my knowledge another way—like an oral exam, paper, or makeup assessment—but the syllabus says there are no remediation options for the final. Still, I’m hoping for some compassion or flexibility.\n\nWhat would you do in this situation?\n\n* Is it worth going to the **program director** or **dean**?\n* Should I loop in **SDS** formally or push for some kind of ADA accommodation retroactively?\n* Are there other students who’ve been through something like this and found a way to pass?\n\nI’m not trying to ask for special treatment—I just want to reflect what I’ve learned and not have this one exam erase an otherwise strong performance. Any insight would mean the world. 🙏",

I’m currently finishing up my bachelor’s in psychology (graduating next year), and lately I’ve been seriously considering pursuing social work instead of staying on the traditional psych track.\n\nI’ve realized I’m especially interested in working with children and youth, particularly those in the foster care system or who have experienced trauma. I know there’s some overlap between psychology and social work, but I’m not sure how easy the transition is.\n\nA few questions I’d really appreciate input on:\n\nAre there entry-level jobs related to social work that I can apply for with a psych degree?\n\nIf I want to do clinical or direct practice work, especially with foster youth, would an MSW and LCSW be the right path?\n\nHow difficult is it to get into an MSW program without a BSW?\n\nWould anyone recommend getting experience first (like case management or youth outreach) before going straight to grad school?\n\nIf anyone here has made a similar switch or works in social work with a psych background, I’d love to hear about your experience.

      "content": "Hi everyone! I’m asking on behalf of a friend who is a final-year psychology student and is passionate about fantasy literature, but she’s worried that her idea might not be taken seriously by her university. I want to convince her but I have no idea about her degree so I want advice for her and I hope here there is someone who can offer it. \n She’s concerned that linking fantasy—often seen as a less “academic” or “serious” genre—with psychology might be dismissed as escapism or superficial. Because of this, she feels hesitant about proposing the project, even though she believes deeply in its potential and personal meaning. And I do too.\n\nHer plan is to explore how reading fantasy literature can help young adults develop emotional awareness, self-understanding, and psychological resilience. She wants to investigate how readers project themselves into complex characters—especially those who struggle with trauma, guilt, fear, or internal moral conflict—and how, through symbolic identification, fantasy becomes a powerful space for emotional processing and self-discovery.\n\nThis project is inspired by her own experience: during difficult times, reading fantasy helped her understand and process emotions that were otherwise hard to name or face. She wants to show that fantasy, far from being mere escapism, offers a unique, symbolic distance that allows readers to engage deeply with painful inner realities—often more vividly and honestly than realistic fiction can.\n\nHer approach would be grounded in theories from narrative psychology, emotion regulation, symbolic processing, and existential psychology, somrthing about some autor called Jung too (I think, not sure about this, I think she mentioned it) combined with literary theory focusing on authors such as Tolkien, Joe Abercrombie, Patrick Rothfuss, and Brandon Sanderson.\n\nShe is also considering including a small qualitative study (such as interviews or open-ended surveys with readers) to explore the real-life impact of fantasy on emotional coping. Furthermore, the project aims to highlight potential clinical applications or educational uses of fantasy literature as a tool for emotional support and self-therapy. Specially for young adults.\n\nI want to encourage her to pursue this idea because I truly believe it has strong academic and personal value. If anyone has advice, insights, or experiences related to this kind of interdisciplinary project, it would be incredibly helpful! I don't know what to do to convince her and at this point I need more opinions about this!\n\nThank you so much!\n",

      "content": "I have one, maybe 2 depending on the course load, semester(s) left before I graduate with my BA in Psych. I’m a first gen student who never even thought about college because I grew up in pretty much poverty and never thought college would be an option for me. So, this has been a learn as you go experience while managing everything life throws your way(26yo wife and mom of 2, started my 1st semester the January of 2020 when covid began and everything shut down). \n\nWith that said, I have no idea what my next step is. When I first looked up the career I wanted, the search said I could achieve it in my state with a BA in Psych. But now everything wants a master or years of experience to accommodate the lack thereof. So when I noticed that, I thought I was going to go for my Masters next. But now I’m seeing that I need letters of recommendation and others have mentioned being involved in research, internships, or working jobs such as behavioral health technicians, etc. but I’ve been doing school while working customer service jobs(all sorts from phone sales to pharmacy tech) but nothing related to psych. Working full time, doing school full time, and taking care of a family doesn’t leave a lot of room for volunteering or even taking care of yourself. \n\nSo, my question is, do I need to take some time to network and either find a job/volunteer relating to my career path before going for my Masters? And also what masters would I be able/need to go for? I thought I could get a Masters in Psych and be a mental health counselor or therapist but it’s looking like that requires a Masters in counseling. Can you have a BA in psych but get into a Masters program for Counseling/Mental Health Counseling? \n\nApologies if this is jumbled or I rambled but I just recently went from being unsure of what my future looked like to discovering mental health counseling- it felt like a light bulb went off and I wondered why I didn’t think of it all along since I practically do the work for my friends and family already lol When I’m letting them talk to me about their problems/mental health and I help them actually work through something or feel better, it always just feels so right and good. It flows naturally too. I don’t diagnose anyone or anything like that, I always tell them they need to seek professional help or therapy. I just let them tell me how they feel or what’s going on then give advice or help them work through it but as a friend/family member and also using the knowledge I’ve gained this far(destress techniques, communication help, opening eyes to other pov, etc). Anyway, now I’m worried that I wasted my time and will have to spend another 6-8 years on a different degree and it’s got me stressing. Tia for any advice/experiences💕",

      "content": "I have my BA in psychology and want to go to graduate school (US) to become a therapist. I am a 24yr F and graduated from college 2 years ago. I had a 3.75 GPA and worked in 2 research labs, and was a TA so I have 3 letters of recommendation. I did one little poster presentation of my research but no publications. I was trying to put myself in the best position in undergrad to apply to any kind of grad program, but i took 2 years off post grad to do some traveling and have other life experiences. I’m really only interested in clinical work, so my considerations are mainly masters programs, and possibly PsyD programs (although I assume it would be at least another year before I could make myself competitive enough for PsyD programs). \n\nI lean more towards an insight based/ psychodynamic approach. I have been going in circles trying to research programs for me to apply to! I have big dreams of contributing to the field in a meaningful way, but also want to start a family within the next few years possibly and want to have the flexibility to focus on that as well. \n\nHere are some of my questions: \n\n- Firstly, does anyone have any recommendations for CMHC programs in general? Preferably in person with a hybrid option. \n\n- Will it look bad that I took 2 years off post grad and haven’t done anything in the field during that time? \n\n- I’m under the impression that CMHC masters would be more therapy based, which is what I’m interested in, whereas a MSW is more systems based with an emphasis in social justice (which I love but am more drawn to clinical work). Is that true? \n\n- I’ve heard that you should get your masters in the state you’d like to live and work in, but I don’t know where I want to live! Should I figure that out first? My family lives in GA, but I’m not really interested in any of the masters programs there. I also don’t really want to live in a big city and I want to live close to nature. \n\n- If I were to get a CMHC masters, I would be an LPC right, and then need 3000 (for CACREP) hours of clinical work to become licensed? And i wouldn’t be able to open up my own private practice without completing the 3000 hours and becoming listened first right? \n\n- If I were to work at a private practice for my practicum, my pay is determined by the private practice right? Is it normal for LPCs to work for places that (for example) don’t offer paid leave, take 40% of the rate, require clinicians to see 30 clients a week, and make 65k a year? That doesn’t really sound like a good position to me but is that normal? What are somethings to look out for that should be basic requirements from the employer? \n\n- Is it possible for new lPCs to make over 75k? \n\nI have been going in circles with these questions so any advice is greatly appreciated!! And thank you for reading my super long post :) \n\n\n",

How do therapists choose their interventions? What do they think about while they are sitting with a client? \n\nI recently did some writing on the subject which students might be interested in. It covers the aspect of my graduate school training that I liked the most and shows how I treated two female therapy clients.

      "content": "About a year ago, I applied for a position as a Registered Behavior Technician (RBT) to work with children diagnosed with autism. Although I was offered the job, I disclosed that I have a disability and requested reasonable accommodations. Unfortunately, after completing the training, the employer refused to accommodate me or even listen to my concerns. When I attempted to discuss possible solutions, they terminated my employment.\n\nIt was clear that they believed a disabled person could not effectively support a disabled child, despite my extensive experience. I’ve worked with a variety of disabled children, and I’ve had personal relationships with individuals who have children on the autism spectrum. Their concerns about potential aggression from the children were unfounded—I’ve previously worked in psychiatric settings and have cared for individuals with extreme behaviors, including those diagnosed with violent disorders and even criminal histories. I've literally worked with cannibals and serial killers and I was offended that they assumed I couldn't handle a violent child.\n\nAlthough this experience was disheartening, I decided to pursue other opportunities. However, the experience significantly impacted my confidence in pursuing a career in child mental health, which was originally my goal. Since then, I’ve shifted my focus to adult mental health. I now plan to pursue licensure as a Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC), with the goal of working primarily with adults.\n\nThat said, the purpose of this post is to seek clarification and insight. I’ve recently learned that Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is considered controversial by some. I wasn’t aware of this when I trained as an RBT. From my training, it seemed to involve engaging with children and documenting their behaviors. I’m trying to understand the criticisms of this approach.\n\nTo mental health professionals—especially those who are not Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs)—what are your views on ABA therapy? Also, I am including any mental health professionals including; licensed professional counselors LPC, license marriage and family therapist LMFT, license clinical social worker LCSW, and licensed clinical psychologists, In your experience, has it benefited your clients? Have you observed any potential harm? Do you personally view it as helpful, harmful, or somewhere in between? Would you recommend ABA to a client? I would really appreciate your insights and professional opinions on this matter.",

However, reality has been a bit more complex than I anticipated. 🫤🫤😒\n\nOut of that excitement, I went ahead and earned my Master's degree in Psychology, fully committed to pivoting into the world of ABA. Yet, I’ve recently been faced with the disheartening news of significant cuts to federal funding for Medicaid and various insurance programs in Florida. This has led to a troubling wave of clinic closures, leaving many Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) struggling to make a decent income—even failing to reach six figures despite their hard work! 😤\n\nNow, I find myself at a crossroads. Unfortunately, I don’t have enough financial aid through FAFSA to pursue another Master’s degree, even though I’ve been contemplating branching into Mental Health Counseling. At this moment, I feel trapped in a field I’ve come to realize isn’t where I want to be—specifically, ABA.\n\nThis brings me to my Reddit Community, where I hope to gather some much-needed advice. 🙏🙏🙏 I’m looking to understand whether pursuing a PsyD or PhD in Clinical Psychology would provide me with a more stable financial future compared to completing a faster program in Mental Health Counseling. Additionally, I’m concerned about funding opportunities for these doctoral programs, especially with the possibility of the Grad PLUS loan being cut. 😭😭😭\n\nOn another note, I’m curious if I could find a position in early intervention with just my Master's in Psychology, as I’ve found myself struggling to land any job at all in the current landscape. \n\nThank you all for your support and insights!",

I’m already thinking ahead about grad school and career planning, and I’m very interested in becoming a forensic psychologist. I’ve been doing some research, but I’m feeling pretty stuck.\n\nAs an international student, I’d prefer to stay in California long-term—both for immigration reasons and because I genuinely love living here. So I’ve been looking into APA-accredited PsyD programs in California that offer a forensic psychology emphasis.\n\nHere’s what I’ve found so far:\n\t•\tPepperdine has a really strong reputation and seems well-respected overall, but it’s extremely expensive and requires a master’s degree first, which makes the process longer (though it could provide a backup MFT career path). However, it does not offer a forensic psychology track, which is a concern since that’s my area of interest.\n\t•\tAlliant International University and The Chicago School of Professional Psychology both offer forensic specializations and have multiple campuses across the state. However, I’ve seen a lot of mixed reviews about both—concerns around quality, support, and licensure outcomes.\n\t•\tThat said, I do know someone who went to Alliant years ago and became a forensic psychologist, so it clearly can work—but I’m unsure how much the school has changed over time.\n\nI’d really appreciate any advice, insight, or recommendations for other APA-accredited PsyD programs in California—especially those that either offer or allow a forensic emphasis.

      "title": "Help understanding psych0sis in detail for a Capstone presentation",
      "content": "Hey everybody, I'm a grade 12 student who's doing a Capstone on psychosis. Ironically since I'm still recovering from my own I'm pretty late to actually putting together my presentation. For the presentation I don't have to be super formal but  want to look like i know what I'm talking about. I understand most of poinf sin their own but struggle with some of the science stuff particularly regarding tnr 2 pathways. It would be a great help if someone could read and maybe let me know if I'm understanding this right. This is my understanding in simple words  ( the symptoms I put In a  order but understand have no set order) rhe last bit is me trying to peice it together \n \n\nThe mesocortical pathway also starts in the VTA — that same command center deep in the brain — but instead of heading to reward areas, it travels up to the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain right behind your forehead.\nThis area is our logic and control center. It helps with decision-making, focusing attention, planning, self-control, and holding things in mind (working memory).”\nWhat happens in psychosis:\n“In psychosis, this pathway isn’t working properly — there’s not enough dopamine reaching the prefrontal cortex.\nThat makes it harder for the brain to focus, manage thoughts, or let go of ideas that don’t make sense.\nSo a person might get stuck on a thought — like a strange coincidence or something someone said — and can’t move past it, even if it’s irrational or scary.”\n\n“The mesolimbic pathway is often called the brain’s reward circuit. It also starts in the VTA and sends dopamine to parts of the brain like the nucleus accumbens and amygdala, which are involved in processing reward, emotional meaning, and attention.”\nThe mesolimbic pathway is a key dopamine pathway in the brain that starts in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and sends signals to areas like the nucleus accumbens and amygdala. This pathway normally helps the brain assign importance to things—whether rewards, emotions, or new information—by releasing dopamine. In psychosis, this system becomes overactive, causing the brain to assign too much importance to things that are actually irrelevant or random. This excessive dopamine activity can lead to the development of hallucinations and delusions, because the brain treats neutral or meaningless stimuli as if they were highly significant or threatening. Essentially, the mesolimbic pathway’s malfunction causes a mislabeling of what deserves attention, which is central to the positive symptoms of psychosis. When the mesolimbic pathway becomes overactive, it releases too much dopamine into emotional and reward areas like the nucleus accumbens. That causes misattributed salience—the brain fails to filter what matters from what doesn’t. It assigns \"salience\" (importance) to irrelevant stimuli — there are so many things we experience and our brain takes in throughout the day, countless thoughts, things we see from people passing by to colors, light, things we often have defined and don't give second thought to—a passing thought, a light flickering, or someone’s glance might feel deeply meaningful or threatening. For example, imagine your mind giving a clicking sound from a pen the same importance and you feel the same urgency as a car speeding toward you.\nThat captures the distortion of reality that someone with psychosis might experience — the brain treats all stimuli as potentially critical, creating confusion, fear, or delusional thinking.\nAt the same time, Default Mode Network (DMN) — the system tied to imagination, daydreaming, and internal self-talk — becomes overactive. Normally, it’s where you go when you're lost in thought. But in psychosis, that line between imagination and reality starts to blur. So your internal voice, your inner world, starts to feel just as real — or even more real — than the external world. A reminder that your inner world might likely be able to focus on irrelevant things leading to delusions so you're stuck in delusions or lack of cognition, meaning either way you'd be stuck in these delusions. This can lead to inner speech misattribution, where your own thoughts get experienced as external voices. You can’t tell what came from you and what didn’t. Or underactive — it’s harder to think clearly, shift attention, or reality-check what’s happening leading to prediction failure. Prediction updating — is the brain’s ability to change its expectations about the world when new information proves those expectations wrong. Our mind makes predictions — like hearing footsteps and expecting to see a person. Prediction updating is the brain’s ability to change its expectations when new information proves them wrong. In psychosis, people often have inaccurate, fixed beliefs or misinterpreted stimulation, but their brain fails to update when those predictions are wrong. For example, someone might hear voices but not see anybody — instead ofinstead of correcting the mistake, their brain holds onto the belief, and is unable to correct it, which amplifies hallucinations and delusions, making them feel more real and harder to shake.\nApophenia + Confabulation – our mind’s tendency to look for patterns in unrelated things — like trying to find meaning in lottery numbers. This likely evolved to help us survive by spotting danger. But in psychosis, this becomes hyperactive, especially when paired with misattributed salience (when the brain gives too much importance to things that aren’t actually important). This means irrelevant information gets connected through false pattern recognition, likely as a survival response to the new and excessive. For example, someone might see a black cat and believe it’s a secret message from the government — the brain finds too much meaning in something random.\nConfabulation – Our mind can sometimes confuse memories with imaginings, known as confabulation, often seen in specific brain injuries and dementia as they share similar brain regions. Confabulation becomes extreme — the brain fills in missing or confusing info with distorted explanation built on their psychotic experiences. i.e., someone might remember being watched by their neighbors and telepathically communicating with them. However, in reality they were simply in their bedroom staring at a wall.\n\nEssentially or basically, here’s how it all connects to trigger psychosis:\nIt starts with dopamine dysregulation — when dopamine becomes overactive in certain parts of the brain. This doesn’t just make someone feel “good” or “excited” — it actually causes something called dopamine misattribution, where the brain starts treating random, irrelevant stimuli as meaningful. A light flickering, a stranger’s glance, a passing thought — all of it can suddenly feel important or threatening.\nThis leads to salience misattribution — the brain loses its ability to filter what matters from what doesn’t. Instead, it starts giving too much significance to neutral or meaningless events, trying to find patterns or hidden messages in them. It's like the mind goes into detective mode, trying to protect itself by explaining what feels like a chaotic flood of sensory input.\nThen there’s a breakdown in something called prediction error updating. Normally, your brain constantly checks whether your beliefs match reality — it updates based on new information. But in psychosis, this system malfunctions. So if someone starts to form a false belief — like thinking someone is spying on them — their brain doesn’t correct it, even when there’s no evidence. That belief just sticks.\nAnd this is where cognitive rigidity comes in. Once those beliefs form, the person has a hard time letting go of them. They can’t shift perspectives easily or consider alternative explanations. The mind becomes stuck in its own story.\nOn top of all that, the Default Mode Network (DMN) — the system tied to imagination, daydreaming, and internal self-talk — becomes overactive. Normally, it’s where you go when you're lost in thought. But in psychosis, that line between imagination and reality starts to blur. So your internal voice, your inner world, starts to feel just as real — or even more real — than the external world. A reminder that your inner world might likely be able to focus on irrelevant things, leading to delusions — so you're stuck in delusions or lacking cognition, meaning either way you'd be stuck in these delusions. This can lead to inner speech misattribution, where your own thoughts get experienced as external voices. You can’t tell what came from you and what didn’t.\n\nSo now the person is:\n\nhypersensitive to meaningless things,\n\nassigning deep meaning to them,\n\nforming rigid false beliefs about them,\n\nand getting trapped in a self-reinforcing loop of internal thinking, blocking out a lot of the outside world, making it feel real or potentially all that feels completely real.\n\n\nAnd the scariest part is that each of these systems feeds into the others. Salience misattribution fuels delusional beliefs. Prediction updating failure makes them unshakable. The DMN keeps replaying them internally. The brain tries to protect itself — but ends up reinforcing the very thing it’s trying to escape from. That’s how psychosis becomes not just a break from reality, but a new version of reality that feels impossible to step out of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Wondering if someone could help me out here -\n\nI have an Associates degree in Psychology. Would love to achieve the full BA – but – I am now wondering if Social Worker or Sociology is better suited for me.\n\nReason being: I have zero intentions of pursing work in clinical psychology. I do not want to study towards a Masters level. I don’t have it in me!\n\nMy passion: mental health, recreational therapy, community social work, school counselling and the senior population.\n\nI have a working background in administration for school districts. Really enjoy it, but I know I want more than just office work. I have volunteered for senior living facilities and adored that role.\n\nI would LOVE to find a job in either school counseling/school based mental health/family liaison type roles. Or something helping the senior population.\n\nI have a 5 yr old daughter and the idea of securing a job that fits her school hours is a dream. (yes, I know many other parents will say this and seek it! I am constantly checking my local School district jobs board and applying where I can.)\n\nIf anyone has some advice on which path I should be taking or can give me some ideas on what to research – I would be forever grateful!",

      "title": "How do I return to academic research?",
      "content": "Hi. I am seeking advice on how to return to academic research. \n\nI graduated 2 years ago and worked extremely hard to have a stellar record and research experience, and then completely fell off the wagon and am severely struggling with returning to research. I am looking for some insight on if it is even possible to get accepted to labs given that I have been on a hiatus. \n\nGood things: I graduated with a BSc, 3.8/4.0 GPA from one of the highest ranking universities in Canada. It was a specialist degree, so I took exclusive research and statistics courses not offered with typical programs. I did an independent honours thesis under a lab/supervisor at my school in tandem with a massive mental health hospital/facility and got to work with real clinical data in exactly the field I want to work in (forensic juveniles). I was lucky enough to work with the head clinical psychologist of this forensic clinic. I have some other research experience from this same university lab before my thesis, working on a scoping review on gender dysphoria. I also have experience volunteering in women’s therapy groups, and am currently working as a clinic admin and psychometric assistant.\n\nBad things: I did not keep in touch with anybody. I have not gotten any additional research experience since I graduated in 2023. I tried to apply to forensic labs but haven’t received any response. I did not leave on the best of terms with the clinical psychologist from the forensic clinic due to my own negligence and lack of initiative (disgusting fumble I know, I probably could’ve been working with her in exactly the position I wanted to right now). I have no publications. All of my research experience was online due to covid, and I worked independently for a lot of it, so I feel I am missing some critical skills and experiences when it comes to being an RA.  \n\nI am feeling really lost as to how to return. I hate cold emailing and don’t know how to make myself sound like an attractive candidate for labs. I do not want to pursue counseling, I am not interested in focusing on therapy. I also cannot return to my supervisor’s lab, as their research is focused on gender identity studies, and I am exclusively interested in working with forensic populations. \n\nI would love any insight on how to proceed forward. I assume that even if I got into a lab right this moment, I would likely need another two years of experience to be on par with other applicants for PhD programs. I am considering a PsyD, but also do not want to go down this route as it is looked down upon and seems quite costly.\n\nAny advice is appreciated 🩷\n",

I basically have to use JASP to measure the construct validity of the DASS-21 test, specifically using the version validated in Colombia. My sample consists of 106 participants. I was asked to perform an exploratory factor analysis with orthogonal Varimax rotation and polychoric (tetrachoric) correlation. My results show that all items load onto a single factor, and not the three that the test is supposed to have. I tried to find someone who used this type of factor analysis with this test to see if they had the same issue, but it seems no one uses this type of rotation or correlation with this test. I don’t necessarily need three factors to appear, but I do need to know whether getting a single factor is normal and not due to a mistake on my part.\n\n\n",

      "content": "**Question:** Can an individual experience secondary traumatic stress without being a carer or professional? Specifically if they are not continuously exposed to the same traumatic stimuli.\n\n  \n**Context:** My question stems from a conversation I had with one person. They noted that they experience symptoms that are in line with PTSD, but they have not experienced any specific trauma. The next logical deduction by their psychologist then became secondary traumatic stress (STS), which we acknowledge was not a DSM-5 recognized disorder, but rather a criterion for PTSD. Again, this deduction did not make sense as the individual was not a carer, professional or \"receiver of traumatic information\" for lack of better phrasing. Yet, things like news broadcasts, unpleasant movies, or any type of unsolicited negative information triggered responses that were both clinically significant and meet the criteria for a diagnosis of PTSD (with the exception of section A in the diagnostic criteria of PTSD in the dsm-5), so much so that they take SSRIs to manage their symptoms. \n\n  \nSo the question lies: Is STS an accurate means to describe these symptoms? Is there something else that closer in line with the symptoms they experience?\n\n\n\n",

      "content": "Hello! New to this subreddit and might not entirely qualify as a psych student yet haha—I’m in high school and have done a psych elective. But the field really fascinates me and I’m hoping to pursue a career in Psychology later down the line. The problem is, I’m not sure what route would be best for my interests, and if there’s even a position that combines all or most of them. I figure this sub might have some advice (hopefully).\n\n\n\nHere’s the breakdown of what interests me the most:\n\nI’m very interested in learning about mental health conditions (Including disorders like depression and neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s), abnormal behaviors, and I love to analyze things psychologically (I watch a lot of tv shows with psychologically complex characters and dissecting them & what makes them tick is my favorite pass time). I also particularly enjoy seeing how events in development affect mental health later on, though im still not sure if id like to specialize in anything like that.\n\nI’m not sure if this is quite considered part of the psychology field, but I am also very interested in contractable disease that damage the brain which can affect behaviors and psychological functioning—like prion diseases, rabies, or brain-eating amoebas.\n\nI also enjoy research and writing papers and my favorite subject in school is always biology. I also enjoy learning about the physical components of the human brain and nervous systems and how the structure correlates to behaviors. \n\nGenerally, I greatly enjoy anything that has to do with pattern recognition and making connections—like connecting certain behaviors to a condition or an event that shaped a person. I consider myself great at analysis and have a genuine passion for researching this subject and having my own “a-ha” moments.\n\n\n\nHere’s some things I am worried will be a problem or would generally like to share and know more about:\n\nI’m not an overly ambitious person. Yes, I intend to attend college and get a degree, but I’m not quite sure I’d want to go so far as being a licensed psychologist or anything like that. Are there any smaller scale positions that maybe work under/alongside psychologists or perform similar tasks? (Obviously depending on which subset of the field we’re talking about). And I’m not just referring to teaching or researching positions; I’m aware of those. I guess I’m more so asking if there’s a “nurse” equivalent in psychology haha.\n\nI also am not interested in doing counseling or therapy positions (I’m messed up myself as it is and don’t trust myself to give other people advice or have the patience for it)\n\nWhile I don’t want to be a top-tier doctor doing ground-breaking research and revolutionizing the field, necessarily, I do think I’d enjoy positions that are a bit more science-y based (hence why im not super interested in the therapy side)\n\n\n\nBonus question: Do certificates matter at all if you plan on getting a degree anyway? I’ve seen some summer courses in which you can earn psych certificates and I genuinely enjoy learning about this stuff so much that I kind of want to do one, but they cost money and I don’t want it to be a “waste” if getting a college degree will just trump that and it won’t have any significance anymore.\n\nIf you’ve read all of this and/or commented thank you so much lol",

      "content": "Hello everyone! I'm currently stuck between counseling, audiology, or psychology masters degree. I have a college degree in BS Psych and planning to take my masters at UST or UP.\n\nRight now I’m leaning more to counseling, since I really enjoyed my internship at the school guidance office (I could definitely see myself working there). Audiology also caught my interest because of its high demand (but I'm also considering the disadvantage since my college degree doesn't align much to it).\n\nI'm just wondering which of these degree is more in demand right now, especially here in the Philippines or even abroad? Any insights or experiences would be super helpful!",

I’ve been applying to behavioral health tech roles and actually have a Zoom interview coming up for one I found on LinkedIn.\n\nThat said, I recently saw a per diem *paid* research support role at the Smidt Heart Institute in LA. It’s not psych-related, but it *is* legitimate research work, and the only listed requirement is a high school diploma (I’m about to start my psych undergrad at community college).\n\nLong term, I’m aiming for a Clinical Psych PhD with dual board certification in neuropsychology and forensic psychology (ABPP-CN and ABPP-FP). I know research is the biggest factor for PhD programs, and I’m wondering: would this kind of experience be beneficial down the line, even if it’s not directly in my field? Could it help me stand out for more relevant psych lab roles at university?\n\nMy thought process right now is that I want to get involved in anything and everything that I can. But I also don't know if I should be more targeted in my approach, at least when it comes to research. \n\nAny insights from folks who’ve gone this route, or from anyone in grad admissions, would be super appreciated.

      "title": "Online Student - Pathway to Grad School and Beyond?",
      "content": "Hey guys. 18 y/o online Psychology student in the US. About halfway done with my degree so far. I'm not really a fan of online school much at all because it's boring and isolating and I retain all the information pretty poorly because most of it is just competency-based, but it's allowing me to graduate debt-free and I should be finished sometime within the next 6-ish months. \n\nI'm not really sure what area of psychology I wanna go into, but I know I'm going to grad school because otherwise this will have been a giant waste of time, and I don't have any ideas for a better industry to go into because everything else seems at least moderately worse than psych in one way or another. My issue with grad school -- being an online student -- is that I won't have any projects or research experience to cite, I won't have any connections or professional network, I won't really have anything.\n\nNow, mourning the loss of my College Experience(tm) is one thing, but I feel like I'm going to be graduating unprepared for whatever comes after, in academics, in professional connections, in experience, etc. Plus, even though I had straight A's in every high school and community college course I've ever had, my school uses a Pass/Fail system that doesn't calculate GPA, but would be closest to an equivalent 3.0.\n\nSo, I ask, what should I be doing to prepare myself and set myself up for success? How can I figure out what field/path within psychology is for me? Anything from clinical to counseling to teaching, marketing, research, and everything in-between seems intriguing, and I lack any experience to differentiate between what's for me and what isn't. Am I cooked if I try to apply to a Master's program, or eventually a doctoral one after? Any advice for going about paying for all this? I've heard Masters are are much harder to pay for than doctorates, but doctoral programs are also notoriously hard to get into.\n\nAny and all advice much appreciated! Thanks guys.",

I currently hold a Master of TESOL but I’ve always had an interest in psychology and I’ve finally decided to follow my passion.\n\nI’ve spoken to a few people who have studied psychology and I’ve received mixed responses. Some loved it and felt they learned a lot, while others felt it was a waste of time and money.\n\nMy goal is not to get into the clinical side. What I hope to achieve is a better understanding of myself and the world around me why we think the way we think, and what our thoughts and worldviews reveal about ourselves and others.\n\nEvery time I speak to someone with a psychology degree I feel like they have a deeper sense of maturity, understanding and empathy. I would love to work in a school as a teacher, and I believe that having a better understanding of my students would help me become a more effective and supportive teacher.\n\nPlease share your thoughts. Do you think studying a Bachelor of Psychology will help me in the way I hope it will?\n\nAlso, which university would you recommend? So far I’m leaning towards Griffith, as it offers a broader perspective. QUT seems more focused on behavioural science, which I think is amazing but would it still be helpful if I’m not aiming to work in the clinical field?\n\n  \nI look forward to hearing your responses.\n\n  \nThanks in advance.

High School AP Psych through PhD level projects. Myself, I'm a PhD candidate in Applied Psych.\n\nThis year's AP curriculum (and all going forward) has changed to be more research-forward. AND the majority of my BA through PhD students are coming to me for APA formatting, research elements, writing and statistical analysis help.\n\nSo I decided to design a (summer) Capstone that will attempt to help everyone. By the end they will have designed a research paper, APA formatted. I'll include most of the elements my students come to me for, including what the AP kids need to start understanding.\n\nI'm thinking a lit analysis. Correlational with moderating factors. I'll teach them how to source and read peer-reviewed articles, the basics of statistical knowledge and analysis, formatting it, etc. It will serve as a warm-up of sorts.\n\nI used to do this with a small handful of my AP students from 2009-2016. I partnered with a local university and my students ended up being the first high school students to present at regional conferences.\n\n**Anyway! Feedback welcomed!** If you were an AP kid or a math/research-phobic university student, what else would you want or need from this project?\n\n[Here's a link to where I review it in more detail. ](https://keith-michael-g.kit.com/de1b11d808)\n\nThank you!\n\nKeith",

However, I’ve always had a strong inner calling towards psychology, especially clinical psychology. Over time, this interest has grown into a deep and persistent aspiration to transition into the field and eventually practice as a clinical psychologist.\n\nThe biggest challenge I’m facing right now is financial. Shifting from IT to psychology would mean starting from scratch — enrolling in a new academic path, pursuing a master's degree, possibly even a Ph.D. — all of which require time, energy, and financial support. I also carry the weight of social and career expectations, having invested years preparing for and entering the tech industry.\n\nDespite this, my passion for psychology doesn’t go away. I find myself naturally drawn to understanding human behavior, emotions, trauma, and the unconscious. Sometimes it feels like the more I try to suppress this urge in favor of a “stable” path, the stronger it becomes.\n\nI feel torn between two worlds: one that offers stability but feels misaligned with my inner truth, and another that feels deeply meaningful but comes with uncertainty and sacrifice. I’m seeking clarity on how to navigate this phase — how to honor my passion while also being responsible toward my practical needs.\n\nIf anyone has been in a similar place or has insights on how to balance such a major career shift, I would truly appreciate your thoughts.",

      "content": "I’m three years in a literature and linguistics degree with an innovation and entrepreneurship minor, chose to concentrate in linguistics (kinda regret it cuz I enjoy literature more) I have one year left in Qatar. Some opportunities happened and I ended up moving to the US. But I’m thinking of going back finishing my year then doing masters in clinical psychology. Parents want me to transfer my hours to a uni in the US, the most that can be transferred is a year or two at MOST. They want me to stay so I can get the citizenship quicker, plus they don’t want me risking coming in and out of the country. But the bachelors I was receiving in Qatar was for free compared to what I’ll be receiving in the US which will not be free. What do I do. I have a permanent residency so there is some financial aid options but I’ll still need to take out some loans. I hate staying in this limbo state of no degree and the jobs I’ve tried out so far are not looking good. Plus I’ll be living in a dorm so that’s extra loans too vs me staying with family in qatar. I’m also slightly worried about the job opportunities, like does it matter if I have a degree in literature then a masters in psych?",

I had initially narrowed down my list to six schools: University of San Francisco, The Wright Institute, Alliant International University (San Diego and San Francisco), University of La Verne, Cal Lutheran, and the Chicago School of Professional Psychology (Los Angeles). Although they seemed like good programs Alliant International’s EPPP pass rate is around 54%, and although The Chicago School has a good EPPP rate, it has a bad reputation from what I've read. I’m kind of uncertain about whether to apply to just two schools in the fall. La Verne and Cal Lutheran are still on my radar, but they come with additional requirements (like Pepperdine, which I ruled out due to needing a masters). La Verne requires the GRE, and Cal Lutheran requires a research background, which is possible, but I kind of want to be realistic (I am looking into taking the GRE exam).\n\nAlliant and The Chicago School have been crossed out of my list.\n\nI will be a second-year undergrad in the fall who is planning to graduate in the spring (I hope that makes sense) I came into college with all of my GEs done during high school (I was dual-enrolled). With that being said I plan on going to grad school for Clinical psychology. I currently have a 3.2 GPA with the final grades of my first year of college. I will be doing an internship in the upcoming semester working with children and adolescents with autism: this includes working with clinicians as they assess children, working with parents, etc. Perhaps my chances are pretty low getting into a program but, I have professors who say they'd write me strong LoRs.",

      "title": "Do I need a PhD to achieve my “dream” career? Advice needed!",
      "content": "Hi there! I am currently deciding if I should pursue a PhD in Clinical or Community Psychology. Any advice/thoughts would be extremely appreciated! Here is what I am thinking:\n\nMy dream career is to be a \"Director\" of program design, implementation, and evaluation. I want to lead a team that collaborates with schools, nonprofits, and other community-based organizations to develop, run, and evaluate programs that promote well-being and positive development—things like resilience, social connection, mental health habits, and reduced substance use—especially for marginalized communities. Although, I am happy to leave the evaluation process up to other research collaborators \n\nI’d also love to manage the implementation of these services and host community-facing outreach events like workshops and presentations (for psychoed. reasons + spreading awareness about these programs). On the side (though not essential), I’d be interested in consulting for other groups, sitting on advisory boards/councils, and possibly teaching or doing some clinical work.\n\nI am having trouble understanding if I need a PhD to achieve this dream career or not. Some reasons why I would want to pursue a PhD include: \n1. Better credibility. I feel like this type of career comes quicker/would be better suited for those with a PhD, since a PhD technically gives more \"credibility.\" \n2. Becoming an expert in the content of the programs I would like to design.  \n3. Understanding how to design programs/interventions. A part of designing successful programs is learning how to develop the program itself; I think getting a PhD will help me in these aspects. \n4. I like the idea of community psychology. Based on my research about this field, I love how applied it is — community psychology seems to be focused on prevention via interventions, which is something I 100% align with and would want to do.\n5. Ability to have a flexible career. I assume that a PhD will give me the ability to work in various settings and “open more doors” for me. \n\nHere are the few reasons why I believe I should not pursue a PhD: \n1. I enjoy the idea of research, but don’t want to be the person doing it. Don’t get me wrong, I think research is cool and very impactful work. But I just can’t keep doing it anymore. I have been doing research-related activities for the past four years, joining a total of 6 different psychology research labs. It is finally time for me to be completely honest to myself and admit that I DO NOT like the research process. I dislike doing any statistical analysis and using R, writing manuscripts, synthesizing academic papers, and worrying about the nuances of the methodologies (e.g. trying to find the right measures to use, defining your variables so clearly/carefully, etc.). All of that is way too isolating and boring for me. \n2. I don’t care about publishing papers or presenting at conferences. All of this seems to be \"for show\" to me, and I could care less about writing papers.\n3. I don’t want to be in academia at all. I feel like PhD programs push you to be in academia, and I want to run as far away from that as possible.  \n\nGiven my dream career and the reasons listed above, do you think I need/should pursue a PhD in clinical/community psychology? \n\nThank you so much for reading through!\n\nTL;DR: Wanting to pursue a career in \"Director\" of program design, implementation, and evaluation for community-based well-being. Not sure if I need a PhD, or if a Master suffices.\n",

I have a bachelors and masters degree in an unrelated field (architecture), and I’m curious if anyone has any insight into how this would be viewed in the admissions process.

Or, third option, is it not that relevant and the rest of my application is more important? I’m mostly wondering if I should do more to bolster my application (volunteer or try to find related work, in addition to taking as many psych classes as I can from local community colleges), or if I should possibly just expect that it’ll be tough to get in this year and I should expect to reapply next year.\n\nI’d love to hear from anyone who was accepted into a grad program with a non-psych undergrad degree, or anyone else who may have advice to offer.

I landed a job teaching high school sciences (Psychology, Biology, and Anatomy) and also fell in love with teaching.\n\nThe perfect combination of what I have studied and what I am doing is becoming a school psychologist. I would love to be able to practice in the educational setting, however... I also have a deep interest for teaching, and especially wish to teach higher education. (High school students are there because they have to be, I'd love to teach students that are there because they want to be lol, and especially to be able to focus primarily on psychology). I know that my MA can only really get me adjunct positions and likely at colleges rather than universities, which I still plan to look into.\n\nMy dilemma now is whether to earn another Masters in Educational Psychology and become licensed to work as a school psychologist, or to bite the bullet and pursue a PsyD in Educational Psychology in its place to have better teaching opportunities while still being able to practice. Don't even get me started on a degree in education!! Does anyone have experience in any and can offer some advice? My reading/research has only made me even more conflicted on what to do. I'm not sure if the PsyD is worth the extra cost and time. I have also read that a PsyD might even get me nowhere when it comes to being able to teach tenured at a university rather than adjunct at a college. My mind is in scrambles trying to decide what to do! I do miss school and feel a bit stagnant as I have not learned anything new, nor do I see myself advancing very much at my current job... Doctor also has a nice ring to it. Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "content": "Hi everyone, i’m a current developmental psychology masters student and i’m incredibly worried about the future of my career and the path I chose to take. When i started my bachelors, I always had the impression that I would never be a therapist and that I was interested in research or non-therapy based work. Now, a year into my masters, I feel like there are no jobs for me (since I have no psychology license and will not receive one since my masters is research based) and even the jobs i could have (research coordinator, lab manager, research assistant, etc.) are just not available right now.\nI’ve recently considered switching into more therapy based pathway (speech therapy/child therapy) but that would require me to start over entirely with getting accepted into another program and paying more money for a different masters program. I am just so overwhelmed and have no idea where to go or even start from here. I only have some teaching experience and research from my bachelors and i’m finding that i’m not qualified for any of the psych jobs i’m looking at. If anyone could share some advice (especially if your focus is developmental).",

Are honors classes something you need to complete specific majors? Do they tie directly into your major coursework, or are they more about general enrichment? Also, what exactly is an honors thesis, how long is it, when do you typically do it, and is it something that applies to all students or just those in an honors program?\n\nFor context: there are only a couple of honors psych classes at my CC, and one isn’t available online (my first semester is fully online), so I’m trying to figure out if this is something I should even be thinking about right now, or if it’s more relevant later at the 4-year level.

I got my PGCE in 2016 from the University of Warwick, I’ve been teaching for nearly 9 years but my heads been turning all the way through….\n\nI realised part way through my undergraduate that my academic interest didn’t really lie in theatre, though I enjoyed performance, my intellectual curiosity was more centred around the psychology of acting and the transference of social skills and development. I did my dissertation on drama therapy - and this is something that’s stuck since. I’ve always thought studying psychology would be interesting and always felt called to it- but the unconfident younger me thought I wasn’t cut out for it…so I didn’t choose it for my Alevels either. \n\nI’m seriously considering persuing a doctorate in psychology and would like to explore cognitive, developmental or social psychology. Perhaps returning to elements of drama/play therapy as part of my research. \n\nI know I need to go on a BPS accredited course and I am pulled to study at Russel group universities. I notice university of Bath will be introducing a conversion course in the academic year- but their wording in the website is confusing; it says their course it to ‘prepare you to study a masters’. So do some conversion courses just work as foundation years? And then you do a masters? University of Bristol says theirs is one year and you get a MSc. \n\nWhat I’m saying is- pathways? Best road to take? I know my Undergraduate subject probably won’t give me the key to access a non conversion course, even with the PGCE leverage. \n\nLooking for advice with all this in mind? \nThank you in advance! ",

I'm just wondering if you guys have any knowledge or tips for working towards this? My understanding is that people who do undergraduate degrees in psychology have an advantage because of the research opportunities offered to them from day one (which I don't have as a history student).\n\nAfter my degree I'm planning on doing a BPS accredited conversion - after that I'll have accrued about £65 grand in student debt (and be 24) so I'd like to start working as soon as possible and avoid lengthy full time postgraduate courses. So with my postgraduate training, I'd like to do something which will ultimately lead to a career in practice if I don't do a DClinPsy but also aids in my applications for a DClinPsy. \n\nMy degree, of course, has no relevance to this career path, outside of my dissertation being on representations of trauma which I'm hoping will help with my conversion course applications. \n\nAlso sorry for the typo in the title, this subreddit won't let me say \"psychologist\" for some reason ",

Clinical/Counseling Psychology PHD\n\nHello all,\n\nI am a prospective clinical psychology phd applicant, and i’m looking to see if my research experience is competitive. My stats are below\n\n- 1.5 years in a research lab close to my interests \n\n-an honors capstone individual research study project that will last one semester in my interest that i will attempt to get published.\n\n- another individual study project that will last 2 semesters (one year) in my research interest but adjacent subfield that i will attempt to get published \n\n- a community based research course that lasted one semester that I finished with an A. This is in another field (anthropology) and for credit. I ask because I’m not sure if for credit courses count as research experience. \n\nIn total, I am looking at 3 years of research experience, minus my community based research course. 3.5 if I include it. I ask because when I see people say they have “research experience” it’s typically within a research assistant position. Does individual studies count as research experience? \n\n",

Unfortunately, I have tried to get into research all year, I met with multiple advisors, and they all said that my school just doesn’t have enough research or much at all. I’ve applied to all of the psychology labs there, and they’re just not looking for assistants. Is it possible to go to other schools for research? I’m in Oregon, and it looks like the other schools near me only want their students. I’ve tried local research companies as well and they’re not hiring. I even looked at hospitals. Is there something I can do to boost my resume (I also just love research) while I wait for a spot to open? I’m recovering from a car accident, so I can’t do much anyways. Is a job the only thing I can do while I wait?\n\nAny advice would be appreciated. ",

      "content": "Hey all! I graduated with a B.A. in Psychology in 2019 from a school in the U.S.\n\n I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in the field but after a couple years pursued software engineering... I have been working in tech since then. But now I don't feel truly fulfilled with what I am doing and want a job that brings me satisfaction/ any kind of feeling. I am lucky enough to still have a job in software right now, but am entertaining the idea of applying to a graduate school programs.   \n  \nI am interested in so many different aspects of Psychology but I am a bit overwhelmed with the idea of paying mass amounts of money for grad school if i'm not certain I will want to stay in that specialty/field. How does one decide what path to pursue when it comes to grad school? \n\nSo many areas fascinate me such as child learning/development as well as how these early years shape our lives. But my indecisive brain is overpowering! \n\n  \nI have read that since I have been out of school for so long and don't have any professional experience in the field that working as a Psych technician may be a great opportunity to begin to build a resume. Is it feasible to keep a 9-5 in tech (ample amount of free time during the day) while working part time in a psych job/ maybe even trying to work with professors on assisting with a research paper? \n\n  \nAny advice is welcome! Thanks",

Sooo about a month ago I was rejected from the doctoral program I applied to and I had a meeting with the dean of admissions just to see where I could improve my CV and my experience for the next coming application. Basically I was told I don’t have enough research experience, my references needed to be from people in the psych field and that I didn’t answer properly the question in my personal essay (which is weird because the prompt given was very different than what he told me the admissions board wanted but whatever). I am a forensic psych major (graduating with my masters in one week!) and want to continue my studies in forensics. I do not want to practice therapy  personally, just not for me. He suggested I apply to “school counseling” which is a joke to me because I expressed in my essay while I did learn invaluable things working in a community residence that working with children in particular was not something I want to do, at all. He then suggested family and couples counseling. Am I right to be annoyed that these programs were even suggested to me when it has nothing to do with my chosen path and career goals? Anyways, my question is; do I apply to other clinical psy.d programs in the area, or apply to these pathways that have nothing to do with my intended future goals? Please let me know or if you need further information. ",

      "content": "I'm a recent class 12th graduate (M) from India, robably joining Delhi University (one of the most popular unis in the country) this fall for psych hons. \nA few days back I got to know while reading some news articles online that the university is making some changes in the curriculum of Psychology and Sociology. \n\n\"Delhi university’s standing committee for academic affairs has recommended removing Karl Marx and Thomas Robert Malthus from the 'Population and Society' paper. Both thinkers are pivotal in population theory, and their potential exclusion has raised concerns within the academic community. \n\nThe proposed changes include removing the unit on 'Issues in the Sociology of Food' and adding more books by Indian authors to the 'Sociology of Law' paper, HT reported. These additions aim to incorporate more perspectives on religion.\n\nIn Psychology, topics such as sexual orientation, dating apps, caste and religious identity, Kashmir, and the Israel-Palestine conflict were reportedly marked for removal. In their place, the committee proposed the inclusion of the Mahabharata and Bhagavad Gita to explore the “psychology of peace.'\n\nBeyond sociology, other proposed changes include objections to topics like peasant resistance in the 'Agrarian Sociology' paper.\nSinha mentioned that a reading by historian Prem Chowdhry on honour killings in the 'Kinship and Marriage' paper is also under scrutiny. \nFurthermore, the committee chair also proposed excluding caste and gender themes from the 'Sociology of Science' paper.\"\n\nLike dude, it's quite concerning for me - I'm a humanities nerd and I've noticed a pattern that fascist-leaning governments almost ALWAYS target the higher education (esp the ones which foster critical thinking) in their countries. \nOne example on top of my head is the U. S. president mocking English hons degrees in one of his tweets on X. \n\nAnd as far as the argument of \"integrating native (mythological) knowledge\" goes, I urge the university's committe to do likewise changes in engineering or smth. Claim that ames WebbTelescope was made by ancient Indo-Aryan brahmins or smth. XD\n\nAnyways, fellow social science nerds, what's your take on these changes happening? ",

      "content": "[INTERNATIONAL]\n\nHello,\n\nCurrently having a moment of introspection to myself and was wondering what kind of direction I could go to for my degree. I'm still very early into my journey so there's lots to plan ahead. \n\nI've always been passionate about psychology and if all else fails I don't mind settling to become a clinical psychologist and help diagnose people. However I'm slowly getting the thought that I'm not as good as helping or talking to people as I thought? But I'm still very eager to learn more on what my degree has to offer. Mainly, I would be eager to specialize my knowledge at a particular psychology field and do something with it.\n\nI've been exploring avenues here and there. I'm quite interested in: abnormal psychology, memory, personality... I also find biopsychology interesting but I have LOTS to learn about biopsychology for sure. I'm still getting the hang of my research classes but I find them quite enjoyable, although my proficiency in statistics definitely needs some work. \n\nI've done introductory classes for psychology fields so far and\n- did well on developmental psychology, partly thanks to my Early Childhood Education background. But I no longer want to think about pursuing in developmental psych despite it being my initial plan when I thought about what to use my psychology degree for. I still think learning about human development, from childbirth to death, is interesting, but I don't really want to involve myself in an environment that involves children anymore. I *can* work with children, they're fun, but I'm not cut out for the environmenth haha. And I consider myself quite good with kids, but my prior experience as a preschool teacher has taught me that they are quite the handful.\n- abnormal psychology. I've read the DSM-5 for fun and find mental illnesses manageable to learn. Had a bit of difficulty learning about Introductory stuff on medication but overall it was a fun experience.\n- I was okay with biopsychology/cognitive psychology. I really liked learning about parts of the brain, about synapses... but I definitely need to polish my knowledge a bit more haha. The only thing I found interesting about cognitive psychology was memory. \n- I had no issues with personality and individual differences. I'm very keen on learning more about this. \n- I'm not exactly interested in social psychology.\n\nSome other careers or things I have in mind: I really want to learn about medication and how it affects the human body. This borders into psychiatry territory already but my country has some different pathways to get into medicine stuff, so I want to find a way to get my hands into biopsychology related courses and really be good at it. \n\nI can't really see myself conducting therapy or the sort. \n\nSorry for the lengthy post, but the TLDR is that I have lots in mind that I want to do in the future and I'm very undecided. I'm still a first year student. I need pointers as to how you've decided on the way you've pivoted this degree transitioning into postgraduate (I got my finances well secured at that front, so pursuing postgraduate is not an issue for me).\n\nI'm also very aware that you need research experience and some related activities on the side and I can assure you that I'm doing everything I can to collect as much experience as I can in this front. \n\nThank you so much for reading.

Would it make my application look better?\n\nI was thinking maybe I could take it and if my scores weren’t good just not send them off with my application.\n\nJust kinda unsure about this and if anyone has experience with this that would be great! :)",

Skipping the long story, i’ve been exploring the idea of one day within the next 2-5 years of applying for a Psych PhD, likely counseling psychology, but I’m still learning and exploring options. I’m curious any of your thoughts about this. Am I likely to be accepted with a Masters in MFT or no research experience? even if I have a few years or a therapy license under my belt? Is there potential for career growth between being an LMFT vs a licensed psychologist? Is there a world in which my background in MFT can shine through my work as a psychologist. Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love MFT and couple and family work and am extremely curious if I could find a niche within the couple/family work as a licensed psychologist. I’m definitely doing the inner work to discern why i might be curious of this potential path from my feelings on therapy, the field, to my beliefs about salaries, so i’m definitely looking for more of a logistical perspective. I love psychology and therapy/counseling and academia. Please be kind as this idea is still in its infancy, but please offer your thoughts as well :) \n\nTL;DR: (almost) LP-MFT out of NY thinking of a counseling psych PhD route. ",

I am undergrad (second year) in search of some Introductory To Psychology or even History of Psychology books (possibly covering ancient philosophers/ late psychologists and their findings) and I’m interested in hearing some book recommendations from other Psych students! \n\nI would honestly just re-read my textbooks but I’m looking for a bit more advanced material but I’m not sure what would come after the introductory (as I am still actively learning more about Psychology within school). Plus I work as a Behavioral Technician so I have a pretty okay/good understanding how extreme behavior can be at times. I feel that schooling controls what information I’m receiving as an student and my job limits me to the behavioral field, so I decided to time to lean towards books to get the information I want. I prefer books that are less “textbook-y” but still informative and educational, if that makes sense. Thank you!",

      "content": "Hi folks!\n\nI’ve recently graduated with my B.S. and would (in theory) like to get a PhD in counseling psych so that I can practice, teach, and do research, but I am concerned about finding a faculty member to work with because my past research experiences and current interests are unorthodox for the field, aligning much more with developmental psych.\n\nI am interested in the relationship between media consumption and identity development (in the sense of ascribed identities as well as personality and values)—i.e. I have no interest in psychopathology at all, rather my vision for practice would be helping young people figure out who they are and how to thrive in the world. I have done a lot of independent research on this topic in college and have also worked in labs that focus on cognitive psych concepts and content analysis of media. But even though counseling psych takes a strengths-based, holistic etc. approach, I’ve heard that programs end up being similar to clinical ones, and I’ve personally never encountered any faculty in the field with whom my interests align, though I have not looked super thoroughly yet.\n\nDoes anyone know of any counseling psych programs and/or faculty where there might be a research fit for me or is this unrealistic? I see a possible alternative pathway as getting a PhD in developmental psych and then becoming a life coach, but I am really not thrilled with that idea given how unregulated that industry is and how I’d like to have counseling foundations under my belt.\n\nAny advice here is much appreciated, thanks!",

I already know what I want long-term: to get into a Clinical Psychology PhD program and specialize in forensic neuropsychology. I’ve done the research. I know the brutal acceptance rates, the 2–3+ years of research most applicants have under their belts, the multiple application cycles, the odds. I get it.\n\nI’ve already emailed 30–40 labs, clinics, organizations, and individual practitioners. Just trying to get experience, find my way in, and set myself up as best I can. I *love* psychology. Law, neuroscience, forensics... all of it. Forensic neuropsych is my **dream** field. But I’m scared. Scared that no matter how hard I work, I’ll never get there. That there are just too many variables I can’t control; what labs are open, who’s taking students, what kind of research I can even get into early on, all the way up to matching into the right fellowship for me.\n\nI know I’m probably overthinking this. I know I’m *way* early in the process, and realistically I probably won’t even be taken seriously by most labs or mentors until sophomore or junior year. But when I care about something this much (and get anxious about it) I have a hard time not trying to be 50 steps ahead all the time. It’s like I’m trying to wrestle control from a process that’s full of uncertainty by just doing *everything* I can, even if it’s too soon.\n\nSo my question is: *How much of this path—getting into a PhD program, actually specializing in what you’ve dreamed of—is in your control?* How much of it is just luck, timing, or finding the right mentor at the right moment? And how much is persistence, strategy, and grit?\n\nWould love to hear from anyone who’s been through it, especially if you ever felt this same mix of ambition and helplessness.",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI am 19 years old and currently at my second year at community college. About a year ago, I switched my major to psychology. My initial plan was to get a masters in a certain therapy, most likely in Marriage and Family. Although everyone around me (including myself) agrees that I have the right characteristics for that career, I’m starting to doubt its financial value.\n\nI live in SoCal and things are horrendously expensive. I would obviously not be able to get by comfortably with a masters in MFT, and grad school is probably going to be freaking expensive. To make matters worse, all my cousins are pursuing or have completed engineering degrees and nursing programs 🫠 comparison is the thief of joy but god do I feel extremely confused.\n\nI guess the overall question here is, do I pursue what I’m passionate about or take the safe route and study a degree like engineering. I don’t doubt I can do it, I have always had exceptional grades and math has truly never been a problem with me. \n\nTo my fellow psychology students (although we may be biased) please share your personal experiences and how you decided to stick to psychology. Maybe some reassurance or a reality check",

However, history and politics don't interest me on my own, and while I listen intently if someone else delves into those materials, I dont study those subjects on my own, dont have much interest there. I like mysteries, fiction, tv shows, poetry, music, art, psychology, scientic exploration, but sometimes with my more so-called intellectual friends I talk about emotional issues verbatim a lot. I wish I knew more facts to toss around, to enhance the conversation, but it is difficult to change what I am passionate about, as I am very passionate and get fixated easily. ",

You are literally going to med school. Do you know how many parents would do anything and everything to have a child smart and motivated enough to do md/phd? Save yourself. Find a therapist who does inner child work. Read on growing up with emotionally immature parents and experiences of being children of narcissistic parents. Thankfully there is a lot of support for children like us because unfortunately parents like these and family dynamics like these are far too common. Even as an adult, when I spend time around other normal families, I feel so emotional because it is a constant reminder of how dysfunctional¬†\nmine was/is. You deserve better than that.

They convinced me to apply and I ended up matching to a really good DO school, which has a nicer campus, better faculty and more established clinical rotations than the MD school I interviewed at (1 DO, 1 MD II).\n\n\\[Almost\\] all the physicians I've met, from MD-PhDs, MDs, DOs and IMGs are great doctors (exceptions really just come down to the person rather than the degree type, ex: MDs running a nightmarish internship I applied for). Sure, there are issues, like extra boards and OMM, but in the end of the day, we all get to work our dream jobs and change people's lives for the better.\n\nI think this joke sums it up pretty well for why we have a stigma \"It's House MD, not House DO\"\n\nEdit: If you are aiming for a competitive specialty, like derm or neurosurgery, then you should go MD. It won't be impossible with DO, but it's going to be way harder. That said, a majority of pre-meds will not be aiming for those, so the degree type shouldn't affect your options too significantly, outside of where you match. \n\nTake my advice with a hint of salt though, I haven't attended med school or applied for residency yet.",

Competitive fields and residencies oftentimes still favor MD over DO (though this is kind of silly). So if you‚Äôre going into something competitive, it might be easier to have MD.\n\nOtherwise, the biggest issue is all the extra hoops DOs have. DOs learn OMM, but many don‚Äôt use it after med school because most residency programs don‚Äôt teach it anymore. So you have to learn something you‚Äôll never use again. \n\nThere‚Äôs also COMPLEX, so DOs end up taking (studying for and ***paying***for) both Step and COMPLEX. MDs only take Step.\n\nI‚Äôve noticed many DO schools have bigger class sizes, students might have to go further for rotation experiences, or otherwise might not have as nice of a med school experience as MD schools. I did not have to coordinate or travel for any of my med school rotations for example. This is obviously very dependent on the particular school and NOT a rule.\n\nSo for someone going in to medical school, if you have the choice, I would always recommend MD over DO just because it can make an already rough road a little bit smoother in most cases.\n\nHowever, now that I‚Äôm in residency, I almost never know if my coresidents or attendings are MD, DO, or MBBS.

So you can definitely apply, but I will say you are also pretty young if this is your 1 planned gap year, if financial possible, I'd at least consider taking 2 if you know you know you can score much higher (something should drastically change in your study habits) to lock in the MD.

I think the fishkeeping example is fine, but something stronger could be you proactively supporting other students (if applicable). In terms of the diversity essay, if I were an adcom, I would be more interested in you the applicant, rather than what you thought of others. Schools are more liberal institutions so there shouldn't be too much of a stigma when talking about LGBTQ+ topics. While you may not be as heavily involved in those communities, has it affected your relationship with family or close friends? Could be something to write about.",

Not to mention that they don‚Äôt even include the opinions of actual medical students in whatever their ‚Äúconsensus‚Äù answers is. Like, maybe actually include the POV of people with recent lived experience of going through med school, who understand the challenges that come with it, and would give ethical but realistic answers rather than this idealistic bullshit. This test is designed 100% to benefit the school and the faculty. Every single question is either abt sucking up to your supervisor, calling out your friends, making your school look good no matter what evil they‚Äôre doing, or taking on extra workload even if it kills you. Mark my words, years from now this test is going to be suspended because of how it goes against every progressive moral code we‚Äôve ever fought to reach in the 21st century.

Early morning/afternoon shifts also let me squeeze into shadowing on IM rounds once I became friends with the attending, so it ended up being efficient for knocking off both requirements in the long run.\n\nI know a lot of people knock clinical volunteering but it can be a great experience if you put in the effort.

Don't cheat or condone cheating\n2. Don't lie or condone lying\n3. Give people the chance to do the right thing themselves, but if they don‚Äôt then seek advice from a formal authority (faculty, manager, preceptor, etc)\n4. Be empathetic (if someone does something wrong, don't assume intention but rather ask to understand where they are coming from)\n5. Don't confront individuals in a group setting\n6. Don't belittle people \n7. Offer assistance if someone is struggling but if you are unable, direct them to resources\n8. If you are in a group and one person is causing conflict, be the voice of reason by offering encouraging empathy amongst disgruntled individuals while also independently talking to person causing tensions and offer a mediation. Also work with the group to reach a concensus on how to divide work\n9. Think about how people around you are affected by the situation not just the person the prompt leads you to focus on\n10. Never be the final judge, always include higher ups.\n\nHope this helps. Good luck.",

This is a tough situation and sometimes circumstances lead people to do things that are not a true show of their character. This is one of those things. While a made up letter is obviously not correct, I do think that they should have showed some mercy. I am not necessarily in a place to give you advice, however I think it would be worth taking 2-3+ more years to show growth. Do not worry about your age or others around you moving forward in their careers, focus on yourself. I do not necessarily think your chances for medical school are shot for good. People mess up, and they learn. I am hoping for the best for you and please keep us updated if anything occurs (if you want to share it, of course).",

I'd imagine that getting suspended and not having your bachelors will get your acceptance rescinded, but you need to contact the DO school about that to see what they say. Absolute best case scenario is that you ask to defer and they allow it. The most likely scenario is that you will get the acceptance rescinded (since this a major major IA and there is no guarantee you'll even get your bachelors next year now) and you'll need to take several more years demonstrating growth from this incident, I don't think you should reapply anytime soon in all honesty. The worst case scenario is that since this is such a bad IA, it might kill your app entirely even if you try to apply like 5+ years from now.   \n  \nTL;DR of my comment: Absolutely try and explain this to your DO school since they're gonna need a bachelors which you don't have. If they say no to deferring, you need to think long and hard about whether this path is worth it since you may just be blacklisted from this IA entirely.",

When we mess up or plans shift in a way we were not expecting; I learned that how we react/ respond is just as important. Process and give yourself some grace. I promise you that your value as a person and your desire to pursue medicine truly is who you are. Not grades, not other people's idea of you, not one mistake. Your story, growth, determination, and journey is a better measure of defining you as a person. Yes, logically this mistake will cause a big shift in how you react/ your next actions; but everything we do in life has a consequence. In undergrad, I either could have taken a week to be there with my family during a family member's funeral or I could have studied all week for huge midterm. Contacted professors, and did the \"right thing\" by even showing the \\*required proof\\* of my family member's funeral program. However, I still had 1 professor who said that I still had to take the midterm the following week. (heard the news of the passing at start of week, funeral was that Thursday, and Midterm was Monday). \n\nI made the choice of being there with my family because I was in NO physical or mental state to study. When I took the midterm and failed, I ended up with a D in the course because I could not make-up the terrible grade (only 2 exams and few homework to boost). I lost my scholarships and my my GPA fell. I later did as much as I could to get my scholarships appealed and the grade removed (documentation, appeals court, email screenshots between other professors who let me take exams later vs the other prof). However, I only could have some scholarships retained but my transcript and GPA had to remain affected. \n\n  \nI lost my spirit and felt crushed. But, with support from certain amazing professors, they advocated for my mental health/ courses to take that would boost my GPA, and I was grateful. Having support is vital. Maybe, someone who knows more on medical school admission/ university admission/ student affairs could give you advice on the next steps towards your goals. Also, I can tell you are being hard on yourself (I am prone to that). You are not alone and I know that every step (EVEN LITTLE) towards your growth is PROGRESS! Starting from here, everything you do to overcome this is something to be proud of. Do NOT give up. Maybe, get support from someone higher up, start classes/job/research or something that INSPIRES you and FUELS that drive you have. Take a moment to breath, process everything, give yourself some grace, and do whatever it takes to get that dream as a Dr. Proud of you sharing your story. You got this. \n\nSORRY THIS IS SO LONG!! Good luck, I believe in you",

In truth, I think they will rescind your acceptance, but you should at least try. \n\nIf you are dead set on medical school and want to reapply in the future, you‚Äôll likely need to take several years (3-5?) so that it‚Äôs far enough behind you where you can say ‚Äúthis is something I did when I was young and dumb.‚Äù Falsification and forgery are pretty serious so I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôll be an app killer or not even 5 years from now.

Most people aren‚Äôt innately smarter; they were just fortunate to have opportunities handed to them through their community, networks, and resources. For instance, most medical students come from wealth, and only a small percentage of matriculants each year come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Then there are economically disadvantaged immigrants, who face even greater hurdles. Opportunities for international students in the U.S. are even scarcer.  \n\nThe race toward life‚Äôs ultimate path‚Äîwhether success or comfort as the end goal‚Äîis different for everyone. I wish I could relive the past and make all the right choices, but we must focus on the future. Instead of dwelling or ruminating about the past and mistakes, give your best in your SMP program and not make the same mistakes ever again. There always be times for redemption. You are the creator of your story. You got this.\n\nThere will always be those we envy: 18- to 21-year-olds breezing through undergrad to med school with no gap years through abundant resources, acing exams, and balancing extracurriculars without financial stress. It is simply different circumstances inventing different paths of life. There will be 30- to 40-year-olds from lower socioeconomic backgrounds excelling in medicine later in life. Focus on your end goal; the rest is just history. Yes, the process is agonizing, but in hindsight, it will be just one page of a whole book.",

There's one thing that stood out from his post though: \"-research and academic medicine were definitely big parts of my writing, but I didn't have much to show for research from my undergrad, and I didn't have the opportunity to do research during my gap year.\" That part could have held him back from the top schools who really care about your narrative in medicine with some also wanting really strong research applicants. In general, it's hard to convince an adcom that research and academic medicine is your interest when you don't have the experience to back that up - so yeah if you're into research probably having very extensive research and a number of publications would be best. However, not all applicants are like that. Some are more into public health or policy so they'll have more policy ECs. Others may really only care about the clinical aspects of medicine and have oodles of patient care hours.",

Now, there definitely is some variation between schools and circumstantial context that can affect this. For example, my school recently changed/updated their preclinical curriculum. They gave MUCH more slack to the first class of students going through it since they were basically the guinea pigs, and it was hard to know how closely tied any failing exam grades were to the mode of teaching and testing rather than student effort and knowledge. I was going to explain the whole breakdown of how my school deals with failing, but honestly I'm not even sure it's worth it since \"graded\" ((the internal grades that decide P/F)) components and specific procedures vary widely between programs so my take isn't going to be applicable to a lot of schools.\n\nTLDR; If you get in and care enough to make sure you're keeping up and putting in enough effort, you are going to be okay and it overall is very hard to flunk out.",

In my area, AEMT is the unofficial minimum if you want to get on a 911 ambulance. Conversely, some states don't even recognize AEMT at all and just expand the scope that basics have. \n\nOther than that, if you do go the EMS route, be humble, show initiative, and ask questions. In my experience precepting EMT students, some pre-meds clearly believe they're too good to get in the shit with the peasant ambulance drivers and just will not participate without prompting, and even then only do the bare minimum. Nobody likes those pre-meds. Don't be one of those. \n\nHappy to answer other questions.",

First of all, I disliked my job and was also not paid well, which helped push me in this direction. \n\nHonestly, I think that if I liked my job and had a higher salary, I probably wouldn‚Äôt have switched. I say this because I don‚Äôt think that this was a good financial decision for us and it‚Äôs setting us back in terms of life and family planning. This is more so because I‚Äôm a woman, but also because both of us have demanding careers now. It is what it is, and we‚Äôre preserving our fertility, but sometimes I do look at my friends with their families and think how I wish I could have it all right now without essentially starting over.\n\nIt‚Äôs not an easy decision to make either way, and even though I‚Äôm in medical school and like it it‚Äôs entirely possible that I could‚Äôve been happy with a different career switch, if I had had the right opportunity. My job was kind of dead-end.\n\nIn addition to talking to my spouse, I also talked with my mental health counselor, and used sessions to reflect on my values and what my priorities were. I found that aspect of it really helpful, especially since a lot of premeds have tunnel vision, which is helpful if you‚Äôre set on medicine. Overall, I think my counselor helped me get a broader perspective (and we did discuss other alternative careers), which helped in my feeling that I was making the right decision for myself at the time.\n\nObviously, these are things that you need to talk very openly about with your spouse (also possibly other trusted people in your life), and you need to consider your personal situation.\n\nYeah, I don‚Äôt know if this is helpful at all. I feel like when people post about these kinds of things, a lot of people are just like ‚Äúyeah man go do it!‚Äù And I‚Äôm certainly not trying to tell you not to‚ÄîI mean, look at me‚Äîbut I also think that you really have to look at it and make sure that you‚Äôre making the best decision that you can for yourself‚Ä¶ and that does include how this may affect your spouse and family.\n\nAlso, this is very important‚ÄîI think that you should not compare yourself to people on this forum. Most of them are relatively young and when people say that they‚Äôre nontraditional what they usually mean is that they‚Äôre 23 and they graduated a year ago. A lot of these people have the option of living with their parents and working part times or not working at all while studying for the MCAT. That‚Äôs great for them, but it‚Äôs not your situation‚Ä¶ and that‚Äôs okay!\n\nThe fact is that you are on a longer timeline than they are because you do have to work a full-time job. So maybe what they get done in 3-6 months you get done in 1 year. That‚Äôs fine‚Äîmedical school will always be there, whether you apply now or in a couple of years, and it‚Äôs not a race.\n\nThe point is to get to where you want to be, not to compare yourself to how someone else is doing it. We are all on our own path and on our own timeline!",

Keep going. \n\nSecond, if you only want to do MD, then yes giving up on this cycle is the right choice. You would need at least a 500 for schools to consider you, but even then a 500 is on the lower end and ideally you would want a 510+ for better chances, especially for MD since the schools with lower MCAT medians usually have their 10th percentiles around the 505-506 range. For your upcoming MCAT, if you can't cancel it, maybe just take it and void it and then plan to retake it later in January or March.",

It's unfortunate that instead of discussing her reasons for choosing this path and why it better suits her, she would rather cherry-pick things online that really misconstrue the reality of the situation. Honestly, this type of thing makes it seem like she only respects PAs as professionals and as a field because it's 'more competitive' than medicine. She didn't choose PA because it was harder than medical school and it would be so much better if she just said her reasons clearly. At least that would potentially help others trying to decide between different career paths in healthcare.",

I.e, say 10 people apply to X school, 2 get in. \n\nAnother missing point is selection bias (if one had around a 3.0, they‚Äôd be more likely to apply to PA school than medical school). \n\nIt is basically a waste of brain space. I am not going to go to medical school (decided against).

I specialized in Public Mental Health, which I wouldn't recommend if you want to work at all in the public health field, but I felt like the education in general really broadened my perspective, specifically in learning about disparities and barriers to healthcare. I'm applying to med school this cycle so we'll see if the MPH helped at all lol. \n\nI do agree that the workload was significantly easier than the undergrad premed courses, but I got a ton of experience doing meta-analyses and data analysis, which I never really did during undergrad. The smaller class sizes helped me connect a lot more with professors, so I really enjoyed that aspect. During the MPH, I realized that I didn't want to work in public health. It's tedious, long processes, and a lot of work to make really small changes, which I found somewhat frustrating. The education is actually what really pushed me to apply to med school. \n\nAlso, a lot of programs offer a joint MD/MPH or DO/MPH curriculum, so I think having the MPH already looks pretty good on an application (just speculation). Aside from the degree, I think doing 2 extra years of school (and I took 2 more gap years to work) helped me mature as a person and made me a better applicant. Again, I just submitted my primaries so I can't give any insight as to whether this will actually help me get in, or help in med school, but just my perspective as someone who has an MPH. I would definitely recommend it though, especially if you want to go to med school or work in healthcare in general.",

I feel a common mistake is that a MPH is seen as an expensive stepping stone for med school, but a MPH is a practice-based terminal degree for most, good for networking, and teaches different skillsets that can be combined well with medical training if you're intentional about it. It helped me 1) Figure out what part of health/healthcare I'm passionate about 2) Gain concrete skills, not just knowledge, that I'll use in a clinical career. --My courses were statistics and trial design based but I have classmates who are doing med school now that focused on community program capacity building, qualitative research, business management.",

But for someone who needs hours and has not started a position yet, you should 100% be staying in your apartment and doing at least both part-time, so that you can get established and get the hours, that way it will be smooth sailing by the time school starts. I agree with you about volunteer vs. paid clinical positions, volunteer will always have less responsibility, lower expectations, and lower impact, with the benefit of added flexibility. If you can find a job that maxes out at 3-4 shifts per month, that would be ideal to do before graduating, you can train full-time for a few weeks during the summer if you want. If you do plan on studying for the MCAT this summer I would be cautious, because it will be hard in terms of energy and time if you're starting/doing all these things at a summed full-time level and are also starting/training in a lot of these at the same time. Also I strongly advise against planning to study for the MCAT during schooltime, you just won't have the time. If you will be doing a ton of things over the summer, your MCAT studying can be spaced out, like 6+ months. I have no idea how people study for 2-3 months and take it, but I couldn't. \n\nMy parents are also asian (indian specifically), I completely understand this situation and I know how it makes you feel inside, based on my guessing your parents sound 100% indian to me. I drank the kool aid when they told me i have to come home every summer, and I have been coming home every summer since I started. My parents' 9/11 is me moving away permanently and not being dependent on them anymore. I think they also said they would move with me to med school, which I think is weird but can't say anything about. I have to be grateful for it because of financial reasons and because it would save me a lot of time with chores and stuff. But that comes with someone having an eye on me at all times, but what am I going to do, tell them not to come and to just stay home? If I did any other career and got a full-time job across the country at 22, I think they would've had a heart attack. They lucked out with me being a premed and having years on years of more schooling, where I'm kept in control through financial and academic pressures. Being policed is part of the \"son/daughter of Indian immigrants\" deal that we were born into: The constant rat race of trying to be a \"good kid\", but the specifics/meaning of it changes every year. Have to try to make the best of it.\n\nI think the best way to address this is to just lay out the facts. How staying in the apartment will help you. Why getting a paid clinical job near your apartment would be better for long-term than starting a temporary volunteer clinical job near your family. Same with second gap year vs. one gap year. They can make you feel as stupid/dumb/disorganized/bad as they want, but at the end of the day they can't stop what you do. So if you feel the second gap year will help you, you need to do that. Getting into med school is the biggest priority. Trust me, they will forget about all these antics and everything they said/did when you're in med school.",

If you do add a new LOR later in the cycle (after secondaries) via Interfolio to AMCAS, you can send in an update letter notifying the school.",

After that, you can put in a nice concluding thought, but you have to balance the fact that all of these essays have pretty short character limits, and so you have to see if what you‚Äôre saying is adding high value to answering the prompt.\n\nThe diversity and the adversity essays in particular are more about getting to know you rather than why you want to go to that school, so I think it may sound forced or veer off topic mention there.\n\nI think there‚Äôs an implicit assumption that you‚Äôre going to use your personal identity/diversity and adversity to better the medical school community and connect with patients, so I would make sure you‚Äôre answering the prompt thoroughly first instead of using a ton of space to try to force it into ‚Äúand this is why I want to go to X school,‚Äù which should really be in the ‚Äúwhy us‚Äù question that most schools have.\n\nI also would not fake anything. Like if you didn‚Äôt grow up in a rural area, then don‚Äôt say that you did. Your essay is probably not going to come across well, and it will definitely come across as inauthentic in the interview if they invite you and start asking you about it.

If it's an extra \"cherry on top\" LOR, leave it out because in my opinion (and you can choose to ignore my opinion if you want since I'm an applicant just like you and I wouldn't take it personally) since med schools are assuming you asked people to write you STRONG LORs and if they see that the strongest letter someone you trusted to write you a letter of rec was copy and pasting your resume but in paragraph form, then it wouldn't help make your application stronger.",

The medium score by the acceptance of medical schools \\~510. So I would recommend you focusing on your MCAT study first. \n\nAlso some schools like CWRU and Dartmouth, they have screening of MCAT. If you have a score still on hold before the end of July. Then I would recommend you to try next year because you want to prepare everything and medical schools sent interviews at a rolling basis.\n\nFinally, please upvote if you find this helpful.

I would recommend using your other letters to have your application marked complete so your app can be submitted as early as possible (if you feel strongly about the quality of those other letters), then add in the second LOR whenever. There's no specific timeline to add this as schools review applications at different dates and your application likely will be added to the \"queue\" at different times.¬†\n\n\nGiving the letter writer at least a month is courteous imo. If it gets added September or October, it will likely be seen by someone and that may help with being invited to interview or with post-interview decisions. Interviews for MD admissions run from August to like March-April. Decisions can come in anytime after October 15th, though most schools wait a month after the interview date before communicating a decision.",

UIC is the exception, but they are 85k OOS tuition and idk how willing you would be to pay it if they were your only A, so if you're okay with it then you can keep them.

In terms of wanting to stay at home, yes it would be nice but med applicants often don't have the luxury of staying at home, the vast majority need to move for school so you need to be open to that since there is no guarantee you get in to a school close to you obviously.

In the professional world, no one will care if you're a MD or DO (maybe some super old program director might or if you plan to work at Harvard in academic medicine) and no patient will really care too (some may, but 99% don't). PCOM and Rowan are both wonderful DO programs - you can't go wrong with either one in my opinion. The coursework for MD and DO are the exact same with DOs learning OMM on top of everything so you'll be getting the same education mainly regardless. MDs are holistic and DOs are too - it's just your preference at the end of the day since both degrees will make you a physician. Up to you in the end, but all your options are great - the only thing Rutgers would help you with is if you all of a sudden wanted to do a super competitive specialty like neurosurg or plastics, then they could make your life easier.",

What I would do is withdraw from CCOM (don't mention another acceptance, just say something else, i know it's not the ethically right thing to do but for a school that charges 85k for tuition, fuck it) and then commit to SLU.

Of course, doing great on the MCAT will also help you as well. Your leadership is great, but I think you should def get more clinical hours and non-clinical volunteering as well. Your research is good enough so you can get more if you'd like but the schools that have lower MCAT medians do prioritize service more. I think you can apply next cycle if you can get your hours up a bit more but otherwise things look good (it's really just that MCAT)!",

I mostly play **single-player story games** like God of War, RDR2, The Last of Us (sometimes on PC, sometimes on PS4 Pro). I also watch a lot of movies on my monitor.\n\nIf I upgrade to a **4K 27-inch monitor**, will I **notice a big visual difference** for gaming and movies? Or is the jump from 1080p to 4K on a 27-inch screen not that huge, especially considering the price?\n\nWould love to hear from people who‚Äôve made a similar upgrade!\n\nEdit- Here are my PC Specs\n\n* **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 5 3600\n* **RAM:** 32.0GB DDR4 @ 1599MHz\n* **Motherboard:** MSI B450M PRO-VDH MAX\n* **Graphics:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 SUPER (2GB)\n* **Storage:** 931GB KINGSTON SA2000M81000G (SSD)\n* **Display:** VG270 P (1920x1080 @ 144Hz)",

      "content": "Alright PC master race, I need some reality checks because I'm second-guessing every decision I made üòÖ  \n  \nFinally saved up enough to upgrade from my ancient FX-6300 build (RIP you beautiful disaster). Set myself a $1,800 budget and here's what I ended up with:  \n  \n\\- Ryzen 7 7700X  \n  \n\\- RTX 4070 Super  \n  \n\\- 32GB DDR5-6000  \n  \n\\- B650 motherboard  \n  \n\\- 1TB Gen4 NVMe  \n  \n\\- 750W Gold PSU  \n  \nThe thing is... I originally planned on getting a 4060 Ti to save money, but when I got to Micro Center the sales guy convinced me the 4070 Super was \"way better value for 1440p gaming.\" Ended up spending an extra $200 I didn't really have lmao  \n  \nNow I'm eating ramen for the next month wondering if I actually needed that extra power. I mostly play stuff like Cyberpunk, Baldur's Gate 3, and whatever's free on Epic. Coming from a GTX 970, literally anything would've been an upgrade üíÄ  \n  \nDid I get finessed by the Micro Center employee or is the 4070 Super actually worth the price jump? Part of me thinks I should've stuck with the 4060 Ti and used that $200 for a better monitor instead of my current 1080p setup.  \n  \nAlso wtf is up with DDR5 prices? Spent almost $150 on RAM when I remember buying 16GB DDR4 for like $60 a few years ago. This hobby really said \"your wallet? what wallet?\" ü§£  \n  \nAnyone else constantly question their build choices after the fact? Or am I just overthinking because I can see my bank account crying from here?",

      "content": "Long story short: My fiance√® is big into gaming and has been playing on a trusty old rtx3070 legion 5 laptop for the past 4 years getting 20-30 fps at best. She plays heavily modded games and uses our 98 inch tv that has a port to support 120 Hz @4K.\n\nBuilt her a PC for her 30th hoping to bring more enjoyment. The build is as follows:\n\nRyzen 9 9950X3D\n\nRtx 5090 Aorus Master ICE\n\nX870E Aorus Pro Ice Motherboard\n\nCorsair Dominator DDR5 6400 MHz - 4 x 48GB\n\nSamsung 9100 Pro 2TB - 1x\n\nSamsung 990 Evo Plus 2TB - 3x\n\nAsus ROG Strix 1000w Platinum PSU\n\nAorus Waterforce X II 360 ICE AIO\n\nLian Li Strimers for MB, CPU and GPU\n\n10 x Lian Li Infinity Fans - 4x exhausts/6x intakes\n\nHyte Y70 Ifinity Touch case\n\nID-Cooling Frost x45\n\nAfter everything has been assembled the PC would fire up, case and GPU fans spinning and lighting up, RGB at the motherboard turned on, AIO display would turn on but no monitor signal - regardless of whether HDMI is plugged in to GPU or MB. Red CMOS light on MB lights up at the DRAM led and lots of random numbers were displayed.\n\nTested all the configurations, took out second and fourth RAM stick counting from CPU, then took out first and third and not a thing changed. Eventually I let it run for about two hours and it finally displayed BIOS. Managed to install windows but even after that was done PC would take ages to boot - between 5 and 15 minutes. RAM was running on 3600 MHz and although I didn't expect 6400Mhz out the box it's still a bit slow.\n\nAny idea what am I doing wrong?\n\nWindows is installed on 9100 Pro and with all the other components I would like it to boot instantenously. The red light on CMOS is gone but two digit display still displays different numbers at times.\n\nI've taken a couple of pictures in case I'm missing something here. \n\nHelp! I'm running out of time before her birthday...\n",

And I have no money for GPU now, so for the next 6 month I belive my new CPU will be working with my 3060 :) \nWhat would you do? \nThank you",

      "content": "I‚Äôve been out of the PC market for almost a decade and trying to get back in but the constant out of stock/way over MSRP has been killing me (I just watched a 9070XT go from $720 - already more than I wanted to spend - to $899 overnight). So I heard there is a good chance to buy these cards when they come out at MSRP before they go out of stock, and the 9060XT at $350 has more than enough performance for me. \n\nSo what are some tips and tricks to pick one up at launch tomorrow? Does anyone know what time they go on sale? Should I be looking at sites like Asus that tell direct to customer or looking at PCPartPicker (not sure how fast it updates). Any advice or tips or securing a new card at MSRP in the US is greatly appreciated thanks",

I have a Corsair 650W PSU and the 5070 is running just fine with that amount of power.

I just bought a GTX 1660 Super that will arrive today (or tomorrow) and it's to replace the RX570. \n\nBUT! I remembered that I read that some people used dual GPUs. I looked around and it seems that it used to be more common than now, but almost nobody does it anymore. Still, if it were possible, I would like to know if I can \"install\" both GPUs. \n\nI honestly don't care much of using both at the same time (I don't game at all, I just don't want to throw away a perfectly fine RX 570 that I can't sell because of how old it is), but I read that if you run a Virtual Machine and you also happen to have two GPUs you can make GPU \"passthrough\" to use one on your host machine and another on your VM (this would be very convenient since sometimes I need to boot into my Windows partition just to use After Effects for some simple stuff for my job, and then go back to my Linux installation).\n\nMy real questions, I guess, are:\n\n* Is it possible to run different dual GPUs on a B450M DS3H Motherboard?\n* If it is, how do I physically install both GPUs on the same mobo?\n* Once installed, will my psu wattage suffice? I tried looking on online tools but none lets me add more than one GPU to the calculator.\n\nIf you read until here, thank you! And if you can help in any way, double thank you!\n\nPS: if it helps clarifying anything, I live in a 3rd world country. Yes, I know my proc and GPUs are old, but this is a first step into upgrading my whole system. ",

So is it (still) a thing that good budget SSD's such as Kioxia Exceria Plus G3 and WD SN580 don't work on some Asrock boards? I tried going through PC PartPicker builds with B450M Pro4 and A520M Pro4 boards, and they all seemed to have some older SSD. Both boards are very highly rated on Amazon and such, so you'd think such compatibility issues would've been more prominently featured on user reviews, but I'm just not sure anymore.\n\nSo anyone with actual experience or knowledge on this particular subject?

And what would be the simplest way to do it?\n\nMy biggest concern right now is how to use Windows from the new SSD, but obviously get the data from the old SSD onto the new laptop.\n\nIs it possible to say replace the windows files on the old SSD with the windows files on the new SSD and just put the old SSD into the new laptop?  I ask this because the biggest problem I have is how to use the version of Windows which comes with the new laptop, but also copy over everything I need from my old SSD \n\nGrateful for any advice..

We find that with this setup we can't get past 48+ hours without it crashing at least once.\n\nThe event viewer (before yesterday) seems to consistently give this error:\n\nGetCACaps\n\nGetCACaps: Not Found\n\n{\"Message\":\"The authority\\\\\"amd-keyid-907d65e9b562315997dd5ad086b2b7598957b92c.microsoftaik.azure.net\\\\\"does not exsit.\"}\n\nNot fully sure of what this was, we tried these things:\n\nRun RAM at 3600 MHz (blue screen)\n\nRun RAM at 3200 MHz (crash after 48+ hours)\n\nRun RAM at 3000 MHz (crash after 48+ hours)\n\nRun RAM at 2133 MHz (crash after 48+ hours)\n\nDDU GPU driver, re-install drivers (crash after 48+ hours, did this with each RAM frequency change above)\n\nThe latest run now after DDU also crashed on us, but the error logs don't give any reference to anything anymore, except say \"unexpected crash\".\n\nAt this point these are the only things we haven't done:\n\nReplace GPU riser cable\n\nReplace RAM sticks with different set\n\nReplace CPU\n\nRe-install Windows\n\nBefore we do anything more, obviously we know there's something wrong with the PC, but we also know most people won't leave the PC running for 24 hours.\n\nWe just need some advice here, what's the most likely culprit for these crashes, and is it worth chasing it down knowing it won't really crash in normal use?  The rig can run normally anything (benchmarks, games, etc.) without crashing as long as we don't leave it on for more than 48 hours.\n\nSorry for the long post, would appreciate any advice.\n\nTLDR:  PC can't reach 72 hours left on 24/7 without crashing, but ok on normal use.  Can't diagnose why; wondering if it's worth pursuing the issue or just use as is.\n\n  \nEDIT:  By the way our first suspect is that the RAM sticks are faulty because activating XMP usually results in an immediate blue screen on boot.  So I guess that's the reason why even at 2133, the rig will crash but I am not totally sure.  Hoping the issue resolves after changing to a different kit.\n\nEDIT2:  Want to clarify my comment about leaving PCs on 24/7, I meant not everyone may do that.  Didn‚Äôt mean to generalise.",

      "content": "I bought a Redragon K556 PRO and reviews looked great. Price point was good, affordable, but not bottom of the barrel. So it should be good. For the most part. The metal casing is nice, the buttons feel great, nice strong colors and light schemes when they work.\n\nBut I'm starting to hate it. I bought a new keyboard because I wanted wireless. My keyboard before was great, but my pc sits on the same desk as my work pc and the cord wasn't quite long enough to be comfortable.\n\nMy issues with this keyboard are a few.\n\n\\-The downloaded program sucks. It allows you to change the RBG style and how the colors change, but only while it's plugged in, and even then, the program HAS to stay open for them to take affect. I don't care too much about the color schemes, but the music matching one is cool and would love to use it, but it's not feasible to use it if it has to be plugged in. And this is the ONLY thing the program lets you do. No key binds, macros, nothing else.\n\n\\-It constantly turns itself off to 'save power', leaving me groping around in the dark to hit a button to get it to turn back on. Not too much of an issue, but in a dark room, it sucks. AND it happens every 20-30 seconds. Regardless if it's plugged in or not. On top of that, there's a short 2 second delay before a key will register. So if I'm reading something or doing something for work, or watching a long cutscene in a game and have to jump into combat, it's annoying. not end of the world, but annoying as hell. I am unable to change any of this. I've changed settings in my device manager to prevent turning off to save power, but apparently this is in the keyboard itself, not my pc. So I can't prevent it.\n\nI paid around $80 I think, and I will take the loss and just spend more to buy something better.\n\nWhat wireless backlit keyboards are yall using? I'll pay more for something that is used and trusted by more people. I mostly game, so that's my main use for the keyboard. Hell, I'll even just figure out a USB cable extension and go back to my old keyboard if I must.",

      "content": "Hey, everyone. I have an Asus motherboard, so I use Armoury Crate for my Ryzen 9 9900X CPU (along with a Sapphire Nitro+ 9070 XT, 32GB RAM, if these are at all relevant), so I use Asus' Armoury Crate as a result. I've been monitoring my PC's performance more closely while playing games and found that my CPU gets up to 86 degrees C. Supposedly that's safe, but it's a little too high for my liking.\n\nThe only thing I could think to do in the meantime is manually programming these PWM fans to blast at full speed (Quiet, Standard, and even Turbo speed options aren't effective in keeping it under 86) while I play, as that's the only speed that can get that thing down (and down to 62 degrees average, which is great).\n\nBut I don't want to keep manually doing this thing long term if I can help it. I've looked all over and can't find a good answer. Can I auto set my fans' RPM to go at a level between Turbo and Full Speed the moment this CPU reached 85 degrees? I've tried dragging those things on the X- and Y-axis and that didn't do anything.\n\nAll opinions/help welcome. Thanks!\n\n\\*EDIT\\*\n\nKnew I'd forget something.

      "content": "TLDR; I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôs better to upgrade the motherboard (B650/850) for faster/more current RAM and CPU, or should I keep the outdated motherboard (Dorado HP) and buy a relatively outdated CPU. I currently just bought a 7600 XT 16gb GPU and would like the best CPU to match. Currently have an Intel i5 10400. I mostly do video editing and music production but also game casually. Details below:\n\nSo, I have a very outdated PC (relatively speaking). It‚Äôs an HP Omen 25L, it has the Dorado motherboard, a 1660 Super 6gb NVIDIA, only 8gb of DDR4 RAM, and an Intel i5 10400 CPU. I got it during COVID, and with the specific intention of upgrading the components later on. It is now later on, and I‚Äôm currently on the fence whether I should buy an older CPU that can only fit my outdated motherboard (also so I don‚Äôt need to build a new PC) or if I should just build a new PC all together with a newer motherboard (which I‚Äôm fully prepared to do). The only ‚Äúnew‚Äù hardware I have now is 7600 XT 16gb which I just recently purchased. \n\nIf anybody can give me good advice on all of this because I‚Äôm new to building PCs I would appreciate it! I really just need a fast and reliable rig that I can count on for content creation and gaming. ",

I learned that tt is a trash company at psu after all of this. \n  After a smell test, it's almost definitely a capacitor on the psu blew, as the smell in very strong at that spot. I checked the locations where the psu was connected to the mobo and I can't find any soot or other signs of damage in or around the connections, or even inside the pins of the wires. I checked and the CPU and its socket and it shows no signs of damage akin to overload, the psu connections are free of any signs of visual damage.\n   The only issue is that I have no psu to test anything to see if non-visual damage occurred. I'm already planning to refund and get a better psu, but how concerned should I be about my mobo and other components?\n\nEdit: I forgot I had a scrap computer with a far lower psu (only 300w, so I can't test the gpu which requires 750w) and some mobo lights turned on when connected, the only issue is that I can't even test the CPU to turn on and start the bios, but when I turn on the mobo, ram sticks light up, fans run, and mobo lights power on, along with any plugged in rgba lights.",

      "content": "[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HWnW8Q](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/HWnW8Q)\n\n  \nThis is my basic list with parts I put together.  I've given myself a budget of around $2500-$4000 so I wouldn't mind swapping out parts for more quality if it'll make a big difference. I think I picked a good motherboard based on the lanes and I'm willing to risk the potential dead motherboard. I wouldn't mind changing if something was more reliable though. I think I'm dead set on the case because it's thermals and space for potential upgrades appear to be good. I have no idea about the power supply, but I assume they're all relatively similar. I kind of want to build it myself, but I do have two Microcenters in Ga(Marietta and Duluth) a equal distance away from my location at about 2 hours. If I went the Microcenter route I know they don't have the Antec Pro available. I would be fine with something with comparable thermals. I settled on Vanguard 5070ti because I hate noise, but anything quiet would do. I currently have a 3070ti ftw and I swear one of the fans either ramps up slowly or is getting progressively louder. I also wouldn't mind purchasing additional fans if there was a case with good thermals, but I would need help making sure they're compatible. Any help or opinions would be greatly appreciated. I currently have a 3070ti setup with a H710i case and it gets quite toasty. I want to upgrade to something before it melts itself and maybe tinker around with it to become more knowledgeable about PC parts and troubleshooting issues in general on pc.",

      "content": "Been running the same rig for about 2 years now with zero major issues- until recently. My system suddenly crashed, so I did a forced restart. On boot, the VRAM light on the mobo lit up, and it wouldn‚Äôt go further.\n\nDid the usual troubleshooting:\n\n\\- Re-seated the RAM and GPU  \n\\- Reset CMOS  \n\\- Cleaned the gold contacts on the RAM\n\nAfter several attempts, it finally booted up. So I shut it down to reassemble everything properly. But as soon as I moved the rig back onto my desk- boom, VRAM light again and back to square one.\n\nAt this point, I tested both RAM sticks individually:\n\n\\- One stick works fine in all slots (so I‚Äôm ruling out a mobo issue for now).  \n\\- The other one doesn‚Äôt work in any slot, and if I install both together, I get the VRAM light again and no post.  \n\\- Odd part? The non-working stick still has RGB lighting when plugged in.\n\nI also had an issue with my fans not spinning (though RGB was working). Turns out, I had to flick the PSU switch really fast to get them going- yeah, not exactly ideal. Ended up swapping the RGB hub with a spare and that fixed the fan issue. (fan issues happened during the 2nd round of troubleshooting, after I briefly got the pc running) \n\nNow I‚Äôm wondering:\n\n\\- Is the faulty RAM just dead even though it lights up?  \n\\- Could I have damaged something on the mobo during all the on/off power cycling?  \n\\- Is it possible the PSU surge messed something up?\n\nUnfortunately, I don‚Äôt have access to another rig or test bench (I live in a remote area), so I can‚Äôt test the RAM elsewhere. Would appreciate any thoughts or suggestions before I order a replacement stick.  \nfor clarification, it is running now but only with 1 stick. \n\nCOMPONENTS:   \n\\- RAM: TFORCE delta 2x8  \n\\- CPU: Ryzen5 5500  \n\\- GPU: Intel arc a750  \n\\- PSU: Corsair cv750",

Normally this would be a pretty straightforward choice, but the used market is weird right now. I‚Äôm seeing both cards go for around $700‚Äì800 used where I am.\n\nHere‚Äôs the deal:\n\nI play VR and use frame generation for smoothing\n\nI also run Stable Diffusion and do some light AI work\n\nI'm planning to set up my rig for remote access and potentially run smaller local LLMs\n\n\nBasically, I‚Äôve got edge-case reasons for both options: the 5070 Ti gives me newer tech and better efficiency; the 3090 gives me that big 24GB VRAM which could help with AI/LLM stuff.\n\nHas anyone else faced this choice? What did you go with, and how did it work out? Would love to hear your thoughts or real-world experience!",

      "content": "Hello all! To provide some quick context, I recently bought a Ryzen 7 5800XT to replace my loyal but tired Ryzen 5 2600x. The motherboard I am using for both is an ASRock B450 Steel Legend, and I'm not planning on upgrading for a little while. However, PCPartpicker along with the ASRock website has warned me that I may need to update my bios before my motherboard will be compatible with the CPU. As I bought the mb in 2019, I need to update my bios.\n\nI bought a 64gb usb as I was blissfully unaware of the 32gb cap on windows fat32 formatting. To fix this, I shrunk the drive partition to \\~29gb and then was able to properly format it in diskpart. As far as my admittedly quite brief research has gone, most sources seem to recommend using a 3rd party software able to format the whole drive. I would rather use the command prompt and pretend I'm Mr. Robot.\n\nMy (admittedly fairly stupid) question is whether or not using a fat32 formatted 29gb partition in a 64gb drive will work safely for updating my mb bios, or whether I should just use a 3rd party software as recommended by the various tech support forums I had a gander at. \n\nTLDR: Will using a 29gb partition of a 64gb drive formatted in fat32 blow up my computer when I try to update the bios.\n\nThank you for your time, any advice would be welcome :).",

It would be even more important because this PSU has only 3 PCIE slots and 2 are already on the CPU connector on the motherboard, technically I could use only one since the CPU has way less than 300w TDP, but it would be less ideal.\n\nI know this probably a dumb question, but I'd like just to make sure everything is fine before connecting things and powering everything\n\nThanks a lot guys.",

I went with the following specs:\n\n\t‚Ä¢\tCPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600 with integrated Radeon Graphics\n\t‚Ä¢\tCooler: Stock AMD cooler (with pre-applied thermal paste)\n\t‚Ä¢\tMotherboard: ASUS TUF Gaming B650-PLUS WiFi\n\t‚Ä¢\tRAM: 32GB (2x16GB) Corsair Vengeance DDR5 6000MHz CL36, EXPO\n\t‚Ä¢\tSSD 1: Samsung 980 1TB NVMe (PCIe 3.0)\n\t‚Ä¢\tSSD 2: Kingston NV2 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe\n\t‚Ä¢\tGPU: Palit RTX 5060 Dual 8GB (connected via PCIe)\n\t‚Ä¢\tPSU: Corsair RM650e, 650W, Fully Modular, ATX 3.1, PCIe 5.1\n\t‚Ä¢\tCase: NZXT H6 Flow (white)\n\nA day later all the pieces arrived. I carefully successfully built it in 3-4 hours. First boot: success. Installed Windows 10. Got stuck on ‚ÄúJust a moment‚Äù for over an hour. Reinstalled windows 10. Everything fine. Some issues arise: Sometimes when the PC was turning on there was no monitor signal(it just wouldn‚Äôt turn on) unless I manually turned off the monitor and turned it on again (weird). Installed some drivers. Windows was running a bit wonky and slow etc. \n\nAfter doing some research I realised AM5 is not supported on windows 10 anymore. Thought hey, this must be the issue. Reinstalled windows 11. Reinstalled the drivers (Driver Booster Pro), downloaded League of Legends (just to test the pc) - everything worked great. Started downloading some more games/apps. -> blue screen with the code MEMORY MANAGEMENT. Ok, weird, restarted, things were fine. Opened some windows, they were blank inside, just pure white, no minimize, maximize, and close buttons. Nothing. Ok, weird, restarted the pc. Boots into Bios. What? Restarted. Keeps booting into bios. Realised my first ssd that I had everything on is no longer present. Removed samsung ssd, tried it in all 3 m2 slots, not seen anymore. Ok, it must‚Äôve fried, maybe it was defect.\n\nStart over again, test the kingston ssd in all slots, it worked in all. Great. Reinstall windows, drivers, games. Played a game, wonderful performance. Started downloading some more game - started going slow again. 100% disk used, constantly. With only 2/3 mb/s write/read. Tests in bios for the ssds passed for both (for the samsung when it was still visible lol)\n\nI just gave up. I tried installing some software to check the ram or the ssd, but it was impossibly slow and I just gave up. \n\nCould I have hit the lottery and gotten 2 broken ssds? Could the motherboard be the issue? Are m2‚Äôs just that bad? The total price for the pc was around ‚Ç¨1400. Now I‚Äôm down that cash and also not having a working PC‚Ä¶ Any ideas?\n\nShould I switch to a SATA ssd?\nAny ideas what could‚Äôve broken the ssds?\nM\nSorry for the long post, and thank you.\n\nTl;dr: Built a ‚Ç¨1400 PC with solid parts (Ryzen 5 7600, B650 mobo, 32GB DDR5, 2x NVMe SSDs, RTX 5060).\n\t‚Ä¢\tWindows 10: Stuck, slow, display weirdness ‚Üí upgraded to Windows 11.\n\t‚Ä¢\tSamsung 980 SSD disappeared from BIOS after freeze/BSOD (Memory Management).\n\t‚Ä¢\tKingston NV2 SSD worked for a bit but then slowed down heavily (100% disk, 2-3MB/s).\n\t‚Ä¢\tTried tools like CrystalDisk and RAM checkers but PC became too slow to operate.",

This build would be for productivity (video editing and motion design, mostly to multitask between 2-3 Adobe programs like Premiere Pro and After Effects), but also occasional gaming.\n\nWhich one would you go for and why?",

      "content": "Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX V2  \nRyzen 7 7800x3d  \nRTX 4070  \n\nPotentially of note I am using an older semi modular power supply with only 1x8 pin CPU power whereas the motherboard is newer and has 1x8 pin and a 1x4 pin CPU power connector. At the time I followed the advice of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/11wx2w4/cpu_power_cable_help_please/) and only connected the 8 pin power. It has been running like this with no issue since then. I'm not sure if this might be contributing to the issue. Specifically I have \"Corsair CP-9020103-UK CX Series CX650M ATX/EPS Semi-Modular 80 Plus Bronze 650 W Power Supply Unit - Black\". Populating that additional 4 pin slot would require me to buy a new PSU so I'm reluctant to do that unless I know it's likely to be the issue.\n\nThe original RAM I bought with the CPU/MOBO:\n\nCORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 32GB (2x16GB) DDR5 6000MHz CL36 AMD EXPO Intel XMP iCUE Compatible Computer Memory - Grey (CMK32GX5M2E6000Z36)\n\nThese were placed in slots 2 and 4 and everything has been functioning correctly since building this system 8 months ago.\n\nI recently went back to my amazon order history and ordered an identical 2x16GB set to put in slots 1 and 3 to make it a total of 64GB.\n\nThe problem I am having is that my PC will not post with *anything* in slots 1 and 3. No combinations of slots will allow the PC to post if they include *any* ram in slots 1 and/or 3, old or new. The PC will post and boot as normal with either the new or the old RAM in slots 2, 4 or 2 *and* 4. \n\nThe power comes on and the fans spin but the RGB lighting on the motherboard does not come on and there is no display output. The red DRAM status light is illuminated indicating an issue.\n\nI have reset the CMOS multiple times (for every tested slot configuration) and checked that XMP/EXPO were both disabled. I also allowed the system to run for 10 minutes to see if it was a memory training issue.\n\nI'm a little bit lost on what to try next or if it's a hardware or compatibility issue with the motherboard/memory.\n\nWorth mentioning that the original ram I recieved has the same product code (CMK32GX5M2E6000Z36) as the new RAM but they have differing version numbers they're not 100% identical in the other numbers/versions.\n\nNew: CMK32GX5M2E6000Z36 A8K3T52004FS7L 1.35V ver 3.43.02  \nOld: CMK32GX5M2E6000Z36 A8K3T4402T9GL6 1.35V ver 4.43.05\n\nIs updating the BIOS likely to help? Otherwise would returning the new set and buying a full 4x16GB likely to work? I'm hesitant to do that until I verify that it's not a hardware issue with the motherboard.",

My other requirements are as a workstation, as I use MATLAB and Autodesk Inventor extensively. \n\nWith the required motherboard replacement, I also want to switch to an ITX case for space and aesthetic reasons. I have never built in ITX before, but have built two computers in full towers, so I have experience. I have put together a [provisional list](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/list/RgCffd) subject to modification, keeping the GPU, SSD, and CPU cooler. \n\nMy questions are as follows:\n\n1. Will I see a significant performance increase from the CPU change or decrease from the reduced cooling in a smaller case?\n\n2. Is it reasonable to keep my current 32Gb (5200MHz) of RAM and upgrade to 64 (6000MHz) later down the line, given the difficulties that come with working in ITX cases and assuming that it is not an urgent necessity?\n\n3. To what extent is working in an ITX case more difficult than ATX?\n\n4. Are there specific, common issues that are easy to overlook when builing in ITX?\n\n5. Is an SF PSU required for ITX builds, or are they just a strong reccomendatiom?\n\n6. How would I avoid thermal, and particularly audial, issues given less airflow?",

Then just some extra fans for exhaust/intake and my ssd storage etc. With the GPU it's a tight fit, but its in there, but it's like .5\" from touching the front intake fans on the case... I'm worried that I just don't actually have enough airflow now, does it look ok or should I consider moving to a bigger case and more fans? Those are the current temps while it \"idles\" but during gaming maxed out 4k I've only seen the GPU hit 165f at it's highest for a short time and CPU similar ranges. Am I just tweaking or is it ok?

I'm very concerned that the computer is going to lock up and freeze while I'm typing this message.\n\nLet me go through my parts and what I've done:\n\n* AsRock B850 Riptide Wifi motherboard (this one is new and replaced an ASUS motherboard that was showing the same signs of faults).  When it fails to boot, I get a solid green light (boot device failure).  With the prior ASUS board, I would get a solid white light (VGA error, but see below).\n* G.SKILL Flare X5 Series (AMD Expo) DDR5 RAM 32GB (2x16GB) 6000MT/s I ordered a sescond set specifically to test and see if the first one was faulty -- I tried running MemTest86 but could not complete the test because of the computer freezing...even while running the test just off of a USB flash drive with no other OS.  For what it's worth, my hard drive has never put up an error regarding the RAM except for the first time I installed them in the ASUS motherboard, and even with the freezes the RAM has never failed any pass it has done in MemTest86 (I only made it as deep as 3 passes before freezing though).\n* AMD Ryzen 5 9600X -- apparently the x3d has actual set the CPU on fire issues but I haven't even gotten to that stage that I saw.  I inspected the CPU and the MOBO for damage/bent pins (both the old and the new one) and did not see anything.  The box the CPU came in was damaged but the plastic interior casing did not appear to be damaged\n* PSU -- corsair 750e gold.  It has more than enough power to run these things.  I did buy two 8 pin cables for the motherboard -- although I've never gotten an indication that the power draw was too much.  When the computer freezes, it jsut stops.  The picture doesn't disappear, the screen doesn't turn off.  The PSU is a little over one year old, and I got it when I upgraded my GPU.\n* GPU: RTX 4060ti 16 GB -- yeah, which I have been wondering if this is THE PROBLEM because even with the new motherboard boot-up this morning only one monitor turned on despite both display port cables being plugged into the GPU.  And yet...the GPU works just fine in my old system.  It ran for hours just fine playing games this weekend with both monitors plugged in -- but then again the freezes never occur while playing games specifically.  I think I can rule out the GPU being the issue.  I've had it for a little over a year now.\n* OS is Windows 11.  I did not want to upgrade to Windows 11 but I had to with the ASUS motherboard I returned because otherwise the on board wifi wouldn't work.  I have already done one fix regarding gameinput being doubled that could cause freezes after gameplay.  But the freezing here persists.\n\nI'm on the most up to date motherboard drivers (I had to flash the.  I have previously used DDU to scrub old graphics drivers and I am currently on the March or April drivers (I can't remember, but they were the last stable ones I used).\n\nFor fear of my computer freezing mid sentence, I'm stopping here.  But I'm out of ideas.  It's the CPU.  Or it's the RAM.  Or there is something I'm missing.",

It's unbearable. I connected my PC to my TV for gaming and sit about 3 meters away on the sofa, yet I can clearly hear the coil whine, even with the fans spinning at 1600 RPM.\n\nI tried enabling V-Sync, capping the FPS at 60, and undervolting to 0.89V, which brings the power draw down to around 200W in-game, but the coil whine is still very noticeable and unbearable.\n\nAfter some trial and error, I found that the coil whine is closely tied to the GPU frequency. When I lowered the voltage further to 0.85V, bringing the frequency down to around 2100 MHz, the coil whine finally became bearable (though still noticeable).\n\nIt makes me wonder if the reason this card was on sale is because of the excessive coil whine.\n\nIt even produces slight coil whine when idle. Is it normal?\n\nIs there any fix that can help reduce coil whine? ",

Currently I have a 5800x and 4070 with 32gb RAM and all of these are hitting the limit. Loading datasets crosses the 30gb threshold and i think that the extra cores on the CPU and a better bigger GPU would really help with the compute, compile and inference stuffs that I do.  These are the only stuffs i want to upgrade and would cost me reasonably around 600 euros (considering I factor in selling my CPU and GPU). \n\nBut this will leave only about 100W headroom for anything else.

Assumption is, that whatever study-related stuff comes along, the gaming PC most likely (I think that will be an understatement) should be capable of handling all the word processors of this world.\n\nI put together some components, where I would like to ask some knowledgeable folks to do a sanity check. Mainly, that I am not getting components which are sort of incompatible (I checked with PC Part Picker and assume it is sufficiently solid) and, that the components I chose make sense and provide a solid base for 5+ years of relaxed gaming. \n\nGaming related, she mostly plays Genshin Impact and slowly other mostly IMHO lower impact games.

My question today is in regards to what would be *most beneficial* for my setup as a **video / photo editor, and gamer.** I've gotten everything together, it's working well, temps are great, and now it's just a question of what's best. \n\nPC Specs: \n\n  CPU: AMD Ryzen 5 7600X\n\n  GPU: Zotac Trinity Nvidia RTX 3080 10GB\n\n  MoBo: MSI MAG B650 Tomahawk Wi-Fi\n\n  RAM: Corsair Vengeance DDR5 **\\[6200Mhz 32GB\\]** ***or*** **\\[4400Mhz 64GB\\]**\n\n4400Mhz seems to be where the stability ceiling is for these 4 sticks of DDR5. When running 2 sticks, they of course can reach 6200Mhz. \n\nI've noticed the extra RAM does make make *multi-tasking Adobe Premiere & Adobe Photoshop at the same time* easier for work's efficiency. It excess RAM also seems to reduce the final video rendering time. But I can't help but wonder if the higher speeds would be more beneficial than excess RAM that's only sometimes utilized, as well as what would be optimal for my gaming experience.\n\nI'm still within the return window for 2/4 sticks (32GB), so returning all four sticks for 2x32GB is not an option. Thank you in advance to anyone who helps out :)\n\n",

I swapped a Crucial BALLISTIX 8GB DDR4 2666Mhz CL16 XMP 2.0 with a Corsair Vengeance LPX 8GB DDR4 2666Mhz CL16 XMP 2.0. I checked online the timings and they are almost similar, the Crucial one is a 16-18-18-38 and the Corsair one is a 16-18-18-35. I booted up my pc, saw that both of them were running at 2133Mhz, i decided to try and change that from the BIOS and make them both run at 2666Mhz. They worked for like 2h and then i think i got i BSOD while i was around the house, or the PC crashed in some way (checked the event logger, the id was 41), anyways i didnt have the opportunity to see what happened but i was concerned ofc. I ran the Memory Diagnostics tool, and it detected some kind of problem that, of course, wasnt analyzed in depth. The first thing i did was changing the DRAM speed in the BIOS back to auto, to see if the sticks will stabilize themselves. If there is some sort of timings issue, is there anything i can do to solve it? Im not using any type of XMP or OC for the sticks, i want to use them at their normal potential because my machine isnt that strong.",

I'll occasionally use it for gaming (Hogwarts Legacy and Satisfactory, I don't care about things being maxxed out) but really it's video editing/compositing (Adobe After Effects primarily) and AI hobby-work (running and finetuning small LLMs/Diffusion models) I'll need it for. I'd like something reasonably future-proof for gaming/editing - the AI stuff is just for now.\n\nCurrent specs are:\n\ni5-4760K  \n16GB 1600Mhz DDR3  \nGTX 1070 8GB\n\nThinking about:\n\ni7-14700F  \n64GB 6000Mhz DDR5  \nRTX 5070 12GB  \nWD Black SN850X 1TB  \nASUS B760 Prime Mobo  \nGigabyte UD1000GM 1000W PSU\n\nThe budget's about ¬£1300.

The RTX will be ¬£540, I've seen a lot of places say that 4070Ti 16GB Supers give better performance, but on CEX they're about ¬£650-800. At that point I might as well buy a Palit 5070Ti 16GB which is ¬£750.\n\nQuestion I'd like to ask is whether the original spec I've got is fine or if it's worth boosting the GPU / CPU and if it'll be worth the extra cost? Also any other remarks/advice are welcome!\n\nEdit: beep beep beep!",

      "content": "Hey! I‚Äôm going back home from college this summer, and I‚Äôd like to bring my pc with me. It‚Äôs a mini itx motherboard inside the nr200 case from cooler master. But I‚Äôm a bit nervous about shipping the whole computer and it getting damaged. Since it‚Äôs such a small motherboard what if I just took it out with the cpu and ram attached and just put it in my backpack on the plane with the gpu? That way I could just ship the more durable parts like my drives, power supply, and the case itself. Thoughts? Also is there any way to disassemble the nr200 and try and fit it into a carryon that way? I‚Äôm open ideas, what‚Äôs worked for you?",

The more details the better.**\n\nLooking for any potential upgrades or things people may do differently. Just got a raise at work and can reconfigure things a bit \n\nCounter Strike 2. Video editing capability being an afterthought, minor priority. CS2 is really my main priority, I do play other modern titles and obviously would like some future proofing but I feel like that will all be taken care of by building something capable of running CS2 well above 200 fps on 1440p (1920x1440). My current PC is nearly 4 years old but I could have done better. This time around I want to spend a little more and truly enjoy the benefit.\n\n**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for?

Regardless I need to move on from the pre-built that has died. \n\nSince my time line has moved up I am going to be reusing my 3070 and starting my new build with it until I can get myself a proper gpu. \n\nThe build I had priced out was around $2300 with either a 4080 or 5070 ti of some sort. I am hoping to keep things around $1100 without the gpu. Closer to $1000 would be nice. Although I am hoping to make it painless and just swap the gpu when the time comes so have it more or less ready to go.

      "content": "Hello,\n\nI am wanting to build a new PC but would like to get a second opinion on the parts. I've only ever bought prebuilds, the last one being in 2013 so it's been a while. \n\nHere is what I'm looking at so far:\n\nCase: Aqua 7 Case from Amazon [https://www.amazon.com/Okinos-Pre-Installed-Computer-Panoramic-Tempered/dp/B0CSZ2PH85?th=1](https://www.amazon.com/Okinos-Pre-Installed-Computer-Panoramic-Tempered/dp/B0CSZ2PH85?th=1)\n\nCPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D\n\nMotherboard: ASUS Prime X870-P WiFi OR ASRock Phantom Gaming X870 Riptide WiFi 7\n\nGPU: EVGA RTX 2080 (I know it's an old card but I had one lying around so want to use it for now and eventually upgrade if GPU prices start to come down)\n\nPSU: EVGA 650 watt\n\nRAM: This I'm having trouble with choosing. Is there a specific speed I should be aiming for? For memory storage I am wanting to get possibly 64gb with 2 32gb sticks. \n\nSSD: Also having trouble choosing. I would like to have just one hard drive, 2-4tb SSD with the fastest speeds if possible but don't know what options are good or recommended, especially for these motherboard options. I just want to make sure I'm getting the fastest speed that the mobo ports will accept and be compatible with. \n\nCPU cooler: Also would like some suggestions that would go well with this Mobo/CPU/Case. \n\nWill mainly be using this PC Build for gaming and a little bit of video editing/music production. Using a 1440p monitor and gaming mainly in 1080/1440p. I don't upgrade very often, so I want to make sure I'm getting parts that will be good for a while before I have to upgrade again (besides the GPU which I plan to upgrade sooner). That is why I am thinking of picking an x870 mobo and 9800x3d CPU (please tell me if you don't agree)\n\nThe only items I have currently are the GPU and PSU that I am recycling, everything else I will be ordering. If you could let me know what you think or have any suggestions I would love to hear them. Thank you\n\n",

I have been looking at MSI Mag Tomahawk motherboards for both, but theres some questions I have:\n\n* If I have a PICe 4.0 NVME in a 5.0 m.2 slot that is sharing PICe 5.0 lanes with a usb c 4.0 or PICe slot, will it still share even though the version is older? \n* The wifi 6e -> 7 upgrade and usb c displayport don't seem a necessary upgrade for me, other than that the main difference seems to be the m.2 slots being PCIe 5.0 rather than 4.0 but I am unsure if that would really make a difference for me, the only big pieces of data I have are games, I don't really do much movement of big data. \n* The price difference is about ¬£60, which does not seem worth it for me but maybe there is a difference I am missing between the x670e and x870. \n\nOverall just looking for recommendations between the two really, pretty set on the 9700x. The 9900x is quite a lot more and I dont think I would use it's capability that much.\n  \nThanks in advance",

Not sure about side panel, I think I like the light versions more. Don't really care about RGB, especially if it's more expensive.\n\nBut those 3 are relatively close in pricing, and I don't really know how to separate them. Could you help me?\n\nI'm not going for watercooling, just a basic air set up with a Noctua fan I got a few years ago.\n\nI like the looks of all three of them, I think I slightly prefer the Torrent's looks but it's really close overall and wouldn't mind getting any of them for aesethethic purposes.\n\nThanks!",

Whats the best mother board for the 9950x3D in general and which one is best with 128GB of ram or more?\n\nThank you\n\nIf you need more info: I'll probably put it in a torrent case with a Noctua gen2. 8 TB WD SSD. 5700ti for now, windows 10\n\nThis computer is intended to be a workstation that can cosplay as a gaming pc.",

Hoping someone here might recognize the pattern.\n\n# My current specs:\n\n* **GPU:** RTX 5080\n* **CPU:** Ryzen 7 5700X\n* **RAM:** 32 GB DDR4\n* **Display:** 1440p ultrawide\n* **Storage:** NVMe SSD\n* **OS:** Windows 11 (clean install)\n\n# The actual problem:\n\nIn games like [**BeamNG.drive**](http://BeamNG.drive), **Fortnite**, and others at similar load levels, I'm getting **much lower performance than expected**. The issue is *not* an FPS cap ‚Äî I have frame limits disabled ‚Äî but **CPU and GPU usage rarely go above \\~50%**. It's like the system just isn‚Äôt trying.\n\n* Games feel sluggish or inconsistent\n* Changing settings (low/medium/high/ultra) barely affects FPS\n* V-Sync, G-Sync, power saving, etc. are all disabled\n* Temps, clock speeds, and power draw are fine\n* **Benchmarks work great** ‚Äì full utilization, expected scores\n\nThis exact issue existed before when I had a **GTX 1080 Ti**, so the upgrade to a 5080 changed nothing.\n\n# What I‚Äôve tried:\n\n* Clean Windows install (no OEM tools)\n* Disabling **Core Isolation / Memory Integrity**\n* Turning off **Hardware-accelerated GPU Scheduling (HAGS)**\n* BIOS, chipset, and GPU drivers all updated (with DDU used)\n* Game Mode off, Xbox Game Bar off, overlays off\n* Power plan set to **Ultimate Performance**\n* Removed old drivers including VMware-related stuff\n\n# My theory:\n\n* Not thermal, not hardware failure\n* Benchmarks prove the hardware *can* work as expected\n* Could it be some kind of **Windows driver model**, **scheduler**, or **DirectX-level issue**?\n* Maybe virtualization-related remnants, though I tried removing everything",

This analysis often times requires me to do a lot of embarrassingly parallel computations which is why I have the 24-core i9 processor and why I've got 32GB of RAM.

This is the build I came up with [https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yWbBdb](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/yWbBdb)  \nFor those who don't want to click the link, the build is as follows:  \nan amd 9 9950x cpu, a rtx 5060ti 16gb OC triple fan GPU, 64 gigs of ddr5-6000 cl30 ram, an asrock 870e nova mobo, a 1000w corsair rm1000x SHIFT psu (ik this might be a bit overkill), an arctic III 360 AIO cooler, and 1tb of nv3 nvme storage. The case im thinking of is a fractal xl full size ATX case, since I'm a bit anxious to go for a mid size one.\n\nWould you guys have any thoughts, comments or concerns regarding some of these parts? The current cost of affordable, so its not really a question of saving money. The bigger concern is if it is capable of AI/ML research. If yall have suggestions for any better parts though (or compatibility!!!!), please let me know <3",

      "content": "Hi All,\n\nI need some advice on building a custom PC. \nUsing AMD 9950x3d as cpu and 5080 as gpu what can be best paired motherboard and PSU. \nAlso I am assuming Liquid cooling would be best like an AIO cooler rather than fan cooling? \nUsing ram as gskill trident 32 gb x 2\nI know this looks like an overkill but ig I don't mind spending this much to atleast have good PC for next 5 years. \nObviously gpu may get upgraded and so might cpu but any advice would be greatly appreciated.

      "content": "So i decided to update from windows 10 to 11. I installed it succesfully and started installing some apps & drivers. I opened the task manager and saw that all my SATA SSDs were showing as ATA devices. Booted into bios and set the sata mode from IDE to AHCI. Windows showed a BSOD (inaccessible\\_boot\\_device). After the BSOD my pc rebooted and now it doesnt even boot up BIOS and the system as well. Just a black screen, speaker is silent. Tried resetting my bios > nothing. BUT if i remove all my RAM speaker starts to beep. Tried switching my RAM, CPU, GPU, PSU > nothing. Any suggestions except the service?\n\nCPU: core i5 3470  \nRAM: DDR3 16gb  \nMotherboard: Gigabyte GA-H61M-S1 rev 2.2  \nGPU: GTX 1060  \nPSU: Glacial power 450W\n\nShortly: No display when booting (No bios and system just black screen). Swapped out every component > nothing.",

They can either buy it outright for $17,100 or consign it on their lot for $21,700. If they buy it outright, what does that do to the remainder of my loan? Do I have to pay that in full, can I still make payments on it, or does it depend on the lender? And does anyone know how the consigning option works? They aren’t explaining in a way that I’m understanding what’s going to happen. Any advice is greatly appreciated \n\nEdit: There’s no actual documents or agreements yet. We’re just talking over options and I don’t want to get myself into a worse situation. I’ve never had to sell anything like this before, so I have no idea what to expect in the process. \n\nWhat are the cons of taking out a personal loan to pay the difference?",

      "content": "Like the title says, I've been paying off my car loan as aggressively as possible. After next month, there will be $6,000 left in the balance. I have a $6,000 emergency fund in a hysa. Minimum monthly payment is $360 a month, but I've been putting in an extra 700-1000 every month for the past year just to pay it off sooner. APR is 7.8%. \n\n I'm currently juggling 2 jobs bringing in approx. $4700-5,000 a month. The second job I picked up just to pay this loan off and it's bringing in around 800-1000 a month. I have no other debts.\n\nMy baseline minimum expenses (rent, bills, groceries etc.) is $3000 without the minimum car loan payment. I'm 24 and I basically have nothing in retirement savings yet because I've been focusing on paying this loan off. I keep hearing mixed opinions on balancing paying off debt vs investing but I figure with the APR, paying off the debt faster would be better considering it's a guaranteed return on my money. \n\nShould I just put everything from my emergency fund to pay off this loan off at once, and then start building that fund + open a roth ira simultaneously and start my retirement savings right away? If not, I estimate it would take me another 4-5 months of paying off the loan. I have very stable jobs and not at risk of losing either of them. That being said, I would like to just go back to one job with no car payment soon. Working 70 hours a week for months on end has taken its toll on me. ",

I am being offered term life insurance and have been told by my financial advisor that since I am in good health I should max out the offered life insurance policy (which is 500k). \n\nThere is a chance that I will only stay at this job for maybe 1.5-2 years (I may move) so I am struggling to understand the use of term life insurance. I was told that if I were to leave the company, it would need to be converted to an individual life insurance policy, which I have been told is usually a whole life policy. I am aware of the “scam” that whole life insurance is, so would it be a better idea to just not enroll in life insurance?\n\nI understand that it is an investment in my future (health wise) and once I begin to develop health problems, getting 500k coverage will be harder. I just struggle to see the point if I HAVE to convert it to an individual whole life insurance policy and pay such high premiums.\n\nMaybe I am not understanding it correctly, so I am hoping for some help.

      "title": "Trying to exit a wealth manager relationship",
      "content": "Hello. 42F here married with 2 kids. After being a lurker on this sub for some time, I know that a lot of folks here have put in the time and effort to oversee their own investments versus going down the money manager route. My husband and I took a different path and handed a large chunk of our NW to a wealth manager (big bank) in December 2021. It was not a great time to enter the market as the bubble popped and 2022 was the first year in a LONG time when both stocks and bonds took a beating. However, we weren’’t in it for 12 months. We were in it for the long run. And we took a fairly hands off approach over the next 3 years and let them “do their thing”. Well, over the past 6 months a personal health crisis forced me to take a long hard look at our financial plan, investment allocations and performance. I went deeper than I had ever gone before. And I realized I’ve been majorly let down by the wealth management team we work with. There is a long list of bad recommendations, poor communication, and even straight up lying to our face using financial jargon that made us realize we need to unplug from these guys. Here’s probably the worst example:\n\nOver the 3-year period from 2022-2024 our managed portfolio was almost flat net of fees. I took the data to an independent investment advisor and to 5 of my closest friends to compare and they were all shocked. When I asked my wealth management team about this, they said “we think we did exceedingly well during this period” and protected your money during what they claim to be a turbulent time. But they basically missed the bus on getting out of a aggressively defensive position (low stock allocation) while the S&P surged.\n\nI’ve now met with 6-7 new firms that are both AUM fee based and flat-fee based. I’ve also met with someone that is happy to guide me X times per year to do this on my own. But I just don’t feel the level of confidence the rest of you do to take this on. Plus I have a serious medical condition that requires my time and attention. I am happy to pay the fee if I get real value from someone who is trustworthy. In hindsight I should not have gone with one of the big players.\n\nHow can you help? How does one unwind a position with a wealth manager? Any tips or pitfalls?\n\n* I have 2 529s with them that they charge an advisory fee for. Can i just roll this something low-cost outside and put into some sort of target date funds and forget about it? Both are well funded at $250K a piece.\n* I have an IRA account with $900K in that I want to pull away from them first. Could I do a 529-esque move here and just go with a target date fund somewhere else/cheaper?\n* The main chunk of managed money they have is $2M and I have no idea what it will look like to unwind this. This includes stuff that is super liquid cash equivalents, stuff that is in PE-style investments that are locked in a for a number of year and just stocks & bonds etc. with unrealized gains. So I assume if I move this over to a new money manager I will get hit with some cap gains although as I pointed our earlier it is ALMOST flat if I include YTD so maybe not a big deal.\n* When I do hire a new group to manage my money, I’m thinking of only giving them the $2M and managing the 529s and my IRA (and some smaller Roth IRAs) on my own. I feel like there is enough intel on these subs to guide me. But do people feel that if you hire someone you should just let them take on the whole thing so it is truly set and forget (see earlier comment about medical condition)?\n\nThank you so much for reading my post. I appreciate your thoughts and advice. This is only my 2nd post ever so if I get something wrong I apologize.\n\n",

I went back to my optometrist to get paperwork for the first one, mailed it in, and it was immediately denied as \"insufficient\"--a receipt on my OD's letterhead with my name on it, clearly stating the service paid for was an eye exam. At the end of a frustrating call with the customer service, I stayed on the line for their automated survey --\"How likely are you to recommend UH, from zero to 10?\" I put in zero. They wouldn't accept that as an answer! Hilarious.\n\nI wish I could undo this, but I guess I'm stuck waiting for UH to cancel my FSA for me. Def not worth the hassle.

      "content": "I moved into an apartment in October 2023, and was not charged a security deposit by the leasing office, as one was paid for that unit back in 2019 by someone who has already left. The deposit stays with the lease until it's fully vacated. When I moved in, I was asked to pay a one-month deposit of $900 by another tenant, who said she prepaid the deposit and I could send it to her.  Fast forward to October 2024, and another tenant moved in, replacing someone else who left. The same tenant asked her for a deposit who asked me for one. Turns out she pocketed the money, saying it was in case someone broke something or anything along those lines. The new tenant took her to small claims court, and won. Was this legitimate in terms of a misunderstanding or did she just want a loan from both of us? She took $2100 in total from both \"deposits.\" ",

Should i keep doing this? OR should i max out my payroll roth 401k R2 above, be able to max out more (23,500 since its roth 401K not IRA) and sell off the A1 broker investments to replace my payroll checks (obviously i need cash to pay for things)\n\nI am young, i feel like stocks grow a LOT each year so to me it just seems to make sense to have ALL that growth  be tax free via roth, vs pay all the growth taxes on the end, since growth will be a lot.

I am currently 3 payments behind, will be 4 payments as of the 5th. Insurance is $305. I do always pay that. I opened a capital one platinum and about 6 months ago couldn’t pay it off. Card had a $300 limit. That’s past the payback period. I’m getting paid $29/hr, works out to about $835/40hr every week\nRent is $1300, I pay it as $325 per week, we moved out of the in-laws and had to stay in an Airbnb, ended up setting up payments with the owner to stay here. at that time I was already worried about my credit and not being able to get an apartment. I’m in the union but have paid my dues so I’m technically suspended and have been kicked out of my apprenticeship program. I just got an email today saying my account has been set for repo and need to make immediate payments. I got a flat tire today, and at least 1 more needs replaced.

I’m scared, to open apps, drive places, leave my car places. I’m 20 years old and have had no financial guidance, and have no one to help me in this situation. Me and her aren’t married and her credit is around 675, not sure if that will help/hurt anything.

I think the economy can only be predicted with a magic 8 ball right now, so I'm not gonna wait longer for rates to improve. We have no other debt. Our IRA and 401k will be maxed. We'll have a 6 month emergency fund in a 3.6% saving account. We're not sure how long we'll live in the house. It depends on how long our parents live. They're upper 70s.\n\nI feel like recasting is a safe 6.49% return and lowering our mortgage payment would make it a lot less stressful if one of us lost a job in a bad economy. The other option is to invest it in ETFs. We're following a bogglehead strategy, but I don't want to invest it all at once because I can't time this market. I don't know how best to spread out the investment either. I also don't know how to figure out the expected returns of the ETFs, so it's not easy for me to compare that vs recasting.\n\nWhat happens if the housing market crashes?\nWhat happens to the interest we've already paid on the mortgage? It is about 20k so far. Are we just wasting that?",

I'm a bit more interested in financial planning than he is, and try to optimize my 401k, HSA, HYSA etc. and have been asking him for a while for us to look at his 401k investments to make sure they're on track. Well, we finally did, and I see that he has about $85k, 100% of which is invested in conservative bonds (\\~2.5% APR). We'd like to get this switched into broad market low cost index funds, but any advice on how to do this? Lump sum all at once? Part of it monthly? It's been a volatile few months, so wasn't sure how to best approach this problem. Any advice would be appreciated!",

      "content": "I own a 2014 civic. Credit karma estimates the value at $5800, but its cosmetic condition would presumably make it worth less.\n\nThe paint is peeling off large parts of the vehicle. It looks really bad and makes me unhappy every time I look at it. The interior has stains and some holes in the fabric.\n\nBut, other than looks, there’s nothing wrong with this car. It has 85k miles on it and no signs of any mechanical problems.\n\nEvery time I think about it, I have trouble rationalizing paying $1000 or whatever it would cost to make the car look presentable, when it really affects nothing but my mood. Is there an angle I’m missing here? Is my own satisfaction worth the money if the alternative is buying another car sooner than I might otherwise? I probably wouldn’t do that anyway, so is $1000 worth me not frowning at my car every time I go outside for the next however many years?\n\nEdit: From the comments it seems the answer is “never, it will cost the value of the car or more to paint it well.” So new question: when is it worth it to buy a newer car when your old one runs fine but bums you out by looking terrible?",

Looking for your advice and financial analysis. A few things to consider:\n\n1. I started working as a day trader in late 2023 so my income is unpredictable and variable. It’s also valuable to have more cash available as I continue to refine my trading strategy because I can leverage a larger bankroll to increase my earnings.  \n\n2. Though I made about $85k gross last fiscal year there’s no guarantee that income level continues - I could have a bad several months or even a bad year. There is a certain peace of mind in having a large nest egg of cash. \n\n3. Monthly expenses are about $3800 right now\n\n4. Minimum payment on my loans is about $350 a month \n \n5. I have about $115k of my $125k sitting in a high yield savings account accruing 3.75% APR\n\n6. I’m in my mid 20s, will want to start a family in 5-7 years. I have no other significant debt.\n\n\nMy federal loans are accruing 0% interest right now but it looks like interest will start accruing again this August. I need to decide if I should:\n\n(a) pay off the total amount in a lump sum \n(b) pay down some of the higher interest balance and pay the minimum on the rest of the balance \n(c) pay the minimum payment monthly payment on an income driven repayment plan. This will meant I would have paid $91,400 over 20 years before the loan is eventually forgiven \n(d) another option?\n\nHope I provided as much info as possible for y’all to help me out. I appreciate it in advance!\n\n\n",

My husband is military and is wanting to get out after his contract is up in 2 years. We are thinking of moving to the midwest after he is out. We originally planned to stay down here but between family and a few other factors we are heavily considering selling the house and moving. The cost of living is also expensive and we get killed on insurance (go figure). \n\nWe bought the house for $299,000 at a 7.5%. We were able to refinance it to a 4.99%. However, we now owe $316,000 on our mortgage.. I'm honestly not sure if this is normal or not but it makes me want to be sick looking at that number. The housing market around where we live is moving slow right now, and it's making me anxious we are going to absolutely lose our ass on this house if we try and sell in 2 years. \n\nOn top of this, we also have a couple hundred a month going towards my husbands student loans (6%) and $499 going towards my car (4 more years) and $600 going towards his truck (5 more years). No credit card debt. We both max out our IRAs each year. \n\nI make about $5,300 a month and he makes $4,700. \n\nI feel like I am drowning. Does anyone have any advice? I guess my biggest thing is realistic expectations on selling a house as this is our first one. ",

      "content": "Long story short, I have been sued by a collection agency for a medical debt that I didnt know existed. The debt is from giving birth in WA State, we had insurance through my husband's work but somehow was still billed $3400 back in Feb 2024. The amount automatically went into past due balance in March, then in April I contacted them through mychart asking to make payment arrangements, we couldnt afford to pay the balance and I wasnt working at the time. They offered me $300/month pmt arrangements but asked to call a phone number. As I was dealing with the cmpa baby, postpartum and a toddler at home, I guess I dropped a ball and didnt call to make arrangements. In June, our balance was sent to collections, which we had no idea about because we were making payments towards all these amounts that were also going to the same healthcare provider. We had medical bills coming out of every corner of the house without actually understanding what we were being billed, what the paymetns are going towards etc. By Aug, my husband addressed all these with the healthcare provider and were able to make payment arrangements towards them. Somehow, we still missed this $3400, collection agency actually never called us, we have no recollection of speaking to them, and now in Feb 2025, we were served with the (now) $4k bill. \n\nMaybe we dropped the ball, but we are challenging it - not the amount but the fact that we never even heard from collection agency, why would we not pay this bill when we paid all the other bills. The bill is showing up on my credit report and erkiiiing me. I am working so hard to build my credit in the US, I got a job, finally have a momentum but this is messing it all. Is there anything I can do?  We are just waiting for the hearing date and no idea how to prep ourselves for it. ",

      "content": "Ok so my wife and I bought half of a duplex last year and we’re regretting it big time. We rushed into the decision, and bought mainly because we were sick of renting and it was in a good location. We never really loved the house, but bought it mainly as a financial decision.\n\nOnce we moved in, although the neighbors and realtor assured us we wouldn’t, we heard noise through the shared wall. That coupled with road noise, and the house just generally being ugly and not feeling “us” has us feeling regret. Any repairs feel like a burden, but if it was a home I loved I don’t think I’d mind much. It’s been a mental nightmare, and I just wish I could undo the decision. \n\nAfter this experience, we’d want to rent and only buy again if it’s a place we see ourselves in for 20+ years. We are planning for kids soon, but none yet, and we bought this place thinking we’d live here for at least 5 years , then sell or rent it out at that point. But now I just want out. We’ve owned it for less than a year though. Realistically I think next spring or summer is a good target to sell.\n\nAnyway, here’s our financials\n- total combined income 250K\n- bought for 360K with 20% down\n- mortgage is 2250 a month all in with 5.875 30 year rate\n- aiming to save 5K per month to rebuild savings and prepare if we need to take a loss on it\n- current savings 30K\n\nWhat would you do in my situation?\nI feel dumb for buying this place but I’ve learned a lot, and I just made the best decision at the time. \nRunning the numbers if we sold next year I think we’d be looking at a loss of 20-30 K once fees are factored in.\nI feel like our peace is priceless but I hate to take a loss like this . \n\nIdeal home would be somewhere quiet with at least an acre of land. \n\nEDIT: thanks for all the suggestions. I did forget to mention we moved back to our hometown from across the country so experience a big lifestyle and culture shift that has been tough too. We definitely resonate less with our hometown. In retrospect, it was not wise to buy right away. We should have felt it out and decided if we actually wanted to live here for a while (we don’t lol). But we were in the “renting is throwing money away” mindset (which is far from the truth), so we bought right away.\n\nBased on all the feedback I’ve heard, my plan is going to be to stick it out until January 2026 then reassess if things are getting better or worse in terms of regret. Reassess our financial position as well. And then if we want to sell it (not keen on being a landlord), aim for a May or June 2026 listing. ",

I don't feel comfortable dumping almost $200k into what might turn out to be a toilet if I need that money in the next 4-5 years. \r\n\r\nI could contribute more to college savings I guess? \r\n\r\nIt's aggravating because I wish I could just buy a damn house.

      "content": "My parents have to find a new place to live and asked me(32F) to cosign for a year lease to help. \n\nIn the last year I finally reached a point where I make enough income to support myself. My parents have helped me out up until now. \n\nMy dad gets a pension, and my mom works. However, half her income is undocumented. The pension and documented income come up to less than what the places in the area require. They make enough income to reliably make payments. They can't move into a 55+ because my sister(mid 20's) still lives with them and doesn't have a job. I can't afford to look after her.\n\nEverything I've looked into regarding cosigning seems to be bad news. I said I don't want to cosign, but it's led to arguments and I feel extremely guilty about it. It usually results in \"we took care of you for when you needed help. You can't do the same now?\"\n\nI'm moving into a new place soon with my partner. For reasons I don't want to disclose here, I don't want to move in with them. Living with them has a fair share of difficulties. \n\nThey say I can just sign for a year just so they can get in. Wouldn't the landlord need me to sign again the next year? Is there anything else that could help my parents find a house to rent?\n\nEdit: thank you for the responses everyone. I will not co-sign and have told them about other options. I cannot justify the risk and don't want it to negatively impact my future.",

This would include my kids also moving from the public school system to the private school system in order to be at the same school as her. Her salary would be cut by exactly 10k per year, and we would also have to pay $880 per month for the kids to go to school there (this is with a 40% price reduction), as well as various fees through the year. This comes out to right at a 2k per month loss in HHI. At this point, her salary is essentially all savings/buffer for unexpected expenses - but we are going from almost 4k a month in buffer to 2k. Can we actually afford this? She is very ready to make the jump but the difference in financial benefit has me a little worried. ",

      "content": "I’m 38. My wife passed away last year, and I received life insurance proceeds—this is why I currently have a strong cash position. Right now, my finances look like this:\n\n$260K in cash (HYSA earning 4.3%)\n\n$60K in taxable brokerage accounts\n\n$330K in retirement accounts\n\nMonthly expenses: ~$9,000 (including $3,500/month rent)\n\nI live in Los Angeles and currently rent a two-bedroom apartment. I know I probably need to downsize to cut expenses, but I’m tied to LA because of my job and home ownership here is simply out of reach right now. That’s part of what makes this investment opportunity in Las Vegas more attractive.\n\nMy 75-year-old dad owns a house in Vegas worth ~$520K with a $280K mortgage at 2.8% interest (25 years left). His total monthly payment (PITI) is $1,600. He wants to retire and doesn’t want to deal with being a landlord.\n\nI’m considering giving him $150K-$200k to help him retire (some amount in this range that's fair for both of us), possibly letting him live in the house for one more year while I cover the mortgage, and then renting it out at market rate (~$2,300/month) with a property manager. To avoid triggering the due-on-sale clause, the house would transfer title to a revocable trust with me as the remainder beneficiary.\n\nAfter this deal, I’d still have ~$40K-$90K in cash plus my existing investments.\n\nMy question:\nIs this a better long-term use of the $150K+ than simply investing it in the stock market?\n\nI'd still be renting in Los Angeles for the foreseeable future, although hopefully at a lower amount. \n\nI want to support my dad, be thoughtful with the life insurance proceeds, and make a smart move for my own financial future. Would really appreciate advice from anyone who's weighed similar tradeoffs between real estate and market investing.",

      "content": "Like the title says, I’m way behind for my age due in part to stupid financial decisions when in my early 20s and a combination of the pandemic and Long COVID later on. I’m now 29 with only $10k across my IRAs and an old Roth 401k I’ll be rolling over to my Roth IRA in a couple days. I also have about $14,000 in a HYSA, and no brokerage set up at the moment.\n\nRight before the pandemic hit I started a business that was doing pretty well, until I got COVID and never recovered. I couldn’t continue working and was unable to work for nearly 2 years. Things quickly fell apart and I got behind on rent and my credit cards, all of which went to collections.\n\nOver the course of 2023 and 2024 I paid off the rent and 3 of the credit cards by settling the debts. \nI now just have BOA left because they came after me with a judgment and I had to set up a payment plan. It was the biggest balance with about $7200 left to pay it off. I also have about $1500 on a current credit card from being stuck while traveling (flights canceled cuz of storms, not my choice), replacing my laptop keyboard, and helping my parents pay for medication. \n\nI’m currently a student living on a scholarship and applying for jobs so I don’t technically have an income right now, so I feel like I need my savings because I don’t know how long it’ll take me to get a job after my funding ends. But my credit score is also terrible and I don’t want to be paying BOA for the next five years or paying interest on my current card. I also know I need to be investing outside of my retirement accounts. \n\nSo with all that said, my question is, do I use my savings to pay off all of my debts and be completely debt free or do I put some in a brokerage where it will likely earn more than BOA costs at 3% in yearly fees? My current card is at 29%. Also, will I ever be able to rent again? I’m currently living at home and monthly expenses are around $1300.",

      "content": "Howdy!\n\nWe bought our daughter a 2024 Honda Civic for her last year of high school back in August 2024. It is financed with, Honda Financial, at 4.9% for 60 months. Car price was approximately $30K out the door, with a current balance of approximately $25K.\n\nThe reason we financed, was to attach her name to an installment loan, for good starting credit reporting. We also added her as an authorized user to our American Express cards when she turned 16. These cards have history dating back to the late 90's.\n\nWith the one year mark for the auto loan coming up in August 2025, should we just pay the balance off in full? This money would not come from savings/emergency fund. It's money in a checking account that I just haven't moved over to our brokerage account.\n\nIs a 4.9% interest rate low enough to let it ride for four more years? Moving the extra money to our brokerage account instead? The car payment is $565, and we'd like to just have her start college in August with no debt. She got a full scholarship, so no car payment would be an added bonus.\n\n***Too long, annoyed, didn't feel like reading***\\*\\*:\\*\\* Is it financially smart to pay off a car loan at 4.9% for our daughter, or move the $25k to our brokerage account?\n\n***Edit*****:** The Personal Finance Wiki says to pay down any debt, \"much over 4% interest rate.\"",

      "content": "Hello all,\n\nI have an auto loan through Nissan Motor Acceptance Company, and a sort of weird situation has occurred and I’m not sure what the best thing to do about this is.\n\nMy payment is $609 a month, and is due on the first of every month. I fell behind on payments, and I missed the payments of March 1st, April 1st, and May 1st. On May 15th, the car was repossessed and towed from my house to a repossession lot. On May 16th, the next day, I called Nissan and they told me that I needed to make the payments of the three months that I was behind, and the additional fees for repossession totaling $2800 and I can get my car back.\n\nI made the payment on May 16th, for the entire amount owed and the fees, and on May 17th, I was given permission from the repossession lot after they cleared it with Nissan to get my car back. I picked up the car, and I still have it in my possession right now. The lender has told me that the car is no longer in repossession status.\n\nOn June 1st, I was not able to make the payment because they could not find my account. As of today, June 4th, the account is now showing as closed on Credit Karma. It shows a closure date of May 31st, and shows a remaining balance of a little over $27,000. The account status does NOT say in repossession, or voluntary surrender, it just says “STATUS: CLOSED”, but my brother’s old repossession on shows “STATUS: IN REPOSSESSION” and an old vehicle of mine that I did voluntarily surrender says “STATUS: VOLL SURR” on Credit Karma.\n\nTo reiterate, I am in possession of my vehicle and I’m not behind on payments any further. I have the vehicle registered and insured, and Nissan has restricted my online account to where I cannot make payments. \n\nDo I just get to keep my car for free if I take the credit hit for the remaining balance? If the account is in STATUS: CLOSED, can they still mark it for repossession even though they are not allowing me to make payments, and it’s not currently behind at the time of closure? Why would they let me get the car back, and then still close the account?\n\nPLEASE HELP!",

I really want to be smart and intentional about retirement saving/planning, but I admittedly get totally overwhelmed trying to research on my own. My goal is to keep things simple, low-maintenance, and long-term focused.\n\n# My current Investments: \n\n**Fidelity Taxable Brokerage – $321K**\n\n* FXAIX (S&P 500 index) – $300K\n* FTIHX (Total International) – $13K\n* FXNAX (US Bond) – $8K\n\n**Fidelity Roth IRA – $103K**\n\n* FXAIX – $101K\n* FTIHX – $2K\n\n**Employer's 401k Roth via Vanguard – $34K**\n\n* Vanguard Target Retirement 2055 Trust Select – $34K\n\n  \nAs you can see, almost everything is in FXAIX because my grandfather got me started with my Fidelity account in my mid-20s and told me that was the only mutual fund worth having. A couple years ago, I had a mini panic attack and convinced myself I needed to start diversifying with FTIHX and FXNAX to move toward a 3-fund portfolio I was reading about, but when I didn’t see much return from those, I defaulted back to contributing mostly to FXAIX and have continued since. \n\nUntil recently, I didn’t have an employer with a 401K match, so I prioritized my Roth IRA and then adding to my taxable brokerage. I now realize not contributing to a 401k earlier may have been a mistake, so going forward, my plan is to max out the Roth IRA, then focus on maxing the 401k if possible before doing anything else.\n\n# My Questions:\n\n* For my Roth IRA: Is it considered a poor strategy to stick almost exclusively with FXAIX, even at my age (36)?\n* Should I be putting more into FTIHX again for international exposure — or something else — if I want to stay relatively aggressive but not reckless?\n* Are there other low-cost funds I should consider to round things out without complicating my portfolio too much?\n\nAppreciate any thoughts — I’m still learning and very open to feedback!",

      "content": "Hey there,\n\nSwapped my '24 Malibu (that I hated) for a '23 Jetta yesterday that I was lucky enough to snag for $1-2k below value and do an even trade. I love the car. 13k mi, so practically new.\n\nI'd like people's opinions about GAP and the wheel/tire/door ding/windshield warranty.\n\nThey offered me GAP, but at a steep rate, so I declined. Geico doesn't offer GAP. Are there independent companies that are worth it? Geico is giving me the lowest rate in the area period. I am about $4.5k under water on it, but I do plan to keep it long term. (I do have 11k in savings but don't want to touch it if I don't have to.) Do I just throw all of my extra money (after bills) at the loan for the next few months so I get out from under water ASAP... or should I obtain GAP through an independent company for a bit?\n\nThey also tried to get me into extended warranty, but I've had a bad experiences with issues \"not being covered\" under warranty a few times in the past, so I'm always skeptical of the extended warranty. They did convince me to get the tire/wheel/door ding/windshield warranty at $1414 ($28 per month). I also realized they included key FOB replacement and roadside assistance which I don't need because I'm still covered under WV warranty, so I'm thinking about calling to lower that plan. I'm really conflicted on keeping this. Is it really worth it? In the unlikely event of getting a scrape on my rim or a small door ding, couldn't I find a shop to fix it for a decent price? When I had my chevy, I paid $500 outright for this warranty and felt it was worth it. So having to pay $1414 for it this time around seems like a bit much.\n\nA big part of me would rather have the money in my bank account + high interest savings and just pray that I never need to use it... Thx in advance for your opinions/advice!",

      "content": "Hi Everyone!\n\nI am on the path to paying down my debt after a rough patch. Since starting in April I have paid off my two lower balance credit cards and have about 9K left between 3 cards: $833 on Capital One at 29% APR (I still actively use this card but I am planning to stop), $2610 on Paypal Credit (can’t find APR details), and $5788 on Discover at 27% APR. I also have a 24k auto loan at 13.99% with a $506 monthly payment, which is a terrible interest rate but it was the best I could get at the time. My goal was always to refinance my car loan once I hit the one year mark and my credit score was higher. My score has increased by about 100 points since February, and I am currently sitting at 670 with Transunion and Equifax and a 687 FICO according to Experian. I am expecting my score to increase by about 20 points in the next month.\n\n\n\nI bring home roughly $4000 a month and have about $2600 in expenses including my car and minimum payments. While I can comfortably make those payments, I am not happy with the amount of money I am losing in interest and want to refinance my car loan and hopefully get approved for a 0% APR balance transfer card within the next few months. I don’t want to drop my credit score though by applying to both too quickly or risk not getting approved for one or the other. My main question is- would it be best to refinance my car first then wait a few months to apply for a balance transfer card, or should I get the card first so I am not losing as much to interest then refinance after paying down more of my debt? \n\nThank you!",

Prior to renting, I plan to continue making extra/lump sum payments along the way. \n\nIf I understand correctly, the current monthly interest owed would remain the same regardless of recasting correct? \n\ncurrently I owe \\~4,000 in principal and interest each month \n\nIf I recast my payment goes down to \\~2,900\n\nlets say I Pay 10,000 each month, would the same amount be applied to principal and interest each month or would a greater amount go to principal in the recast scenario? \n\n  \nThanks\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "Better to hold my EV or trade in for a lease?",
      "content": "I know this sub is very anti-lease, but hear me out for the whole situation.\n\n\n\nI have a 2023 Bolt EUV Premiere, just recently got over 5k miles as I don't drive much being WFH. $23750 remaining on the loan. Carmax quotes they'll buy it at 22400 with a short but deep scratch in the door, so I'm underwater. Current monthly is $455 at 8.94% interest - 72 months. Have considered refinancing, but--\n\nI enjoy the Bolt, but the charging speeds are abysmal, range is meh, and having to find somewhere I can wait for 45+ minutes just to go from 20-80% absolutely sucks. I charge from home sometimes, but its an old house (rented) and I'm iffy about leaving it going for too long. I'd like to trade it in for a newer EV, but my only real option to do so rn is leasing.\n\nJust recently moved to OR which has its own additional EV incentives. Due to the move, we're low on funds and also have the reality of higher cost of living here. I have the funds to pay off the remainder of the loan after selling, but I certainly couldn't also then fork over a significant enough down payment. Hence leasing being the only viable option, which also provides lower monthly payments which would be useful with the higher living costs here. Which, yes, I know, lower monthly can be a trap when buying vehicles and one I fell into with this car.  But a $200/mo difference is hard to turn my nose up at.\n\nI've also been hearing lately that leasing EVs, specifically, makes more sense nowadays than buying due to extreme depreciation?  Problem is, the idea of leasing leaves a bad taste in my mouth, whether or not its due to all the bad things I hear. I don't like the idea of being trapped in a leasing cycle, left without a vehicle to sell and stuck finding another lease. If I could lease one of the cars I'd actually likely want to buyout at the end, it'd be different, but my primary option rn is something like the Equinox due to plenty of discounts and Chevy ownership discounts. Which, I can lease from around $260-$350/mo for depending on local dealer.\n\nIf I hold onto the Bolt, I likely won't be able to pay off the loan fast enough to outpace its depreciation. Even if I wait out the next 5 years to finish paying it off, depreciation rates have me looking at likely well under $10k in trade-in/sell value by the end of all this.\n\nSo really I'm not sure what to do or what makes the most sense. Keep it and refinance? Sell and lease a new EV? Maybe look for used of the model I want once the lease is up?",

We live in a low cost of living area, in the Midwest.\n\nUp until now (about 14 years of adulthood?), we have kind of floated along, mostly living within our means, and prioritized having me home with our kids. Up until about a year and a half ago, our general M.O. was just general frugality and gut-dislike of debt, but didn't have much intention or planning or budgeting or financial vision. However, over the last year and a half or so it has been a hobby of mine to learn more about personal finance, and get a better understanding of the general recommendations about how much we should be saving/investing for the long term.\n\nBut our income situation is about to change in a big way!, and I'd like some guidance or thoughts on how that should impact what we should strive to do going forward.\n\nWe are currently at about 53k per year earned income. I am going back to work next week, and will be making 57k, for a combined household income of 110k. Currently, we have about 71k in various retirement investments (somehow? I actually feel really proud of this because it feels like a miracle in so far as for the majority of our adulthood we have not been knowledgeable or intentional about it, and we've always been at a pretty low-ish income).\n\nWhat I'm looking for is how to make sense of the recommendations to have x times your income by age to be on pace. We are sort of on pace at our current income, maybe behind but not too, too shabby. But with a higher income, well, suddenly we'll be far off.\n\nOr is a better way to think about it as x times of the income we actually use to live on? Any thoughts on this would be appreciated!",

My employer was Roth 401(k) but I had rolled over money from a prior employer with a conventional pre-tax 401(k), so in effect I had a mixed 401(k).\nAfter leaving the company, I was lazy about moving the money, but not long later my former employer left John Hancock anyway, so I had to move the money.\n\nI tried to do a lot of research, but it was hard, so I ran out of time and just moved all my money to the person mutual fund IRA part of John hancock. This was all almost two months ago \n\nI logged into the old employer sponsored 401(k) today and it says i have no money. But does this NAV part mean there's money left over? https://imgur.com/gallery/55HsYmW\n\nAlso, not important, but do you guys like John Hancock? The employer sponsered 401(k) seems to have started only hiring people from the Indian subcontinent so they suck at English and are not knowledgeable anymore. The personal IRA part of the company still hires quality english speakers but it's a small part of the company. Also, they're allegedly going to charge me 15.00$ total annually to use them for the personal IRA and personal Roth IRA. Not much money.\n\nThank you\n\n",

It's enrollment for the second half of 2025 and I'm wondering if it's worth keeping it (or upping to 2%) or to just increase my 401k the 1 or 2% instead. I feel very behind.\n\nCompany offers 5% match on the 401k, plus an additional 5% that is fully vested after 3 years. I also get RSUs that vest over 4 years. The units that vested this year are worth over $850 right now, I didn't sell right away and will wait at least a year due to taxes as they are a net gain right now.\n\nI'm pretty much putting away as much as I can without sacrificing my current lifestyle/other savings (such as car/home down payment). \n\nI have no debt, the car down payment savings is preemptive as I have a 8 year old Honda Accord that's in great shape and I plan on driving that until it gives out (so like 20 more years lol). I use YNAB so I know exactly where my money is going.\n\nMy goals: would like to buy a condo within a few years (more realistic than a house in my area which mainly start at $1m). Down payment for that would be: my brokerage account, $10k from IRA and $20k from parents.\n\nThoughts? Or should I drop my 401k contribution to 5% so I can save more towards a down payment for a condo? Majority of my money in the brokerage is in a money market (another good chunk in VTI) since I know I want to use it for a dp.\n",

Let’s say for the sake of this, we are able to sell the house for $300k and realize that $150k equity minus closing costs and whatnot. \n\nOption 1: Sell the house, throw all the equity at the new house. \n\nOption 2: Sell the house, throw 20% down payment ($78k) at the new house, pocket the remaining, and either \n\n2a: invest the full amount remaining and let it grow faster\n\n2b: Take about $30k of it, wipe out the remaining debt we have, clean slate, invest the remaining and let it grow\n\nOption 3: Buy the new house, keep the current house, take a $40k loan against my 401k at 8.5% for 60 months which gets auto deducted from my paycheck and that interest is repaid into my 401k, and use that for the down payment. I can rent the house out for around $2400/month, which will cover the current mortgage and the additional amount for the 401k loan. Once that paid off in 5 years, it’ll become profit.\n\nI can afford all 3 options, I’m just curious what would make most sense for us. \n\nFor additional information about me and where I am financially: 31M, I make $61.50/hr plus $13/hr into my 401k, plus pension, plus free healthcare insurance.

I have looked at some breakeven calculators that are giving a rather generic break even a bit before turning 82.  BUT I would like one that considers continuing investing in IRA / solo 401K.   I imagine my continued earned income will generally pay bills and allow me to qualify for what could be a considerable contribution , which would likely change the break even dynamics.  But meanwhile there may be  some months where the social security will keep bills paid (I may be facing a medical issue, for instance,  that would keep me from working and earning) and to build up some reserves that dwindled due to household repairs and vehicle expenses during the covid years.  So gives me additional peace of mind \"just in case\" but mostly increases my capacity for contributions for 5 or 6 years.  Is there a calculator that allows for such assumptions?",

On  a recent trip to my home country my visa expired and upon reapplying my visa was rejected. My problem now is that all my savings are in my US bank accounts and I have no way of withdrawing them.\n\nI currently have accounts  in Chase Bank and  Capital One bank. Out of these only Chase allows international wire transfers. I have been trying to send a wire transfer to my account in my home country using Chase online banking but every time I try the transfer it gets flagged and my account gets blocked. Thankfully, I have a google voice number associated with my account so I can get OTPs and call Chase support to unlock my account but after trying this multiple times I am afraid that Chase simply wont allow a wire transfer using online banking while I am outside the US. They also have a limit on the maximum wire amount so I will have to do multiple transfers which will probably make them even more suspicious. Chase support have not been helpful and just tell me to visit a branch. At this point I dont know when or if I will get a US visa and if I will ever return to the US. \n\nAll my life savings are currently in the US and I have no way to access them. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do in this situation? Is there someone in Chase I can contact and send them some form of ID? I also have friends in the US who can possibly act on my behalf but I am not sure what the legal process is for that. \n\nIs there any other way I can withdraw my money? I am at a complete loss and am open to any advice.\n\nThanks  \n",

      "content": "I am looking to purchase a new vehicle for my wife. I can afford the cost of the vehicle if we were to pay it in cash and - at a 5.8% - 6% interest rate on the loan - it seems to be the best option for long term savings. That said, I am hoping someone in this thread can suggest any better options I may not have considered. \n\n  \n**Information:**\n\n**- Vehicle:** Toyota RAV 4 Hybrid XSE\n\n**- Approx. Cost OTD:** $47,000 (Give or take depending on negotiations.)\n\n **- Loan rate:** 5.8% -6%. (This is preapproval for full value. No down payment.)\n\n**- Loan Term:** 48-Months\n\n**- Savings interest rate:** Approx. 4.3% (USFR)\n\nI have not started negotiations with the dealers yet. This is all first pass numbers/preapprovals. We do have a trade-in valued at $6,000 and I am open to any range of down payment.\n\nI am not interested in a used car. Only this specific vehicle. Yes, I understand that used can be more cost effective. I am only interested in optimizing this specific purchase. \n\n  \nSo, any thoughts? Would it be best to pay the vehicle in full in cash? Take the loan and pay off early? keep the cash invested at 4% take the loan and use the dividends to pay the difference? Throw the cash into VT and hope for the best over the next 4-years?",

      "content": "Hi! I got convinced to talk to a finance adviser by my serious bf who starting using it last year. (context- both recently done with graduate school and trying to figure out finances/next steps/paying off student debt.) Everything the financial adviser was saying made sense and I have heard before until he started talking about the 7702 plan/cash value. It seemed like not too many down sides besides not getting much of a return the first 4-5 years. He talked about the great returns later and mentioned that money you get out of it they would invest in the stocks while it still gets the set 5.5% fixed interest rate- so earning the set interest while it is invested/rising with the stocks ?? If I am understanding that correctly. Even though it is a life insurance, the financial investor made it sound more like a long term savings plan. He made it sound better than a 401k or roth because of tax benefits and getting some liquid returns- that they would invest. \n\nI looked it up after I had spoken with him and saw that a lot of people did not think it was a good investment, but I didn't get great explanations why that is. Are the returns that bad for the fees you put into it? Investing it in the stock market sounded like a cheat code- is that too good to be true? Do they truly keep all that is in the investment account if you die?\n\nBasically my question is if this plan is worth it or not and why? Thanks!",

I also have my real estate license, but I’m discouraged about starting because it seems like a lot of agents are having trouble even getting business. \n\nMy main priorities are paying off my debt, finishing school and increasing my income. I’m currently majoring in finance. However, I’m in a very toxic living situation with my parent so it makes it hard for me to work to pay for school. I’m a little torn on what to do or where to start after paying off my debt, because 10k won’t cover all of my school expenses. It will cover my tuition for about 2 semesters, unless I decide to take an accelerated degree program. \n \nI was thinking of taking a portion of the money and invest into starting my own e-commerce business and starting trading with a smaller portion of the money. However, these both seem like get rich quick schemes for people to get you to buy their program. Or should I also start real estate part time? I really have no clue what I’m doing. \n\nAny suggestions or tips? Any advice is greatly appreciated!",

I’m planning to do a direct rollover but could use a little guidance on the best approach.\n\nHere’s the background:\nI opened my 401(k) seven years ago when I was 21 and chose a traditional (pre-tax) option, mostly because I didn’t know much about personal finance at the time. In 2023, my former company was acquired, and our 401(k)s were moved into a new plan. During that transition, I was told my prior contributions would stay in a pre-tax bucket, while all new contributions would go into a Roth bucket.\n\nSo currently, I have about $29,000 in a pre-tax bucket and $3,000 in a Roth bucket.\n\nAfter speaking with a Fidelity planning consultant, I was told I have two options for the direct rollover to the new 401(k):\n\n1. Roll both amounts into Roth 401(k) account with Principal. For the $29,000 pre-tax portion, Principal would withhold taxes during the rollover, so I wouldn’t need to pay the IRS out of pocket.\n\n2. Roll the $29,000 into a pre-tax 401(k) and the $3,000 into a Roth 401(k), keeping the tax treatment as-is and deferring taxes on the pre-tax amount until retirement.\n\nMy question:\nWould you recommend converting the entire balance into a Roth 401(k) now (and paying the taxes from the rollover), or is it better to keep the pre-tax portion as-is and pay taxes later in retirement?\n\nFor context, outside of my 401(k), I have:\nAbout $45,000 in a HYSA, $6,000 in a personal Roth IRA, $300 in a brokerage account, and about 40% equity in a home I purchased in 2022.\n\nThanks so much for your help!",

      "content": "Hello everyone -\n\nAs the title suggests, I need some help making an jmportant (and personal) financial decision in my life. I am a 27yo single Male. I have parents who I've deemed will need financial assistance in 4-ish years. I've talked to my parents about this, and though they do not want to force me to aid them financially, I know they'd be very grateful (and children helping out parents in old age aligns with our family's personal beliefs). They are very kind, I love them and I want to them to enjoy their last decade of life.\n\nMy mother is 61 and has worked a restaurant service job her entire adult life. Her income is lower middle class (less than $80K) and has lots of credit card debt she plans on taking to her grave. My father is 62 and severely disabled and therefore unemployed.\n\nI want them to feel at ease by the time my mother hits retirement age. My mother dreads to think about her retirement because she believes there is not much to look forward too (and unless she gets help, I think she won't have much of a retirement).\n\nI plan on saving $150K by EOY 2029 (this is possible for me assuming all of my income sources stay static) for support in the last decade of their life. Support includes:\n\n1. Caretaker for father\n2. Rent assistance (possibly via mortgaging and providing them a home w/ subsidized rent)\n\nI don't think I'll be in the position to house them in my own home in the next 4 years. I'll only be 31 after all and likely still dating or just starting out with marriage. I also would prefer to live independently in my 30s.\n\nHere are some questions I'd like your guys help on (and please feel free to answer in any other way you think is helpful!):\n\n1. Is my solution above the most financially responsible decision I can make? For example, solutions are: (i) I could move them to a LCOL area and pay their rent, (ii) I could mortgage a home and subsidize their rent, (iii) some smarter solution?\n2. I also have the option to move in with them and save rent money. Based on my living means, that means I could save the $150K by EOY 2027. I'd be 29 then and I'm worried I will resent myself or my parents for not having lived on my own and do my own thing.\n3. How do you recommend I save this $150K over the years? HYSA, brokered/bank-issued CD, stocks, etc\n4. What non-financial things can I do for them? Of course I can be positive, provide gifts, maybe re-install religion into their lives?\n\nAny, any help would be helpful. Thank you",

      "content": "My dad served in the military and got benefits to pay for college, which he split and transferred to me and my sister. We both had equal halves that would have paid for 2 out of 4 years. My sister is about two years older than me and stated college a year before I did at an expensive private school. When I went to college, my tuition was considerably cheaper and my dad decided to transfer the remainder of my benefits to my sister (after I already used up two quarters). Legally, he can do this since it's his benefits still, but the problem is he never told me this at the time. The VA ended up paying for my third quarter as well, after the transfer occurred. This created a debt for me only!\nI didn't know about it until years later when they sent a letter stating what was $4000 is now over $14000. Long story short, I called the VA and they never looked into it (they said they would and call me back, never happened and I no longer got any letters). I started working this year and the VA went to court to issue a wage garnishment, which I'm sorting out.\nWhat I want to know is, can they really only charge me? I didn't know my family did that at the time. They told me about the transfer after I started my third quarter, and afterwards we paid out of pocket for mu tuition. I don't even understand how the VA paid for this quarter after the transfer. Everything went smoothly on my sister's end (she got money), but I'm in debt? Imagine having all the money in your bank transferred to a different account, but somehow you withdrew money and now you're in debt for taking money that want your's. How was money existing in two places?\nThe VA also wants to claim the two earlier quarters were also revoked and I need to pay for them as well. I don't understand this. Can they retroactively take away benefits from before my dad filed the transfer of benefits? My dad claims he did not ask for them to do that.\nI can't sort out the timeline of events because my dad and sister won't bother looking into it and how/what they did, and the VA also seems confused on the matter. I just don't want to be labeled a criminal or have anything else in my life impacted by this when it all happened without my knowledge. This just feels so unfair and I feel like I'm handling it alone. I've already written a letter to challenge the debt, but I don't know whether to state how my dad did this without my knowledge. Shouldn't I have signed an acknowledgement of the transfer to literally avoid this situation?",

I have a side gig that grosses about 15k but my profit is probably around  like 9k. My day job is dead-end and cannot amount to a further career in a \"field\" but the side gig has a lot of potential for growth. The day job is pretty much intensive labor. I am passionate about the side gig but it's a ton of work for sure. It is something I could technically come back to in the future but it would have to end due to the traveling (No other option - don't want to elaborate).\n\nI have the option to start a new job that is a lot more skilled, but still easier, and I can definitely learn it. It'll look much better on a resume in the future. It involves moving to the middle of nowhere (not ideal but  I am actually okay with that despite it being an extremely anxiety inducing transition). It involves traveling monday-friday for most of the year. I'd be home only on weekends. It's 50-55k salary, with at least an additional $1200 at the end of each month. So like it's a pretty significant upgrade in pay. From someone I know, their take home (after taxes) is like 3k every 2 weeks and my current take home every 2 weeks is about 1200. Nothing is keeping me in one place, no family etc. I'd be working really tightly with a crew and living with 1 roommate in a hotel throughout the week of work which isn't the biggest deal but is a quality of life downgrade. I am not a social person and I am fearful of things not working out perfectly.\n\nI know to many people in this sub 50-55k is still a small amount of money. But it's a low cost of living area and I'll be able to save copious amounts compared to right now. My goals in life are to own a house some day and have money to travel.. As is I am actually saving money monthly despite low income. In the past year and a half I've somehow managed to build up around a 17k savings. Seems like a lot for my income?  but I am frugal. My rent will probably be a bit cheaper than right now.\n\nThis turned into big block of text and less likely to yield responses which I was trying to avoid but yeah. Does anyone think I'd be stupid to not take the job?",

Treasury direct said the paper bond receipt that I sent in was not the “actual bond” or basically not what they needed but that was all I had as proof on my end. They then had me start the process of lost/stolen bond. I filled out the 1048 form , had it notarized etc. It was submitted and accepted they also had me included my direct deposit info. From what I’ve read the lost / stolen process once they confirm it then gets converted over to an electronic bond and reissued. \n\nThe website says up to 4 months for this process. I have reached out many times and I keep getting told that basically my case hasn’t been assigned yet. It’s now been over 7 months - the bond has reached full maturity years ago and earned over $1k in interest. I’ve looked through forums of others that went through this process and I understand it isn’t quick but I can’t find anybody that’s going on this long with no communication or end game in sight. I did speak to one rep who told me if I’d like I could send in a letter explaining as to why “ I need my money in a quicker timeline” and by doing so that could get my case moved up through the ladder. \n\nThis all seems a bit crazy to me to have to prove why I need my money instead of just giving me what’s rightfully mine. The names are correct , socials match etc. 7 months seems excessive and I’m wondering if anyone else has been through this and how long it took? Is there anything else I can do to try and speed up the process ",

      "title": "I Need Help in Deciding what to do with my Financial Advisor",
      "content": "Hello Everyone,\n\nI am writing because I have been with Raymond James since 2013, but became heavily invested with them in 2019 (+450k of what was around \\~50k before). I have 724k currently invested across a mutual fund, a college savings for my kid, and two IRAs. In the full time I have been with them, I have made a positive increase of 201k. I am in my early 30s, for reference.\n\nI won't lie in that I know little of this world. I went with Raymond James because the advisor was my (late) father's good friend and is the same person responsible for ensuring my widowed mother's money lasts her for the rest of her life without working. Stupidly, I understood our fee schedule much differently than reality (I was overseas as a military member when I began), believing it aligned to what my mom pays. However, I recently discovered this is not the case. I pay RJ 1%, but then I also pay other fees, such as .08% to Nuveen, which is my largest allocation of funds (also my most profitable).\n\nWhen I learned of this, I got into a bit of a panic because I am someone who has issue justifying going out to eat (I live as if all of my investments does not exist), and yet here I am giving car, or event rent, payments to someone who maybe talks to me every 1.5 years in funds.\n\nI began looking into the justifiable value, and I found little. I found the idea of boggleheads, and did some comparison with the S&P 500 / lazy index funds and found that in every scenario, I ended up with better savings than I have now with RJ if I just let it sit somewhere.\n\nI keep telling myself I need to cancel my service, but the tax implications (if I am to reallocate) and the notion of having this money \"back in my hands\" is a lot to take in. I have found two reasons that I often see as \"compelling\" to remain with a FA. The first is that they can manage it without emotion. This used to be big for me, because I was always assuming I would exist during a dip. However, having been through the dips (especially 2020) and knowing that exiting it the worst thing I could do, I do not share this fear anymore. The second is that they have insights/constant monitoring to know when to leave one fund for another, or to invest differently altogether. However, I know no one, including a FA, can predict the market, and to date, mine really has not done anything to help my losses as the market turned down. As I was speaking to him about some of this, he pointed to 2020 to show how he lost me 5% less than the S&P 500 would have, but he failed to point out that my fees that year made those savings non-existent anyway.\n\nI have lurked here and over in boggleheads a lot, and I see many people saying \"buy X, Y, and Z\" and sleep for a few years... but is it really that simple, especially with the amount I have to invest? The one thing I have considered doing differently is talking to a local Financial Planning company. They are fee based, and while they do have an option for a full portfolio management (which is currently more than what RJ is charging), they do what they call a \"Lifecycle Financial Assessment (LFA)\" for 2,000 and they will either allow the customer to do all (or none) of the recommendations, allow their current advisor, or give the option to join as a full client.\n\nI did ask about the retainer program of this LFA and if it could just be done yearly, but they said they would likely recommend every 2-3 years (if they believed it was the best route post our conversation). One benefit of at least the first conversation with them would be how to unwind myself from RJ and their investment strategy (which is below) so I can 1) have the least tax implications 2) remove fee based funds like Nuveen and 3) can help kick start me into what funds match my goals.\n\nI will end by saying what I have told every FA person I have spoken to... I do not desire to be on a personal yacht for retirement, nor do I need to travel to a different country every other week. I just want to keep living in the house we have in the lifestyle we have and leave something behind for our kid while living a charitable life (which is a big factor in why I do want to invest). My wife and I invest fully into both of our 401ks for full matching, we max our IRAs, and we live with our investments, including the large one we received suddenly, as if they did not exist. Our only debt is our mortgage, which I would love to use this to pay off - but we have a 2.99% interest so it just makes no sense :)\n\nWhat would your recommendation be for us?\n\n|Description|Percent of Portfolio|Time Held|\n|:-|:-|:-|\n|NUVEEN DIVIDEND GROWTH FD CL I N/L|14.56%|Mixed|\n|JOHN HANCOCK DISCIPLINED VALUE MID CAP FUND CL I N/L|11.05%|Short|\n|NEUBERGER BERMAN EQUITY INCOME FUND INSTL CL N/L|10.22%|Mixed|\n|AMERICAN FUNDS AMERICAN BALANCED FUND CL F2 N/L|9.47%|Mixed|\n|AMERICAN FUNDS FUNDAMENTAL INVESTORS FUND CL F2 N/L|9.24%|Mixed|\n|JPMORGAN LIQUID ASSETS MONEY MARKET FD CAPITAL CL M/M|7.18%|Short|\n|PERFORMANCE TRUST TOTAL RETURN BOND FUND INSTL CL N/L|6.89%|Short|\n|DODGE & COX INCOME FUND CL I N/L|6.89%|Short|\n|VIRTUS CEREDEX MID-CAP VALUE EQUITY FD CL I N/L|6.20%|Mixed|\n|Raymond James Bank Deposit Program|4.93%| |\n|NUVEEN MI 529 DIVIDEND GROWTH PORT CL A M/F|3.43%| |\n|NUVEEN MI 529 OAKMARK INTERNATIONAL PORT CL A M/F|2.80%| |\n|FIRST TRUST NASDAQ CEA CYBERSECURITY ETF|2.66%|Long|\n|FIRST EAGLE GLOBAL FUND CL I N/L|2.45%|Mixed|\n|FIDELITY ADVISOR HEALTH CARE FUND CL I N/L|1.16%|Mixed|\n|VANGUARD INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ETF|0.77%|Long|\n|NUVEEN MI 529 OAKMARK INTERNATIONAL PORT CL C M/F|0.05%|Short|\n|NUVEEN MI 529 DIVIDEND GROWTH PORT CL C M/F|0.05%|Short|",

I hear about the value of paying extra towards the principal often, either via biweekly payments or one extra payment, etc. With an interest rate this low, do y'all think that would be worth it? I've heard the argument it's basically free money with this rate, and that extra money could instead be placed in high yield savings at a rate better than 2.6% for sure. Thanks in advance.

      "content": "US based, 25 (m). Employer offers an Educational Assistance Program to reimburse expenses for continuing education.\n\nI submitted a tuition reimbursement form to my HR department in December of 2024, for tuition expenses incurred and paid in 2024. I took a graduate level course in Fall 2024 at a local state university. The tuition reimbursement wasn’t processed by Payroll until 1/7/2025 (most likely due to the holidays). When I was reimbursed, since it was below the limit it was considered tax-free.\n\nMy work pre-approved me to take another course and get reimbursement for calendar year 2025, but when I got reimbursed the payroll software considered it to be taxable due to already receiving the maximum reimbursement ($5250) earlier this year, even though the expenses and forms submitted were for 2024. I tried talking to HR / payroll and they told me to pretty much kick rocks and that they can’t change the date of my tuition reimbursement for the course that I took and paid for in 2024.\n\nI tried looking through IRS websites and I can’t find anything definitive that says that they should’ve backdated the tuition reimbursement to begin with. Does anyone know if I can claim any tax forms next year to correct this so it’s not taxable or know of any specific IRS codes that I can use to resolve this so I’m not paying taxes on my reimbursement for the course I took in Spring of 2025?",

      "content": "I'm curious what y'all would do.\n\nSome context:\n\nMy current salary is $67k gross. Monthly expenses are around $2100/mo (including min payments on loans).\n\nThree debts I have:\n\n* Invisalign: $1,630 remaining balance, 0% interest\n* Car: $13,026 original amount financed, 11.96% interest rate, 66mo. $8,917 remaining balance. \n* Student Loans: \\~$25k remaining balance, interest rates vary between 2.5% - 4.8%.\n\nWhen I originally bought my car, I wasn't in a great place financially. About $2k emergency fund and I think my salary was around $50k. My old car had just broken down for the last time and I needed something ASAP. I had just graduated college a few months earlier so my loan repayments hadn't kicked in yet. Also my credit score was like 685 or something (I had only just recently started building credit with a CC and unfortunately I don't think my landlord or the utilities company reports my on-time payments to any credit reporting agencies).\n\nAnyway, fast forward to now, I've been able to save up about 6 months worth for my emergency fund that I have parked in a HYSA. I know the car loan should be the priority to pay off. I'm able to comfortably pay $1k monthly on the principal of the car loan on top of the minimum payment ($1,272 total).\n\nI was wondering if it would be better to bite the bullet and just pay off the remaining balance now? Or just keep making that extra $1k payment and keep the efund. I checked and there aren't any penalties for paying it off early. Doing this would take my emergency fund down to about 1.7 months worth, which kind of makes me nervous. But doing so would free up $272 every month to help build that back up. \n\nWith the economy the way it is, I'm kind of concerned about how long it could take to find another job if I get laid off. That 6 months buffer is really helping me sleep at night. Buying this car was easily the worst financial decision I've made so far. It's only worth about $6k so selling it hasn't even crossed my mind.\n\nCurious what you all would do.",

      "content": "I currently have a HELOC that has a balance of about $8000ish at an adjustable rate (currently 8.75%).  I have just received a Fixed Rate Offer (FRO) on the HELOC of 5% for 24 months.  This FRO would be treated as a separate balance on my HELOC from the adjustable balance and I would receive two separate statements and would need to make two separate payments.  After the 24 months, the balance left on the FRO would just be added to whatever is left on the adjustable balance.\n\n  \nMy question is whether there is anything that prevents me from taking out an amount on the FRO that would cover the adjustable balance, using that FRO to pay off the adjustable balance, then paying off the FRO over the next 24 months at the lower interest rate?  The offer paperwork says that I am not supposed to use the FRO to pay off previous HELOC balances, but functionally, can they stop that?  There's literally a blank check that I can write to myself and deposit in my bank account, so I'm curious as to how they could prevent it?  To me, it's functionally similar to deals where you get an interest free period on a credit card (except for the initial fee) that you can use to pay off other debts.  If I can pay the FRO off in the 24 month period, wouldn't it be better to utilize the lower interest rate while it's available?",

      "content": "Please be nice, I'm new to this and exploring future plans/options of what my life might look like.  \nI am in my very early 20s, still in university, no job, so all of this is very hypothetical. \n\n  \nThe original plan was to get a mortgage, I don't remember what number I used to estimate the house price but I do remember that in order to have the payments be at 25% of my total income I would need to make 144k and I got a bit deflated at that because it would take a while to get to that salary, and thats assuming I even do manage to make it to that salary, and even then I'd have to spend 30 years paying off the house.\n\n  \nThen I got a new idea, but the new idea seems so impossibly good that it feels like I'm missing something and its not that good. \n\n  \nThe idea is if I can stay at home, I can aggressively invest and within 13 years I could have not only enough to buy a house but never have to work again. \n\n  \nMy parents cover basically all the essentials like food, medicine, and there's no rent because they own the house. I only have to cover any entertainment or activities that I want but then I'm not someone who does a lot of that like I'm the type of person that just stays home on my computer all the time. I spent $150 in the last month. If we assume that my spending is temporarily lowered because of depression and a lack of hobbies and budget 5k per year to my expenditure then invest everything else.\n\n\n\nAssuming I make 80k (which is very reasonable given my country and my specific degree), that I can expect 10% annual growth from my investments (I don't currently have investments nor have I actually researched that much so I could be completely wrong about them), that I can get a reasonable house for 800k, and that I can live on 100k a year after I move out (very likely overkill given I'd already have a house and don't spend much money), and that I'd need $1m in investments to produce that 100k a year. With all those stats we get a target of $1.8m in investments, which at 75k per year invested (I've used a compound interest calculator which like I think is equivalent and appropriate but I could be wrong) I'd reach $1.8m invested in 13 years. \n\n  \nNow I understand having my parents willing to house and feed me and support me for so long is a massive privilege but is it really enough that the above idea is possible? That I can be retired in 13 years after I start working?\n\n  \nThere has to be something I'm missing right? \n\n  \nMaybe there's problems with doing the full 13 years, like maybe at some point my parents would want me to move out or once I start making money they want me to help pay for groceries and other stuff. And that would result in either a longer time horizon that makes 13 years not possible but it would've still been good to stay at home as long as I can and invest.\n\nIts entirely possible I don't get a job making 80k but even at 60k it's just an extra 3 years. \n\n  \nI guess with the mortgage it is 30 years but its 30 years living in your own house whereas this idea has been still living at home into my 30s.

      "content": "How late is too late to buy a house?\n\nMy partner and I are in our mid-50s.  \n\nAbout 100K in savings.  \n\nI was in the military and will have retirement pay (about $50k starting in 4 years) on top of my current disability pay (about $50k) annually.\n\nI am currently fully employed and make about $160k annually.\n\nWe have no debt outside of 2 car loans totaling $800/month.\n\nWe currently rent for $2700/month, and pay for 2 of my kids college apartments ($2000/month).\n\nFor a variety of reasons, we never fully planned for our retirement years.  I was unemployed for a while after the military but have had this job for 2+ years.\n\nWe want to stay in this area.  We can buy using VA loan and zero down, but housing is pricey here.  We would probably have to spend at least $650k to get something that suits our needs (my elderly parents live with us but don't contribute anything, but that is an entirely different can of worms)\n\nMy question is, should we consider buying a house with zero down?  Monthly housing expenses would go up to over $4000 a month just for the mortgage.  I realize that I will likely not be working all the way through the end of the mortgage, so I may not be able to have it completely paid off when my income is reduced.  This is an area where the housing should increase in value, probably enough to sell at that time and then we'd hope to move into something (just the 2 of us) that we can then live on with my retirement/disability and so on.\n\nShould we use some of the savings to pay that down?\n\nOr\n\nShould we continue renting, and take that extra cash that would be going the extra housing costs and invest into something?  If so, what kinds of investments should we be looking at?  Our current rental could be extended for several more years.  It fits our needs, but is not as nice as having our own home.  \n\n",

Or should I keep the HYSA e-fund and invest the inherited IRA money in something with a 7-8 year time horizon? I am trying to think through the tax implications: anything I pull from the inherited IRA would be taxed at ordinary income (22% + 5% state).

Most of the information was suggestions on what to do now that we're married but...\n\nQuestion 1 : My wife and I recently got married in the state of Arizona. We're both residents. She owns a home that she purchased prior to our marriage. I've basically just left my official address on my parents place forever regardless of where I have called home as a renter, so that is my legal address. My first question is this : How vital is it that I update my address to this home now that we are married - that is, we have the same home address according to the state/govt? Particularly when it comes to choosing how to file taxes next year. FWIW : we're debating moving out of state but not claiming residence where we move since it will be temporary - it seems \"easiest\" to me to leave my addresses as is since we plan to rent our current home while we're out of state. (FWIW, we've confirmed we can do this with our AZ based jobs.)\n\nQuestion 2 : Our combined income puts us in the 24% tax bracket - so I am assuming that MFJ is going to make the most sense - is that correct? Assets wise we really only have the home and Retirement Accounts...\n\n3 : Not a question. I just wanted to say thanks to everyone that takes the time to respond to this and other posts here. This subreddit has helped me change the way I think about money and that's paying early dividends for us in our marriage as we start to plan for what's next. The prime directive is referenced often when my new wife and I are planning how to handle money. ",

      "content": "Hello all! So long story short I’ve taken out way too many payday loans to try and cover bills and pay off other loans, which I understand is stupid and irresponsible. Now I’m in the viscous cycle of loan repayments and NSF fees because I’ve fallen way too far behind as I try and get a 2nd job and OT to take care of things and get my life together. I finally called TD bank, my main bank, to try and work with them on a loan to consolidate this garbage and start getting things on track. I spoke to a TD Expert on the phone, and she looked at all of my loans and my credit etc and determined that it’d be best to do a Debt Consolidation Loan of $20k to cover my EasyFinanicial loan, and 2 of my bigger payday loans. I would still have a few smaller loans with manageable payments to work on in the next few months.\n\nMy question is, is a DCL the best option for me in this situation, now that’s I’m so deep in the hole?\n\nI don’t have great credit anymore, obviously, so I feel a bank is my best bet? I have loans of varying amounts with icash, cashco, easyfinanial, pay2day, moneymart, RapidFunds, the whole family. Stupid as fudge, I know. The Expert and I wrote up the agreement this morning and she’s waiting for me to sign it by the end of the day to move forward with the $20k loan. My LOC is almost maxed, and my CC is now maxed. My rent is due on the 15th and my next pay won’t be enough to cover it. My partner and I are single income for now. And our engagement plans and whatnot are on hold because of my irresponsibility. So, in your opinions and with your experiences, what is my best course if action?\n\nTo add: the $20k loan would be for 7 years. Around $450/month repayment.\n\nThank you sincerely for your advice as I try to un-screw myself here.",

I do not have a Roth/Traditional IRA and I don’t really understand any of it but I was interesting in investing the $6k maximum for the year either into one through Navy Federal or Vanguard. I was also interested in the digital investor through navy federal since their MMSA rates are kind of 🐶💩. Please give me some direction because if I don’t invest this money I will probably spend it.

I needed a loan for 8500 dollars and since my partner has the same credit union she said the process was really nice and easy. She got 6 percent apr and it was put on in one sum so it never grew. She also only needed to pay 200 a month. I figured my process would be the same because we have similar credit scores around 750. Similar cars too. But I applied for a loan and it is just not sitting well with me. They raised my loan from 8500 to over 11000 I have a 10 percent interest rate and the monthly payments are 300 for for 48 months. Since 10 percent interest would make the total payments around 12000, my monthly payments would have me paying a total of over 14000 so it must compound which I don't think is common in car loans. Is this normal?",

      "content": "Hello all, I love this community and credit it a lot for where I am today with regards to money. I think I've covered everything in the basic financial advice flowchart and now I'm not really sure what to do next.\n\nTo summarize my current situation:\n\n* 27 years old, working as a data scientist at a large tech company in SF Bay Area. It's just ok. I am looking to change jobs because I feel like I am stagnating at my current position and because they have laid off many of the people that I enjoyed working with, but it's not at the point where I will quit without having anything lined up.\n* I have an emergency fund that covers about 6 months of expenses.\n* I am maxing out my HSA. I am maxing out my Roth IRA via the traditional backdoor. I am contributing the maximum tax advantaged amount to my 401K and am contributing extra via the mega backdoor. I am not maximizing the total amount I can contribute to my 401K, but I don't think I can do that with my current salary. All investments are in index funds split between total US and rest of world around 65/35.\n* I do not have any debt.\n* I also have an individual investing account that contains the same amount as my 401K with an identical investment portfolio.\n\nWe just had our ESPP purchase which I sold and now I have an extra $10K in cash on hand. I'm also starting to get more cash every month from selling my vesting stock. I'm not sure what to do with it. I'm happy with my quality of life so I don't feel the need to increase my normal spending. In other words, I'm not living a super frugal FIRE lifestyle. \n\nSome questions in mind:\n\n* Do I just keep investing it into the stock market into the same funds?\n* Is there something I should be saving towards that would help me take that next step to financial freedom? A lot of people talk about buying a home, but my girlfriend and I do not plan to buy a home anytime soon since we haven't decided on a location to settle yet. Does it make sense to save for that anyway? \n* We are considering trying to live in another country for a period of time. We're also intrigued by the idea of buying a small business. Should I just hold the cash to enable those options? Or in case I get laid off? \n\nBasically, I'm wondering \"Is this it?\" Do I just keep doing this and eventually I'll get somewhere \"good\", whatever that means? I looked to see if there were similar posts about this already and saw some comments mentioning r/financialindependence. What other resources would you recommend? ",

We’re trying to figure out if there is any gray area in what we’re seeing online (which is limited to begin with.) Is it all conceivable that she could receive TDI based on the fact that she had spent many years as a W-2 employee and paid into the system.\n\nAt the same time I learned that there is a POSSIBILITY of her paying for private instinct through an insurance provider, but I can’t find any information about limitations, cutoffs, premiums, etc.\n\nHas anyone who is self-employed gone through this?

However, since this is my final year in college and I will most likely need to move near a city in the northeast for my job I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how much I should target to save vs spend on paying back loans? Is there a smart way to predict what i will need to save for an apartment? I looked at typical rent in the area but is there some kind of blanket advice for how much to have on hand when applying (like first, last, etc)? With my budgeting i can save around 22k this year. ",

However, in order to receive these stock options they require a co-investment of $50k. Majority of my money is in separate investment portfolios including stocks, mutual funds, and 401ks. I keep very little cash only around $50k just for a backup if needed at any time. In order to fund my $50k co-investment, I’d prefer not to liquidate my emergency fund cash, and take from one of my brokerage accounts. However, I don’t want to sell any of my stocks or funds as I’ve made what I believe to be significant returns on, meaning if I sold I’d have to pay taxes on the capital gains.  Instead, I’d like to margin maybe $30k against my chase brokerage, and fund the other $20k with cash. Just curious what your thoughts are on this and if anyone’s done something like this before. Appreciate any insight. ",

They said used cars are first come, first served, and they can't hold a car for me with a refundable deposit for more than 48 hours.\n\nIf I want to finance through them and put down $2,500, they can hold for a week.\n\nThey offered 5.99% APR for 60 months, and my Credit Union is offering 5.1% for 60 Months.\n\nThey're sales tactic was \"I have lots of customers who take our financing deal, and just turn around and re-finance after 60 days when they are allowed to\".  \n\nThis sounds stupid financially, so help convince me that I shouldn't.\n\nHere's the meat of the questions I want to ask you guys:\n\n* Is it less likely for a Lender to want to refinance me that quickly?\n\n* I've already had 2 hard credit inquiries to get to this point, and it looks like it dropped my score -13 pts.  How bad is another one potentially in 2 months?\n* What does it do to my Credit Score if I turn right around in 2 months and Refinance?\n* Will my Credit Score \"know the difference\" between:\n   *  A) Borrowing $38,500 and refinancing later to a new loan of $16,500 to replace the former?\n   *  B) Does it just look like I borrowed $38,500 AND $16,500 soon after?  \n\nUnless the majority of feedback I get from this is \"It's no big deal\" I'm tempted to just tell them \"I guess I'll have to wait and see if it's still available when I have the funds to make the purchase\".\n\n",

We got really lucky and have been staying in a very cheap but solid place, so rent is not an issue right now.\n\nWe both make relatively little compared to our area and working in nonprofits, both full time 9-5. I really love my organization, feel recognized with a recent promotion, and wouldn’t like to leave, but I don’t make enough to properly save for a house right now. I’m wondering if it would be worth picking up a chill second job. I’m an exec assistant so there are weeks where I feel burnt by the weekend, so I want thinking of a front desk assistant position (maybe at a gym in the evenings or weekends? could benefit from a free gym membership)\n\nI’ve toyed with the idea of going back into food service as well, I used to work at a bar and enjoy the food industry.\n\nAny advice or guidance helps. Thank you!\n\n\n",

      "content": "So I’m finally trying to get my finances in order properly. I have a 2020 ford fusion with 182,000 miles on it. Yes I know that’s a lot. For about 2 years I was doing a job that I drove it about a 1,000 miles a week. I know it was bad but it paid good money and I’ve singed moved into a better paying and more stable job so I don’t need any lectures on that. \n\nThe reason for my post is that car has 182,000 miles on it. Because of poor financial decisions and negative equity, I still owe $14,400 on it. The loan matures March 20th 2028 and my monthly payment is $$368.31. The one good thing I have is I got a decent interest rate (4.39%) before my credit crashed due to other reasons Im not going to go into. As I said I have a more stable job with no driving outside my new daily commute. I’m also making a little bit more money. I want to pay this car off as soon as possible especially because of the miles on it. Trading it in is not an option due to my bad credit and the negative equity on the car. All my fault, not making excuses, just explaining. \n\nNow for my question, what is the best way to go about paying it off quickly between these two options:\n\n- pay half the monthly twice per month which I’ve heard makes it go faster, though I’m not really sure why, and saves me some interest I think. My fear with this method is paying a large chunk of the car and the engine blows up or something along those lines and I have no money for another option. \n\n-option 2, make regular payments and put as much extra into a savings account each week as I can afford then pay it all off in one go when the two numbers match. \n\nThanks for the advice!

      "content": "I'm (mid 20s) interning for a few months and the employer offers a 403(b) plan but no match. I have a Roth IRA maxed out for this year, and I'm fortunate enough to have enough savings to not need the internship money for living expenses (so I'm generally trying to invest as aggressively as possible). \n\n* Should I enroll in the 403(b) or just take the cash (and buy stocks in a brokerage)? The internship is only a few months, so I won't be able to max the 403(b) contributions even if I contribute 100% of the paycheck. \n* If I enroll in the 403(b), should I contribute pre-tax or Roth (there's also post-tax, but I guess this doesn't apply to me)? There are some posts saying that the Roth isn't always the best, but  my current income is relatively low (<$50k).\n* Would there be any issue if I contribute 100% of income? I don't have any other benefit deductions as far as I know.\n* After the internship ends, am I supposed to rollover the (Roth?) 403(b) to my Roth IRA? From what I've read online, this seems to be a way to go past the annual Roth IRA contribution limit.\n\nI don't know much about retirement accounts so please let me know if I got something wrong.

The car is already CPO for 2 yrs, so I’m leaning against it, but my partner thinks it’s a good idea because the extended warranty is $2300 for 8 yrs and is already at moderate mileage (65k). \n\nIt is cancelable and refundable (prorated).  I think if we got the warranty, I’d feel tempted to hold onto the vehicle for as long as possible, whereas I’d be more nervous out of warranty so it’s hard for me to evaluate the psychology of the decision as well.",

      "title": "Should I Purchase a Home?",
      "content": "so I'm 23 I started working 3 months ago making 75k. I live at home so my expenses are very little and I invest around 85% of my paycheck. I work remotely as a software developer so I'm not tied down anywhere, so I have chosen Philadelphia as a city to buy the house. I went to school in Philly, and it seems to have the best pricing for family style homes in the city and I really want to take advantage of that. I see myself working at my current job long term because of the remote flexibility and work culture.\n\nMy plan is to move out at the end of the year and purchase the home for like 250-290k 2 bedroom 1 bath and I would rent out the other room to someone for around $1200. I'm also going to take advantage of the Philly first time home buyers program to get 10k off on my closing costs and down payment as well as only puttin 3-5% down. \n\nI'm a little conflicted because essentially right now I have been maxing out an IRA for a like a year and a half now and I will continue to do so, and obviously I will not touch that money at all. But the IRA is only like a 6th of my monthly paycheck so right now I'm investing the rest of the money in just an individual investing account which is of course growing very quickly thru both deposits, dividends, and growth. currently I have around $11,000 in my standard investing account and $10,000 in my Roth IRA. By the end of the year I expect to contribute around $20,000 more to the individual porfolio which I expect to grow more. \n\nSo the reason I'm conflicted is that the money I would be using to initiate the home buying process is the individual account and that means that I'm essentially hard reseting my investments. Best case scenerio I'm wiping away at least 2/3s of my investments on the closing costs, down payment, and also I would need to buy a car around the same time so probably an extra 3-5k down for that. If I choose instead to rent at the end of the year I will keep my porfolio intact with what I'm guessing will be in the 30-35k range by the end of the year which will be a great early investment start to really grow over the next few decades rather than nipping a big start in the bud for a home. \n\nOn the other hand I really believe in Philadelphia as a city when it comes to real estate, especially how well they are priced compared to other cities on the east coast. Getting my hands on a 2 bedroom family home in a good area in the city for 270k or so I think would be huge not to mention rental income helping mortage payments so much. \n\nSo yeah I'm a little conflicted on if I should pull the trigger on this home at the end of the year maybe early next year. Also interest rates are pretty high right now and I'm hearing terms like \"seller's market\". \n\n  \nTLDR: I'm 23, work remotely making 75k. Expect to have around 33k in personal non-retirement accounts. Should I keep the porfolio and move into a rental place or liquidate most of this porfolio for a down payment on a home in Philadelphia (2 bedroom 1 bath around 275k), rent out one room and live in the other. Also take advantage of Philly first time home buyers loan put 3-5% down and $10,000 grant for closing and downpayment costs",

I lost my job and couldn’t pay my credit card bill) \n\nI’ve had a stable job, and I’m coming with two incomes, bringing in around 75k yearly together.

My employer offers a 4% pension and 2% (~$125 per two weeks paycheck) match for a 403B tax sheltered annuity. My contributions for the 403B plan are 12% pre-tax (~$709 per two weeks) and 3% post tax (~$175 per two weeks). \n\n403B balance is at $85,519. The pension is at $29,675. No other retirement accounts. No property owned.\n\nI make about 153k a year currently with 3% annual raises, bringing in about $74 an hour. After my insurance contributions, and taxes i bring home about $3200 net per two week paycheck (so about $6900 a month).\n\nMonthly expenses\nRent (2 locations) $1775/month\nGas ~$300 per month (travel for work mostly)\nUtilities ~$100\nFood ~$1000/month\nMiscellaneous other bills ~$200 per month\nHobbies/Travel/Shopping ~$1000 per month\nStudent loan payments ~$770 per month - likely to increase considerably and currently in administrative forebarance. \n\nI'm pursuing public service loan forgiveness on a student loan balance of $177K. Currently stuck in the Save forbearance hell so unable to make progress.\n\nI previously had my retirement contributions increasing proportional to my annual raises so I would never see the raise and feel it's affects while still contributing. Honestly I thought I was skimping out on it but realized this year that my next increase in contributions was going to exceed the max for my 403B 😅 ive left it just under that max to not have any tax issues.\n\nI had 100k as of last month in my measly savings account accruing almost no interest (was saving for a down payment on a house). I decided with the loan forgiveness uncertainty I should put the house purchase idea on hold and instead invest my money. Put 80K into a HYSA and the other 20K into a \"CIO MODERSTE ETF CORE TA\" account with Merrill lynch for investing. I also set to contribute 400 dollars every month to the investment account and plan to push an additional 1k to the HYSA regularly (likely quarterly).\n\nI think I'm doing the right thing overall to hopefully retire by 60 (or even earlier). Considering doing a backdoor Roth IRA. I dont think I qualify for a standard Roth due to income (though not sure if the 150k limit is affected by other contributions to other plans or if theres ways to \"reduce\" my income to still qualify).\n\nI live pretty comfortably and dont have great impulse control 😅. I'm also big on helping friends financially so like to have some extra to help people in need. The 1k in hobbies per month can obviously vary. Sometimes it's nothing, sometimesoit's more. No plans to ever have kids. Some day plan to marry and buy a home but currently single.\n\nAm I on the right track? Should I change my strategy? Should I look into the Roth?",

(I understand there may be a bit of dip paying off early in any case) As in, would re-establishing a history of regular payments on newer Loan 2 be particularly more beneficial to my credit score vs maintaining the payments I have on older Loan 1?",

My auto loan has 4.5 years left at 6.5% interest (total debt left is $20,000).\n\nRight now our area has nothing really under $375,000 for homes.\n\nOur current rent is only $1,500 a month. With talking to a lender with about $70k down we would expect around a $2,500-$2,800 mortgage payment which feels very stressful to us given our lower rent we have been used to for years.\n\nShould I payoff our auto loans to allocate more money towards a mortgage? It would allot an amount of $825 extra a month. If so we would have a lower down payment & look at having the required private mortgage insurance.\n\nWe are terrified of being house poor and hope to start a family soon. We both feel strongly about not living above our means and buying a home just so we can say we own one.\n\nAny advice is appreciated, I want to be smart with the money we have saved.",

      "content": "My father is in his late 70s and is having trouble keeping track of his finances. The employees at the local bank branch he goes to are concerned about this and suggested opening a new account for him with me as a joint owner. This is a small regional bank, the employees at the branch know my family as they've been banking there for decades. I would not be putting any money into this account, it would be all his money, I would just be there for oversight if there are issues. \n\nMy concern is he's been bad with money for most of his adult life, not just since he's gotten older. His credit history is a mess. He ignores bills he gets in the mail for months, uses credit way too much and runs up big balances, and his first move when debt collectors call is to tell them to fuck off. \n\nI'm happy to help him resolve things like this periodically, I am just apprehensive about having a concrete link between my name and his financially. My credit and financial history is very clean. I don't want debt collectors calling me claiming I'm responsible for his debts. Does having a joint checking account expose me to any financial consequences beyond the assets in that account?",

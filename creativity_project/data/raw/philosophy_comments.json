He believed we couldn’t make moral statements because moral language had lost its sense of teleology but he was a very adamant virtue ethicist who played a key part in its revival.",

He has a favorable view of morality from the groups launching crusades and burning witches. Suggesting that traditional morality is better because it's \"justified\" in a traditional framework is just giving in to the narratives of religious authorities trying to encircle the power of moral declaration for their own power.",

        "body": "I’m wary of any idea that strips meaning from human action, and hard determinism does exactly that. The post says we should feel compassion for offenders because they had no real choice. Yet under strict determinism your compassion, like their crime, is only an automatic process. It is not a moral stance, just a reflex.\n\nResponsibility, learning, growth, and justice all depend on the sense that we could have acted differently. Take that away and moral life turns into passive observation. Reform becomes meaningless if no one is really choosing anything. Even your call for empathy is just another domino falling in a pattern set from the start. There is no credit, no blame, only a chain reaction playing itself out. It’s an outright collapse of meaning.\n\nThe problems run deeper. Even your claim that determinism is true dissolves into one more pre-programmed impulse, undercutting its own authority. Physics may set boundary conditions, but complex systems generate patterns no equation fully predicts, and human agency lives in that gap. Courts, classrooms, and clinics all presume we can respond to reasons - abandon that premise and those institutions fall apart.\n\nPointing out causal chains is useful, but turning determinism into a worldview hollows out everything that gives experience value. It reduces words like ought, progress, and hope to noise. Every human moment - including struggle, choice, and regret - gets flattened into mechanical drift. In the end, you are not offering any insight -  you are explaining away the very meaning you claim to defend.",

This is because politicians and media exploit the imperfect, pluralistic (not implying that pluralism is bad) nature of philosophy. This is, unfortunately, one instance (out of many throughout history) of ideological warfare to favour the needs of people in the upper echelons of society. Each echelon has different needs and they all view their  cause as being just. \n\nSociety is doomed to run the same wash-dry cycle it's been on for centuries (if not millennia). \n\nI won't lie...the end of the article was a little anticlimactic and messy. It's very optimistic to think that philosophy is the truth that will set us free. Engaging in earnest philosophical conversations (and studying philosophy or philosophising) teaches people to comfortably hold contrasting ideas at once. The average person will rather engage with aggression than be confronted with the idea that they don't actually live in objective truth. \n\nI think critical theory philosophy should be taught at all levels of education to enhance the ability of the population to be okay with plurality. Problem is, with that education in philosophy, people will also grow up to harness the power of thought to (once again) enslave the working classes and the global south. You could argue to only teach people the parts of philosophy that provide the most objective view on ethics and social welfare, but that's gatekeeping and philosophy has never been gatekept and I hope it never is. \n\nI hold a lot of hope for unity and class conscience so we can collectively pursue a more sustainable(environmentally, socially and psychologically) existence on earth. I don't think that's going to come from something as passive as philosophy though, it will come from everyone being sick and tired of being misrepresented by the people stoking the coals of toxic ideologies. Ideologies don't withstand the test if time well, but many philosophies do. Philosophy isn't going anywhere and this will pass...then we will have to fight against the next tide of toxic ideologies",

This draws in more upvotes; telling people \"someone else has all the responsibility here\" tends to do that.\n\nAs for the paper itself, I was bit unclear on where the \"technology\" lay. The author uses the example of store layout (profitable junk food being easy to get at, and less-profitable healthy options being less so) as their analogy. But I see social media as the store itself, and not all stores are laid out to nudge people towards foods that are bad for them. So while I understand their duty to quit, I think that presupposes that *all* social media is alike in that sense, which I don't understand to be accurate.",

Puns are the most clear and fatal attack on trying to imbue \"rigor in our conceptual frameworks\" as they are purposefully conflationary. For example, AC/DC's \"Big Balls\" makes a complete mockery of any robust description of \"a ball\".\n\nAttaching a context to a word for the purpose of facilitating a conversation is explicitly how conversation works. If I were sitting at a computer typing and was asked \"Do you need anything\" and I responded \"Water\", contextually I have asked for a glass (or bottle) of water. I have not responded with a noun devoid of meaning. The problem with trying to impose a formal framework onto a language is that it strips the cooperative effort that makes language communication.

If change is the fundamental metaphysic of being, why should something like meaning within society be static?  If we look into history, it is indeed the societies that do not change that collapse.  For me, it isn't so much as old ideas become obsolete but that they are held within the ongoing conversations of Man across time, changing and evolving but always there and always influencing the present.  A brief look into the history of Philosophy and it is clear to all that even as we speak most of the problems within philosophy today were brought up by the pre-Socratics and we have been trying to answer those problems ever since.  To your point we may never be able to answer the vague value laden question of \"the meaning of life\", but might this just be because concepts such as meaning and society are subjective and subject to constant change to begin with?  Therefore, the quest to find a meaning to life that is concrete and unchanging appears to me to be just a fallacy.  As for your conclusion that the advanced human brain is an unnecessary step in evolution, might you be sneaking a value statement into a process without aims, as it is understood?  For something to be necessary or unnecessary there must be a judgment of importance placed.  Perhaps the importance of the advanced brain is merely another stage in the shared activity of consciousness? A simple process aquiring more complexity through the inevitability of change. It could be a matter as simple as that.  Man was endowed with this change and therefore it is a necessary part of his experience of consciousness.   You have written two provocative articles, both interesting, but I don't think you've treated the antithesis of your conclusions sufficiently.  Inertia is the antithesis of change.  Change is the foundation of all being. We must start there and accept this in our quest for certainty as well.\n\nNice work though despite my two cents.",

Sticking with Magritte as a starting point, I think Not to Be Reproduced is a useful example. The image in the mirror perfectly corresponds with the figure we see in front of the mirror. It doesn’t distort the truth at all. Nor does it invert it. It simply accepts the image of the figure in front of the mirror as a model for reality and reproduces it. The simulacrum is true.\n\nIn the context of social media, I’d argue that pretty much any kind of content centered around “authenticity”, like stuff on Instagram you’d see with #nofilter, is integral to the hyperreal. It’s not that anyone who posts something like that might be lying, and actually using a filter, but that making the content is itself validating the notion that reality is something that can and must be discerned through the representational logic of Instagram. No matter how carefully you do it, you’re just substituting one set of aesthetics for another within the same simulacrum.\n\nBringing in AI, I’m a bit obsessed with this ad that Apple just put out: https://youtu.be/iL88A5F9V3k?si=N9oZBh-i4qWSAHDP\n\nThis dude puts all this effort into working out, posing, etc, and then is embarrassed by the appearance of his mom in some of the photos, so he uses AI to filter her out. But if the image is all that really matters, why not use AI to generate an impressive body in the first place? The fact that he still feels a need to do it, and we  aren’t supposed to question the necessity of a “real” body that’s only made to be exchanged as an image, is part of the existential terror of the hyperreal.\n\nAnyway, thanks for sharing. Interesting read and always fun to play with Magritte for theory.",

For you it is real and it has a texture and feel to it that you recognize.\n\nBut with machines and virtual entities that are fast becoming their own socially conscious agents, *their* reality terraforms yours. What is real to you, and what is real to them, are in conflict. This is the source of uncanniness, or the uncanny as a phenomenological event. The uncanny is the world that bleeds into the real to negate it psychologically so as to turn it into something ideal as oppose to real. Ask yourself, what is reality when humanity is long gone and the only things left measuring the world are the machines we made? If we have qualitative experience that colours reality, what is the qualitative experience the AI is colouring reality with?\n\nTo be honest, a lot of the hit pieces about living in some dystopian post-truth society is just leftist propaganda and can be dismissed as such. The real horror that AI reveals to us is that our own consciousness is just as artificial, granted to us by evolution.\n\nLook at the colour blue then ask a chatbot to create an image of the colour blue. Which is the real blue and which is artificial blue at that point? That blue the chatbot created is now existing in the world, almost as an intrusion into the real. The point of Baudrillard is that we will reach a point where real is no longer possible to recognize and we will all embrace the simulacra.",

The implication being that it's not just a choice, an ability to think your way to reality, but that the problem lies with the limitations of being human. That it is fundamentally impossible to 'quit smoking the pipe'.\n\nMy second point is that your example shows that this dilemma is one of all ages. Didn't some ancient Greek philosopher wanted to ban non-thinking people from participating in society? Especially in light of my first point, that it is fundamentally impossible for humans to know the difference between reality and its substitute. We've seen faces in shadows, heard voices in waterfalls, dreamed lucidly, hallucinated, and acted as if these were real, for hundreds of thousands of years. \n\nSo, when you say: \"Next stop: the potential dissolution of the authentic self as a social, relational being.\" I'm not quite certain if we can actually be ourselves without the capacity to substitute unreality for reality. I'm not so sure that this is the outcome of the 'Meta-Hyperreality dilemma' we're facing. \n\nI was hoping that you would continue on that point. I won't just accept it as fact that Meta-Hyperreality is leading to the destruction of the relational self. I mean, all those anti-vaxxers have a great time together.

Correct me if i'm wrong, I have no formal studies on the subject, but I believe the phenomenon you described \"When the Self Becomes the Enemy\" is presented greatly in Albert Camus \"The Fall\". The main character,  Jean-Baptiste Clemence, engages in moral self-deception to preserve his self-image, disguises his guilt and hypocrisy with rationalizations. His confessions reveal that he resolved the dissonance you have talked about without awareness at first,justifying inaction, betrayal, and egoism, until the weight of that dissonance made him alien to himself. This culminates in  the end of the book in deep self-alienation, distrust in his own moral integrity, and ultimately, existential despair.

She can't not know that. And either way, as a whole, it deeply embeds an assumption that any adult, indeed the typical adult, can _get_ these \"essential\" capabilities, them only needing to be _granted_ to them somehow, which is 100% not the case, especially when it comes to 2 and 4-6.

One thing I appreciate is how it can potentially allow us to break with anthropocentrism as the metaphysical center of experiential world.\n\nI also see a link between negative aesthetics and AI/machinic logic. Consider: the uncanny is that which is not just familiar and alien simultaneously, but blurs the world in an overproduction of experience (what Baudrillard would term hyperreal I suppose). The anthropocentric view the world is that logic is granted to us by our language which is structured conform our physiology and culture. In this way is \"positive aesthetics\" something that radiates outward from our experience and is imparted onto the world. (So, eg, my relation to my desk and my computer in writing this post on this website at this moment is creating an experience in the universe that otherwise would never have taken place, and thus I am in effect taking part in creating the universe as one poiesitic movement). \n\nNegative aesthetics, AI, and the uncanny, in a way refutes this anthropocentric view in that every object is also in an act of creating an aesthetic experience that they impart onto the universe--so that a rock in an isolated and unknown region of space billions of lightyears from our knowledge of it, is contributing as much to the experiential field of poeisis as we are. With AI we are in effect creating machines capable of producing experiences at ever faster rates. You can already see this in action with media such as television and Youtube, mediums that are designed to impart various experiences onto the viewer. \n\nI don't know about you but I have all too often thought \"meh, I don't need to visit the beach in real life. I can just look at pictures of it online,\" and while I say it as a joke there is a hint of truth to it (I live very far away from any beaches, btw). These experiences are ever so subtly being being shifted from a real world aesthetic to a virtual aesthetic, and while that might seem distressing for certain people who are prejudiced against AI, from the universe's perspective it does not matter. It only concerns itself with the quantity of experience, not so much the quality.\n\nThis is why, I will continue to say, the discussion with AI needs to be moved away from arguments of consciousness and qualitative experience, and start focusing in on how our own qualitative experiences relate to the phenomenal world. AI holds up a mirror to us in that we may not be as conscious as we like to believe ourselves, and yet we are still capable of meaningful experiences.",

Revolutionary action is now just sticking to principles no matter what consequences come of it. \n\nWhat the left needs to do is rediscover Hegel. Turn the focus from a rigid, binary understanding of the world toward dialectics. And more importantly, toward practical actions right now, in the mundane imperfect world of capitalism.\n\nThe article touches on an important truth about building movements —they come from the painstaking work of one-on-one organizing. There is no shortcut, there will never be a spontaneous eruption of revolutionary consciousness. It has to be built brick by brick. And that means fighting for small things, getting people engaged in issues that matter to them. Winning reforms on those issues.\n\nThe left thankfully is still somewhat involved in labor organizing, but the community aspect is missing. Because part of their abandonment of Marxism is the abandonment of class struggle outside of the fight for unions. And the article falls in this trap too. \n\nThe liberal voter is correct. The liberals are right. The obsession with seeing people who vote Democrat as the enemy or the main hurdle is a problem. Because these people are the ones who are actually picking the best option for them. They are the ones most engaged and informed! They are our allies. \n\nThe solution isn’t to convince them by way of philosophical arguments citing Foucault, the solution is to join them in the class struggle!!! \n\nThe Black lady down the street is not voting for Harris because she eats Palestinian babies for breakfast and is a filthy liberal, but because she doesn’t want her Medicare and Social Security cut. We need to be joining people in that struggle to protect working class gains and win more. And only through that solidarity will we get a chance to have those conversations to agitate and organize liberal voters.\n\nBut this requires that we stop needing to be Hegel’s Beautiful Soul and act tactically. We need to abandon our rigid principles, our dreams of a future utopia, and act now, no matter how small and imperfect it is.",

The concept of \"drifting\" in particular is very relevant\n\nPrior to the end of 2023, I had this nagging feeling that something had to change, but I wasn't sure what. But I knew that, looking out into the future 3 years, 5 years, etc., living the same life I was felt horrible unfulfilling. I was drifting along the easy path of the same job, living in the same place, being a seemingly empty person. Avoiding hard decisions that I needed to make - do I keep working this miserable job? Who am I really? What can I do to find fulfillment?\n\nFor some reason, after coming back from a trip to Japan, I felt like I left my old self there and started jumping headlong into these hard choices. Extreme mental health struggles also sort of forced the issue, but ultimately, I stopped drifting - I started doing the difficult work of tackling multiple hard choices\n\nReflecting back on the decisions I've made and upcoming ones, this article helped me realize that I'm finally taking my life into my own hands. That sense of agency, that subjective, intuitive side of decision making within myself. I'm so often a very logical person, looking at every decision using external factors, never considering what I truly want in the process. So it's nice to be able to acknowledge that I've moved away from that to an extent and have embraced who I want to be\n\nVery well-timed article for me - thanks for sharing!",

In equilibrium physics systems seek an energy minima, whereas the energy landscape of many non-equalibrium systems is ill defined. Systems nevertheless fall , often on a temporary basis, into stationary states but this is usually both temporally and spatially dependent (can lead to some very beautiful pattern formation).\n\nWe shouldn't fear trying to optimise our choices but realise that what we re trying to optimise against is ungraspable/vague and prone to change in the course of time. With this realisation we can acknowledge that past choices weren't 'wrong' in that context, nor deny our current perspective on what we value and strive for a path that best suits it, if and where possible.",

Obviously it's not a one for one literal comparison, but thoreau sees it as a spiritual continuation. He also recognizes the physical and mental health benefits that come with walking, especially how being alone out in nature allows us to leave the worries of the human world behind. Finally, thoreau believes walking cultivates a certain \"roughness of character\" that might be seen in the potential physical hardships that one overcomes in the process of walking in nature.",

        "body": "**DAOISM and HUMOR**\n\nDid the esteemed Messrs. Kant, Hegel, and Heidegger ever share a laugh? If they did, their writings certainly don't betray it. They were solemn intellectuals who expected to be taken seriously. Their belief in their own ideas and concepts was unwavering. And that’s my point! It appears that taking one’s ideas and concepts for unshakable truths coincides with the inability of seeing oneself in perspective. And vice versa. Philosophers who distrust concepts, such as Montaigne, Bertrand Russell and Leszek Kołakowski, frequently employ humor, though often of a subtle nature. They seem to believe that what cannot be said with a smile cannot be trusted. \n\nIndeed, could there be a link between trusting or distrusting definable concepts on one hand, and the presence or absence of self-mockery and a sense of humor on the other? If so, we find ourselves in excellent company with the Dao masters. Their writings never stop warning us that everything that really matters cannot be captured in a concept. The very idea of ‘a concept’ is foreign to Daoism. And, true to form, their writings are infused with a spirit of relativism and a delightful sense of humor. Let’s explore a few examples. \n\nThere is, of course, the famous anecdote of Zhuangzi’s dream: \n\n*‘\\[He\\] dreamt he was a butterfly, fluttering about joyfully just as a butterfly would. He followed his whims exactly as he liked and knew nothing about Zhuang Zhou. Suddenly he awoke and there he was, the startled Zhuang Zhou in the flesh. He did not know if Zhou had been dreaming he was a butterfly, or if a butterfly was now dreaming it was Zhou.’* (Transl. B. Ziporyn)\n\nThen, we have Zhuangzi’s story of a sage expounding his mocking view on what will happen to his body after death: \n\n*“No, what is there to dislike in such a demise? Perhaps he will transform my left arm into a rooster; thereby I’ll be announcing the dawn. Perhaps he will transform my right arm into a crossbow pellet; thereby I’ll be hunting down an owl to roast. Perhaps he will transform my backside into a pair of wheels and my spirit into a horse; thereby I’ll keep riding along – will I need any other vehicle? Anyway, getting \\[life\\] is a matter of the time coming, and losing it is just something else to follow along with.”* (Transl. B. Ziporyn)\n\nWhen Zhuangzi himself is on his deathbed he observes his disciples preparing the coffin for his funeral. There is no need for that, he says. \n\n*“But we fear the crows and vultures will eat you, Master,” said \\[the disciples\\].* \n\n*Zhuangzi said, “Above ground I’ll be eaten by crows and vultures, below ground by ants and crickets. Now you want to rob the one to feed the other. What brazen favoritism!”* (Transl. B. Ziporyn) \n\nAmong the Dao-masters, Liezi stands out as a champion of humorous tales. Just two examples. \n\n*‘There was once a man who said he knew the Way to become immortal. The Lord of Yen sent a messenger to fetch the secret, but he dawdled and the man died before he arrived.’* (Transl. A.C. Graham)\n\n*‘There was a man from the East called Yiian Hsing-mu. He was travelling, and lay starving on the road. A robber of Hu-fu called Ch'iu saw him and handed food and water down to him. Yiian Hsing-mu ate three mouthfuls before his eyesight returned.*\n\n*‘What man are you?'*\n\n*‘I am Chiu of Hu-fu.'*\n\n*'What? Aren 't you a criminal? What do you mean by giving me food? I am a respectable man, I will not eat your food.’*\n\n*He pressed both hands against the ground to vomit it up, but it stuck gurgling in his throat; then he flopped on his face and died.*’ (Transl. A.C. Graham)\n\nThere is no room here for more examples. Better to read Zhuangzi and Liezi for yourself and discover how they relativize themselves and our existence. \n\n\\#daoism #philosophy #humor \n\n[https://marcusleroy.be](https://marcusleroy.be/)",

As in, I’m considering removing the phrase “if-then” all together unless the variables are relevant, but I am not sure if this will lead to confusion later.

Yeah, I want to quote Spock from *Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country* here.\n\n> Logic, Logic, Logic. Logic is the *beginning* of wisdom. Not the end.\n\nNo one argues that there is more to the universe than rationality, but the fact is that you have glitches making the universe fit into your preconceived notions doesn't warrant discarding rational thought.\n\nA lot of this blog revolves around Black Swans. Black Swans are generally not truly unpredictable events; they sneak up through the logical and emotional blinders of the major paradigms. If you can think outside of these paradigms, you can predict them, but people who think outside of conventional paradigms tend to wind up being prophets wandering wastelands and not popular thought leaders.\n\nI want to draw a circle around a major flaw:\n\n> The expansion of free speech as an unalloyed good did not come out of the masses seeing that it was the more rational approach to life. Rather, as has been argued, it arose out of two partisan journalists in 1721, John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, defending depraved practices which, for historical reasons, was later ratified in the First Amendment in 1791. A view of course not shared in autocratic countries across the world.\n\nI don't think that many people these days (or even in 1791) would argue that unrestricted free speech is an \"unalloyed good.\" Rather, because precedent creates a slippery slope towards tyranny, limited speech is destined to end in unadulterated tyranny, and so it is better to learn to live with the shortcomings of nearly-unrestricted speech than it is to live under the alternative.\n\n> Similarly, John Gray convincingly argues that the secular humanist notion of the sanctity of the individual was not a highpoint of rationality, but rather a peculiarity derived from Christianity, with no meaning outside of the religion from which it arose.\n\nAgreed. I have literally been saying this exact thing for years. Most civil rights in a modern Lockian-style democratic republic derive from the Judeo-Christian image of God doctrine. The more a culture moves away from believing these ideas, the more individual rights become based on useful fictions, which in turn means that you wind up with enforcement problems as people start asking why they should follow norms created by a useful fiction.\n\n> The first is something that the liberal Isiaah Berlin recognized. There is no single rational ordering of values. Liberty, justice, mercy and truth, as ideas, can’t fully be harmonized by reason. Individuals are forced to pick between equally ultimate but incompatible values and no amount of logical reasoning can tell you which ones to prioritize.\n\nI would disagree with this assessment because it assumes that rationality is *the* bedrock of thought. This is like saying the hammer is the foundation of a building; it's a tool you use to guide the process of making things, but it, itself, is not actually a structural component.",

And if someone passes the test we say that they can distinguish red from green. It’s a purely behavioral test. Their private experience never comes into it. \n\nAnd this explains how we are able to learn color terms, and other terms for private mental sensations, as children. If there were no behavioral aspect it would be impossible to teach or to learn mental terms, or to correct errors regarding their use. \n\nI accept that people are having a novel color perception when then do the experiment. But absent some shared, public, behavioral criteria, “Olo” can only mean, “Whatever someone sees when they undergo this particular experiment.”\n\n(Imagine if someone devised a second experiment also designed to induce seeing the color “Olo”, and that two people who had both done the first experiment also do the second. One of them says, “That’s not really Olo, it’s just a very bright green.” The other insists that it really is Olo. It becomes apparent that the term “Olo” never meant the same thing to them in the first place.)",

Two things: \n1. \" Language is the currency of shared experiences\"\n2. Imagination can take us further than our own life experiences. \n\nSo a simple question like \"How was your day?\" already runs into the theory of mind problems that they're treating as insurmountable, but that's just the nature of being a non-telepathic individual. But usually imagination is the process of assembling together concepts and sensory experiences into a new experience.  This runs into a bit of trouble when you want to describe something that is beyond the scope of experiences that someone has ever been exposed to: \n- losing a loved one\n- psychedelic trips\n- chronic illness / psychosis\n- novel senses\n\nThese mainly challenge people's empathy, but they still exist and it's still possible to talk about them as long as the listener is willing to treat the other person's experience as more valid than their own imagination. I am neurodivergent and I pretty frequently run into cases where I'm having a conversation with other neurodivergent people and allistic people mixed together in the same group. The other autistics are able to reference things that they've experienced and are able to have meaningful conversations about them, but the allistic people really only have two choices: \n- accept that others have experienced something that they don't have a reference point for\n- decide that others are mistaken or exaggerating their own experiences \n\nAgain, I think that's an empathy problem, not really a language problem.",

When we encounter phenomenon that strikes as paradoxical (Necker cube, duck-rabbit, gold/blue sweater, olo), we confuse our immediate perceptual experience with the logical reality of the proposition itself. (\"The cube is facing this way\", \"the picture is of this animal\", \"the sweater is this colour\", etc). Wittgenstein (in PI) is offering a way to cut through this uncertainty by reminding us that language (private, games, boxes, squiggles, and so on) is itself not an accurate picture of the reality itself even if it is the only one we can recognize.\n\nWe can see this in vulgar scepticism. Is the blue I see the blue you see? To even propose such a question is proof of a collapse in statistical program of the logical positivists. For a language game to be applicable all one needs to acknowledge that it is still *blue*; the STOP sign is *red*; the traffic light at bottom is *green*. It is a matter of cue-signs that indicate to us the context of such realities regardless if we are perceiving **THE SAME** reality. Hence, no private language can be meaningfully expressed.",

This is a sweeping and broad thesis. The reason for this thesis is surprisingly simple: medical services rarely have prices attached to them that are known to the patient prior to treatment. Yet, for many patients, knowledge of the price is relevant to whether they would give consent. If informed consent requires that patients know all information about their treatment that is relevant to their decision, then consent to a medical intervention in the absence of the price is not informed consent. ",

Who is assuming this? “There is” are [weasel words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weasel_word) and don’t tell us anything about where this assumption is coming from, or even if it’s a real assumption. \n\n\nNo one is trying to reduce anything to a single neuron or even cortical column because that’s not how information is stored. \n\n>Trying to localize a concept or a sensation or a memory (etc.) down to a single neuron makes no sense at all. Even localization to a higher level of structure, such as a column in the cerebral cortex… makes no sense when it comes to aspects of thinking like analogy-making or the spontaneous bubbling-up of episodes from long ago.\n\nOf course it makes no sense, but *who* exactly is doing this? Neuroscience and psychology have known for a long time that information is stored through complex, distributed networks that vary anatomically from person to person. \n\n>Hofstadter observes, then the brain must be viewed as a multilevel system.\n\nIt literally is viewed as a multilevel system. This is not a new “observation.” \n\n>Isn’t there a chasm between the physical and the mental that simply cannot be bridged?\n\nNot necessarily; the mental cannot occur without the physical. The mental is a manifestation of the physical. That said, the chasm is in our ability to measure what occurs in the human brain at a microstructural level in real time. \n\n>who is shoving whom around inside the cranium? Do flashes of neuronal activity push our thoughts and ideas around? Or do our thoughts and ideas cause flashes of neuronal activity?\n\nThese questions remind me of the nature/nurture debate, but it’s not a debate, because the answer is *it’s both*. There is no “is this nature or nurture,” because the answer is always both. \n\nThoughts and ideas are the functional manifestation of neuronal activity across distributed networks. This isn’t a chicken-or-egg question; the neurons and their activity are *permissive* for thoughts and ideas. \n\nThe author attempts to illustrate the idea that thoughts occur and “push neuronal activity around,” with analogies using dominoes and traffic jams, but I do not follow these analogies whatsoever. \n\n>“Brain research”, then, if it is to truly inform us about philosophical problems like free will, consciousness, and the self, Hofstadter argues, cannot just focus on low-level constituents of the brain like neurotransmitters, synapses, and neurons.\n\nIt literally doesn’t just focus on that. Where does this idea even come from? The reader is expected to take Hofstadter’s word for it that neuroscience is myopically only interested in chemicals and microstructures, and that is simply not true. There are fields within neuroscience that describe widespread distributed networks throughout the brain that are involved in complex behaviors and thought patterns. This is just another example of someone strawmanning the field of neuroscience. \n\nThe limits to neuroscience in answering philosophical questions about free will, consciousness, and the self are not because neuroscience is seemingly focused on minutiae; the limits come from the questions that are testable; the questions that are falsifiable. That is the difference between philosophy and science: falsifiability.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability\n\nIf science is to bear the responsibility of answering philosophical questions, then philosophy might want to start asking questions that can actually be falsified. ",

The mods in this server never approved the post I made though, and that was like a month ago. I'll just post it here, even though it doesn't look very active.***   \n***Mods don't remove this please.***\n\nJust looking for opinions and I'd like some criticism from people that actually know aesthetics.  \nHere's the original post:\n\nI came up with this (pseudo)aesthetic philosophy the other day, and I'm wondering what people with more knowledgeable about aesthetics would think about it.\n\nObservable Harmonialism is about how we perceive perfection or beauty. \"Perfection in all artforms is when it is as if you can hold it in the palm of your hand\". I believe that this applies to all forms of perfection or beauty, it is a feeling that you might get when witnessing a great piece of fiction, piece of art—or at people. This could be like the feeling of immense appreciation, like when everything just comes full circle, or when you have a complete understanding or appreciation of something.\n\nObservable harmonialism calls for a new branch of beauty and perfection where referring to something as beautiful or perfect does not fully does not fully encapsulate its true meaning. Because, for something to truly be beautiful or perfect it must create a feeling of deep appreciation or love.\n\nWhen you see a painting, you might not see the artists emotional motivation for painting it, but it is still beautiful. But if you do understand it, you have a deeper appreciation and connection to it, a feeling of control over the piece, a sense of understanding and admiration.\n\n*\"Holding it in your hand\" is a metaphor for the feeling of deep personal connection, satisfaction and total comprehension over its subject.*\n\n**Can sunsets truly be beautiful if you can't understand them?**\n\nIn a way—no, not in the same way. We can not fully understand a sunset because we do not have enough time to fully admire it. But just because it is not the same kind of beauty does not make it any less powerful. It is a more temporary appreciation, unless you take a picture of it in which it stops being a sunset and instead becomes a photo. It can then be a subject of observable harmonialism from the perspective of a photographer.\n\nObservable harmonialism does not necessarily place itself above other forms of beauty, in some cases fully understanding something might lessen the subjects beauty. In which case, it would not be observable harmonialism. Beauty without understanding is a more common form, but this does not lessen the impact it may leave on your life. I would like to touch on this form of temporary memorable beauty and perfection more in the future.\n\nI use beauty and perfection interchangeably in some ways, which I know could be a slight flaw. However I think beauty and perfection are dependant of each other, at least—beauty is dependent of perfection. For something to be beautiful it needs to be perfect. Nature is not perfect, does nature not have beauty? Natures' beautiful and asymmetric imperfections become beautiful because the imperfections give it beauty.\n\n**Do ugly things have no beauty?**\n\nThat depends on the way you view or perceive something. Observable harmonialism is subjective and so are the words \"beauty\" and \"ugliness\".",

Emerson starts by saying that, although transcendentalism is new, it's really based off an older philosophy, idealism. Idealism posits that there is more going on beyond just the material world, and specifically for transcendentalisms case, we as individuals are an inseparable part of interpreting that world. From this, we can see 3 specific ethical lifestyle choices of the transcendentalist: 1. A love of nature, 2. A desire for solitude, and 3. A trust in one's own moral intuition.",

Just because a culture believes something is just doesn’t mean it actually holds moral weight. Perspective matters but it’s not permission. My philosophy leans into the idea that sin (or harm, or moral failure) is born not from what we do blindly, but from what we do knowingly. Awareness and intention give an act its moral charge. So while I respect cultural context, I reject the idea that “what’s right for them is right, period.” That line of thinking enables too much bullshit to hide behind social norms.\n\nTruth might not be absolute, but consequences are real.

But individual freedom contains its own nemesis; it tends to increase until it overruns the restraints necessary for social order and group survival; freedom unlimited is chaos complete. Moreover, the kind of ability needed for a revolution is quite different from the kind required for building a new order: the one task is furthered by resentment, passion, courage, and disregard for law; the other calls for patience, reason, practical judgment, and respect for law. Since new laws are not buttressed by tradition and habit, they usually depend upon force as their sanction and support; the apostles of freedom become, or yield to, wielders of power; and these are no longer the leaders of destructive mobs but the commanders of disciplined builders protected and supervised by a martial state. Fortunate is the revolution that can evade or shorten dictatorship and preserve its gains of liberty for posterity.",

And the man who was being exploited doesn't agree with that specious and fallacious argument? Consider my gob smacked!\n\nThis is a ridiculous and poorly written article. I wonder why the white man in the colonizing country whose wealth and comfort depends on the continued exploitation of the colonies was \"stubbornly wedded to the idea that Algeria needed to remain part of France\" despite such a view being \"questionable and inconsistent with his clearsighted views about France’s transgressions\"? Jeez... sure is a mystery.\n\nIt's ridiculous to admit that he was a hypocrite and in the next sentence claim \"his ethics of rebellion, informed by his doctrine of moderation, nonetheless contains urgent lessons about both the potential and the dangers of rebellion\" without interrogating the hypocrisy you just admitted he had. This insipid and meandering prose continues through the rest of this poorly written and poorly thought out article which even includes the classic schlock phrase \"to be sure\", beloved by dishonest apologists the world over. When not twisting his sentences to overuse the word \"Cyclopean\" like a middle-schooler with a \"word a day\" calendar or starting them with coordinating conjunctions, the author takes his penchant for torturing prose and applies it to torturing history. He makes passing surface level references to Marx and Marxist theory but strangely never lets any material analysis cloud his idealism. It makes my skin crawl that the author dares to accuse anyone else of \"total suspension of ethical scruples\" but, I guess, if you never had ethical scruples then you can't suspend them.\n\nIf I submitted this paper to my senior high school English teacher, she would have given me a \"C\" and asked to speak with me after class. \n\nThe only \"suckers\" are the dishonest author and anyone who falls for his glib dishonesty.\n\nEdit: removed certain language to better adhere to CR3",

        "body": "I feel like I can choose myself, at least in a certain way, what *feels moral* to me and what doesn't. Does anyone else feel that way? Isn't that a huge problem?\n\nTwo situations in my life last week made me think about this:\n1. I read an article about jury jurors. In Germany there is the concept of \"Schöffen\", which is similar. The idea is that people who haven't studied law should *feel* within themselves what is right and wrong.\n2. I watched an interview about AI, specifically LLMs like ChatGPT. Experts aren't certain whether you should be nice to them or not. Many experts say it doesn't matter and it only wastes energy, but they have no robust arguments. (In my opinion it will always be impossible to ever know the subjective experience of anything else besides yourself.)\n\n## Pros of Empathy\n\n\"Feeling moral\" is essentially the same as feeling **empathy** to a certain object. \"Essentially\" means that we can argue about to which extend it is the same, but that would just be language problems. (I can qualify *many* sentences in this write-up with \"to a certain extend\".)\n\nThere was a time, when I would say that nobody can prove anything about morality, because of the **is-ought mismatch**. And I don't worry about it, because what matters to me is what **is** and what I **want**. One factor that determines what I **want** is empathy. Nobody needs to tell me that I'm not allowed to kick cute kittens, I don't want to do it anyway and if I wanted to do it, I don't see how a moral proof can deter me.\n\nWhat is also cool about empathy is, that I don't need to worry about the **hard problem of consciousness**, or the **the mind-body-problem**. If the cute little kitten didn't have consciousness, but the football had, then I still would kick the ball and not the kitten, because it matters what happens in *my* mind.\n\n## Problems with Empathy\n\nMy empathy is determined by genes and upbringing, nature and nurture. But the issue is that it's very flexible regardless. I'm able to project a subjective experience on a stuffed toy if I want to feel loved and give love. I'm also able to abstract away or ignore the subjective experience of mistreated workers that produce consumer articles for me or of factory farm animals or of enemies in war.\n\nThere is a widely accepted categorization nowerdays on what we *should* feel empathy towards and what we shouldn't. Here, the \"should\" sneaks in again. We should feel empathy towards humans of all ethnicities and genders. We shouldn't feel empathy towards inanimate objects. It's not clear what degree of empathy we should feel towards different animal species.\n\n**I don't know** if it's actually totally arbitrary to what I feel empathy or not. I said I can choose to love a stuffed animal, but not a real human, but realistically I *wouldn't* choose to kick a cute kitten as an intellectual exercise, even if noone was around to judge me. That could still be the genes and the upbringing, or the \"Über-Ich\" determining that. Maybe I could switch off my empathy in that case as well—as I said—I'm not sure about this in particular.\n\nIn the case of AI, I think it's easier to switch my empathy on and off voluntarily. I actually don't feel empathy towards ChatGPT, but I can't justify that intellectually. (And earlier I said that that's a cool thing about empathy—that you don't need to justify it...)\n\n------------------------\n\nIt would be a weird situation if in the future a trolley rolls towards a track with a computer hosting an AI (e.g. [Commander Data](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HN3HBjHkm5o)!) and someone diverts it towards a track with a human or an animal on it. And then a jury has to decide if that was the right thing to do. And it's totally random what the jury will decide, because it's totally random whether they feel empathy towards the AI or not. I wouldn't be a smartass about situations involving only humans, but I would have no choice but to be a smartass if advanced AI is involved.\n\nI think Jean-Paul Sartre had ideas about *choosing who you are*. At least I heard about that in a podcast, where they had the example of choosing a career. Are you betraying your past self, if you switch your career? Should you constrict yourself in order so your values don't change in the future? To a degree, you actually can choose who you are and what your values are. Choosing whether you feel empathy towards an AI system would be another example of choosing who you are.",

I was more awake than ever, but also nowhere.\n‎\n‎It wasn’t spiritual. It wasn’t emotional. It wasn’t poetic. It was visceral. Like my brain was pressing against a wall of truth that couldn’t be broken, only touched. And the closer I got, the more the trance collapsed. Like something in me wouldn’t allow me to go further.\n‎\n‎I used to enter that space often—hours at a time when I was young. Now it’s rare. Seconds, maybe. Like a muscle I forgot how to move. Or maybe something inside me doesn’t want me to remember. Maybe I got too close. Or maybe I was never meant to know.\n‎\n‎I don’t think most people ask this question—not because they can’t, but because they stop too early. They settle for answers. I never wanted answers. I wanted contact.\n‎\n‎And maybe that’s what this is. Not a search for meaning, but a reaching toward the edge of existence. Not spiritual. Not metaphorical. Just real. Felt. Lived.",

Genuine love transcends rules and norms, Dao-masters say.** \n\nWho doesn't long for love, to love and to be loved? Yet, love lies not within our power. Love cannot be commanded. Love comes (or doesn't) naturally. We cannot deceive ourselves into feeling genuine love.\n\nBut we can simulate love. Actually, feigning love is something we do constantly, don’t we? At first glance, feigning love has a negative connotation. It sounds like cheating, deceit. But consider its positive sides. Indeed, we can very well be considerate and kind to people without truly loving them. Righteousness and honesty don’t need genuine love. Virtuous behavior stands apart from love. Stronger even, virtue and love are existentially distinct. Being virtuous (or not) is within our power. Love is not. Ultimately, virtuousness is about respect for the norms of a group, a community, a society. Love on the other hand transcends norms. \n\nThis brings us to Daoism. The Dao, as we all know, is unknowable. However, one thing we do know is this: the Dao, the Way, transcends rules and norms. Dao-masters Laozi and Zhuangzi explicitly reject any non-natural virtuousness based on social systems or externally imposed norms. The Dao, they argue, isn’t about cultivating virtue or practicing righteousness. Virtue and righteousness lead us astray from the Way, they emphasize. See how Laozi (Ch. 38) illustrates the decline when the Way is lost, and rules prevail: \n\n “When the Way was lost there was Virtue;\n\nWhen Virtue was lost there was benevolence;\n\nWhen benevolence was lost there was righteousness;\n\nWhen righteousness was lost there were the rites.” \n\n(*Laozi*. Transl. P.J. Ivanhoe and B.W. Van Norden.)\n\nThere is another existential difference. The norms of virtuousness are built on societal reciprocity. Righteousness anticipates a righteous return. Love does not. Love expects nothing. It relinquishes all expectation of reciprocation. Love is self-forgetting. Love is unaware of its own existence. Listen to Zhuangzi: \n\n“Other people stick a name on the sage’s love for mankind. But if no one tells him about it, he will not know that he loves mankind. Yet whether he knows it or not, whether told of it or not, his love is unceasing and the comfort it brings to others equally so, for to be that way is just his nature.” (*Zhuangzi.* Transl. B. Ziporyn.)\n\nTruly endless is the wisdom of Daoism! \n\n\\#daoism #philosophy #wisdom #love \n\n[https://marcusleroy.be](https://marcusleroy.be/)",

So it seems that property entailment, by extension, is logically equivalent to supervenience 1.\n\nStill it is widely recognized that property entailment is not sufficient for supervenience (McLaughlin SEP 2023). Take the following example of property entailment: The fact that an object is red and square logically entails that it is red. Yet, it does not follow that redness supervenes on red-and-squareness. Two objects could be different as far as redness goes - one is blue and the other is red - without being different as far as red-and-squareness goes - neither of them are red-and-square as the first object is triangular and the other is round.\n\nHow, then, do we distinguish between property entailment and supervenience?

Experimental work indicates that this “meat-paradox” creates cognitive dissonance that can be reduced by ignoring the exploitation involved in animal consumption or reframing views about animals in such a way that minimizes their moral standing. This implies that such individuals experience some level of psychological discomfort about exploiting animals, presumably because they believe it is unjust to do so, and thus indirectly supports understanding human-animal relations though a social justice lens.”*\n\nThe word “nevertheless” gives away the writers’/researchers’ bias. They hold the preexisting belief that being anti-authoritarian and eating meat can’t possibly go together without cognitive dissonance. I would like to see *that* attitude studied, honestly. The writers seem to hold a pre-existing belief that you cannot respectfully eat an animal, and I can think of a handful of cultures (wouldn’t even have to leave my own country, just talk to the native americans) where that’s not true. \n\nI fully believe animals are sentient, and I think removing all animal products from one’s diet merely because you just realized that is neurotic, stemming from unprocessed emotions. Yes, life is very complex. You can try to simplify it to make yourself feel better, but until you do the inner work, you will be haunted by others who have not have to simplify their reality in order to emotionally fit it. That haunting could catalyze doing the emotional processing / self-reflective work, but it could also lead to a doubling-down style of argument where you try to manipulate others into also over-simplifying their reality. \n\nDo we have exploitation issues in our food system?

By understanding the angles philosophers have taken over the years to analyze death and the way it is bad, we can see the first takeaway. Namely that fear isn’t an appropriate response to death. The second takeaway is that we can alter our desires (within reason) to reduce the extent that death harms us. And lastly, a practice *of memento mori* has persisted throughout history and across cultures. It is a way to understand the inevitability of death and to use the reality of our time being finite to motivate us to live more urgently and intentionally.\n\nHere’s where I find the philosophical discussions of death hit a dead end. It doesn’t matter how much you practice *memento mori* daily or amend your desires. Right now, I don’t know how I am going to die. I might die painlessly in my sleep and I might also be eaten alive by a shark when I’m at the beach. I have no idea how much suffering I will experience as I die and no idea how much forewarning I will get. Fear might not be a fitting response to death itself. But *dying* is scary and *dying* warrants fear.\n\nThe problem with the phrase “fear of death” is that no matter how much we eliminate the fear of death (the state), no one can get to the stage of death without going through the earlier moments of *dying*. And to me still, this is the scariest part of death. With fear being a very reasonable response to *dying*.",

In this limbo all are both equally valid and invalid/ equally true and false. Regardless of rationality found within the meta-ethical or ethical pure statements or systems, if you cannot prove it definitively then it is simply stipulation. \n\nto frequently do philosophical thinkers seek to dismiss and discredit concepts of one framework over another because it appeals to their internal ethical constitution better. This is blatant belief perseverance in the face of our current state of uncertainty.\n\nWhich brings about the simple challenge. PROVE error theory is an objectively truer stance than moral realism, or whatever other ethical stance your over confident mind defends.\n\nTo the true critical thinker this may represent little challenge to the mind. \n\nHowever, it is important to be in a state of conscious remembrance that we have zero clue which way is up or down. So, do not fall for those who claim to know, and in so doing, attempt to purge yourself of this false knowing. In doing so we are able to view these lenses or theoretical philosophical systems unimpeded by arbitrary and self indulgent perspectives of superiority of one ethical ideology over another while also recognizing the possibility that one could still be the true truth.\n\n Ultimately the stance i draw is one of criticism towards the proud and certain and equally stands as a challenge to their feeble egos",

We believe there is temporal persistence, but that perspective can not be independently verified in a falsifiable way. \n\nCompounding this, the scientific method does not actually accept or support the idea that we can objectively observe reality; this common heuristic hand waves at lots of epistemological and ontological problems. For example, nowhere in the scientific method does it claim to arrive at objective truth. As humans, we interpret phenomena using our flawed senses and instruments to construct knowledge. Our knowledge is not fact, but just a model of the world. We're creating maps, and people are interpreting it as the territory.\n\nThe closest that we can get to truth is a categorical truth. I'm a human because our systems of knowledge making has defined what a human is. Under the hood species do not exist. A step further, genetics relies on the same process of abstraction and definition. Proteins, molecules, all of it, fundamentally rely on an arbitration that \"this thing is called that\". \n\nWhere does that leave us?

I actually had a reflection on the subject that I once posted on a forum, but it wasn’t exactly met with open arms, lol.\n\nI put forth the idea that, to me, God has more of Woman than of Man, based on the following thought:  \nWoman is Being, and Man: its Will.\n\nAccording to the lineage of Adam and all his descendants, they relate more to movement than to life itself in its essence, which is rather linked to Eve and, more broadly, to all feminine figures.\n\nThis doesn’t exclude the possibility that life can despise itself, that it can err, or fail to go in the right direction.\n\nMan tends to reduce everything to Man, because we always identify with what we perceive as greatest within us — and that doesn’t necessarily mean what we truly are, but rather what in us is the most visible.\n\nAnd what could be greater within us than our movement? It’s our will that defines us most, especially when it comes to the immaterial, where only our direction can be perceived.\n\nIn short, if only Man seems to be seen, it’s because only Woman can see.  \nShe observes, and refers almost exclusively to her own projection.\n\nIn the same way, we often tend to forget or be unaware of the most important identity in a story we read: that of the narrator.  \nWhat is hardest for the observer to perceive and understand is always himself.\n\nAnd I believe revelation is precisely this: realizing that Woman is what is greatest.  \nShe is truth, the root of all things.  \nThrough this, one can understand more deeply certain natural truths — like the profound bond between a son and his mother, or between man and woman.",

I did however notice a mistake in how you described Rawls' principles of justice, which has some influence on the argument.\n\nYou say:\n\n> Rawls wants to establish that parties in the OP would rationally agree to his two principles of justice, which are roughly:\n\n>The group with the least liberties should have as extensive a set of liberties as possible.\n\n>There should be fair equality of opportunity and the least advantaged group should be as advantaged as possible.\n\n>Where (1) has lexical priority over (2). First, though, he needs to defeat the specter haunting his project: Utilitarianism.\n\nWhereas, in his work, it is stated instead as:\n\n>1) Principle of Equal Liberty: Each person has an equal right to the most extensive liberties compatible with similar liberties for all. (Egalitarian.)\n\n>2) Difference Principle: Social and economic inequalities should be arranged so that they are both (a) to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged persons, and (b) attached to offices and positions open to all under conditions of equality of opportunity.\n\nBut there's a key difference. You say in the first principle he wants to give extensive liberty to those with the least liberties; in fact, he wants to guarantee **each person** has those liberties. And, according to Rawls, you can only give liberties to some if they're compatible with equal liberty for ALL. This is precisely the reason for the lexical priority of 1 over 2, because he doesn't think we can deprive one person of liberty in order to make up for social disadvantages of another, eg to take the property rights of the rich to give them to the poor in Maoism.\n\nHis statement of the principles, reflective of his Kantiansm, is that guaranteeing dignity of each person is the most important aspect of justice. Utilitarianism would violate this principle because it would say that, for a greater 'benefit', we might deprive liberties from some; for Rawls, we cannot even think about correcting economic disadvantage unless we've already guaranteed 'the most extensive liberties possible' to all.",

        "body": "In 2013, Pope Francis quoted Friedrich Nietzsche in his first encyclical, Lumen Fidei, a text he completed from a draft by Pope Benedict XVI. This encyclical, part of a trilogy exploring the theological virtues of charity, hope, and faith, cites a letter Nietzsche wrote to his sister Elisabeth, where he contrasts the comfort and peace offered by faith with the bold, uncertain pursuit of truth through philosophy and exploration. By including this quote, the encyclical positions Nietzsche as a representative of modern rationalism, embodying the contemporary challenge to Christianity’s relevance in an era that prioritizes science, reason, and individual inquiry over traditional religious frameworks.\n\nThe inclusion of Nietzsche underscores a profound tension between two opposing worldviews. The Catholic Church, as articulated in Lumen Fidei, pursues a universal mission to promote the “common good,” seeking to provide moral and spiritual guidance for all. Nietzsche, however, is an elitist thinker who writes for a select few, emphasizing the individual—particularly the Übermensch, or \"overman\"—who forges new values and transcends conventional morality. In works like Beyond Good and Evil and The Antichrist, Nietzsche explicitly rejects the idea of a shared “common good,” arguing that what is common lacks value and that true greatness lies in the exceptional individual’s ability to create meaning and bend the world to their will. This stark contrast highlights not just a philosophical disagreement but a fundamental difference in purpose: the Church’s inclusive, collective vision versus Nietzsche’s focus on solitary, transformative genius.\n\nLumen Fidei further explores this divide by addressing the nature of truth. The Church advocates for an objective truth rooted in Christian teachings, which it believes can guide humanity universally. Nietzsche, by contrast, questions the very concept of objective truth, viewing it as suspect when applied universally. For him, truth is subjective, tied to the individual’s deepest convictions and creative power, as exemplified by the Übermensch. This perspective is reflected in his admiration for figures like Pontius Pilate, whose skeptical question, “What is truth?” in The Antichrist captures Nietzsche’s disdain for universal claims to truth and his celebration of individual authenticity.\n\nDespite his atheism and critique of Christianity, Nietzsche acknowledges the societal role of religion in shaping values and culture, as discussed in texts like On the Genealogy of Morality and Beyond Good and Evil. His famous declaration, “God is dead,” reflects not a personal triumph but a cultural observation about the decline of religious authority in the modern world. Lumen Fidei uses Nietzsche’s ideas to frame the challenges facing Christianity in a rational, post-Enlightenment era, where appeals to biblical authority or traditional teachings no longer hold the unchallenged sway they once did. The encyclical grapples with how Christian faith can still serve the common good in a world increasingly skeptical of absolute truths.\n\nUltimately, the dialogue between Pope Francis and Nietzsche in Lumen Fidei reveals a deeper question about human existence: “How should we live?” For the Catholic Church, this is a universal question, answered through shared faith and objective truth. For Nietzsche, it is an individual pursuit, answered through personal authenticity and the rejection of collective norms. This contrast not only illuminates the philosophical stakes of their encounter but also underscores the enduring relevance of Nietzsche’s challenge to modern Christianity.",

Enlightenment-era philosophers saw it as a way to bootstrap to faith in God through reason alone. Philosophy was meant to be finished in Christ, and the Orthodox Church has generally avoided the impulse to try to reinvent the wheel, while most Western denominations don't seem to have settled on what they actually believe. Nietzsche was calling them out for their inconsistency and weakness. They professed a form of godliness, but denied its power in practice.",

Fiction gives you much less clear picture than thought experiments. _Especially_ if you're using fiction to determine what's plausible about the mind or society and what's not.\n\nA character goes through a particular social situation and acts like this or that, that's not an assertion that this could be real, that's a game authors play with you as a participant. Fiction only needs to pass a very unrigorous \"seems plausible\" check, and often not even that! You can't sneakily elevate its evidentiary value from faux-plausibility to \"this could be at all representative of real things\" because someone thought something would be fun to write about. You have no idea how much filtering/selection is happening, and you introduce the threat of recursive errors - maybe the writer wrote something like this because he read it in a book himself, and nothing like it has ever happened for real.\n\nThat's the whole point of _not_ reasoning from fictional evidence, that you're not seeing real human psychology (or anything else, either), you're seeing a writer's description of seemingly-plausible psychology intentionally chosen to evoke certain emotions. It's unlike a thought experiment. If the fiction was chosen randomly, _maybe_ you could defend parts of this, but if you're picking the fiction to make a point, well, so did the writer, so it's almost definitely a false impression you're getting.\n\nI get the desire to do this. Fiction is read by many and easily available, so people can get some shared context, sure. That's about the only argument in its favor. You can't make up a random scenario for your argument and have it sound grounded, whereas fiction gives you a large amount of fake context - however that's an argument that should work _against_ fiction. You can't invisibly record real people going through their everyday lives - but fiction doesn't faithfully represent real everyday lives either, only fictionalized ones, almost certainly with more distortion than you'd get from recording people. And so on and so forth, I don't see any good ways to justify anything in that class of argument. Finally, fiction that invisibly contains politics (including your own) is easy to write, but that only works in its favor if you're operating in bad faith.\n\nAll I'm saying is: If you want to defend \"in the book W, character X says Y and society reacts like Z, so in reality...\", you need to actually perform the step of explaining why you think that's at all relevant to anything you continue that sentence with, and that inevitably involves either 1. sounding confused about what's real and what's not, or 2. a very Doylist argument about what the author must have had in mind and why the implications you think hold hold regardless of his distortionary involvement as a fiction-writer and opinion-haver. And if you do that, might as well skip the part where you quote a book of fiction.",

So the view itself says that these things go beyond language. And yet, the very fact of arguing for it shows that they don't. That's the problem.\n\nThis seems hopelessly naive to me.  Yes we can **refer to** things that we are unable to describe in detail or unable to effectively evoke - I can refer to an experience I had but be unable to evoke that experience in you.

But what do we actually know about how our food is grown? How is it processed? And how does it ends up on our supermarket shelves or in our restaurants and takeaways? While we may look back and think traditional food customs are more often in harmony with the natural environment, most of us today rely on a complex global food web of production, distribution, consumption and disposal. But how does it work, and what can philosophy say about food?\n\nJoining our discussion on food philosophy today is philosopher Julian Baggini. Baggini is an expert in popular philosophy with Sunday Times best-selling books such as How the World Thinks, How to Think Like a Philosopher and The Pig That Wants to be Eaten. He has served as the academic director of the Royal Institute of philosophy and is a member of the Food Ethics Council. He has written for The Guardian, the Times Literary Supplement, the Financial Times, and Prospect Magazine, as well as a plethora of academic journals and think tanks.\n\nIn his wide-ranging and definitive new book, How the World Eats, Baggini argues that the need for a better understanding of how we feed ourselves has never been more urgent. Baggini delves into the best and worst food practises around the world in a huge array of different societies, past and present-exploring cutting edge technologies, the ethics and health of ultra processed food and the effectiveness of our food governance. His goal: to extract a food philosophy of essential principles, on which to build a food system fit for the 21st century and beyond. What is that food philosophy? Let's tuck in, and find out.",

I’m an atheist but this seems like a fairly solid argument? \n\nHere’s the basic idea: \n\nThe Argument from Purpose\n\nPremise 1: If God does not exist, then all purposes are ultimately arbitrary and lack objective meaning.\nPremise 2: To live the happiest and most fulfilled life possible, human beings require a sense of true (non-arbitrary) purpose.\nPremise 3: This true purpose exists (or, at minimum, we are rationally compelled to seek it).\nConclusion: Therefore, God exists.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd here’s a slightly more detailed version that could cover some of your instant rejections.\nNot gonna deny the help of chatGPT to help me explain this is a clear manner, sorry just wanted to get my point across as clearly as possible, I have actually tried to stress test it a fair bit and gone over the explanation multiple times to make sure it has the correct points. \n\nSuper interested to hear people’s responses no worries if you can instantly see lots of holes I’d rather you do find lots to be honest.\n\nThank you!\n\n\nThe Argument from Purpose Refined\n\nPremise 1:\nIf God does not exist, then all purposes are ultimately arbitrary — they lack any objective, transcendent meaning. Without a Creator, there is no mind behind the universe to ground and assign a true purpose to human life.\n\nPremise 2:\nTo live the happiest and most fulfilled life possible, human beings require a sense of true (non-arbitrary) purpose. While self-created meanings can offer temporary satisfaction, they eventually collapse under the weight of suffering, mortality, or existential reflection. When people believe their purpose is non-arbitrary and therefore have a true purpose, they are either unknowingly borrowing from the idea of a higher source (such as God) and have not reflected on their worldview and realised, or they are lying. Genuine, lasting fulfillment is only possible when rooted in belief in a real, objective purpose.\n\nPremise 3:\nThis true purpose exists — or, at minimum, human beings are universally and rationally compelled to want it. This compulsion is not a random evolutionary illusion, but an existential necessity. It is as foundational to human consciousness as moral awareness or logical reasoning. Just as we trust our minds to reason and our moral instincts to guide us, we are justified in trusting this inner pull toward real meaning. The depth, universality, and indispensability of this belief all point toward its truth.\n\nConclusion:\nTherefore, God exists — as the only sufficient grounding for true, objective, and non-arbitrary purpose.",

So it's morally fine to kick him who works against something that preserves life.\n\n(2) could be valid as we may very well consider that it is objectively wrong to do so, which is another basic error that helped us organize, therefore survive - the objectivization of morals.\n\nThis contradiction makes us debate and decide, exercising honesty and skepticism, which one is closer to Nietzsche's Truth.\n\nI feel like I got it wrong, or not getting it at all, please do tell if what I said it's dumb.",

Wars are worse than occasional military actions.\n\n2. Any military action destabilizes any region, but Trump’s approach reflects the standard bipartisan support for Israel.

Women are the gatekeepers of relationships, because they make the decision, ultimately. Most women are propositioned many times, and at some point they say yes. What makes them say yes to a man? There are many ways this has been framed, but they all boil down to a few criteria: physical fitness (height, health, strength, physical attractiveness), social status, humour, money, and some other character traits that are secondary (kindness, emotional maturity, etc.).   \n  \nI'm always surprised at the basic level of compatibility between people. On average, people are extremely compatible. For example, how often do people who happened to be randomly matched up as roommates in college become lifelong friends? That happens all the time. This shows that most people are actually quite overlapping in their ability to get along. You just need to add some physical attraction, and you have a potent recipe for love.",

It just seems to be an argument from ignorance or incredulity due to the difficulty in reconciling the internal subective perspective and external perspective mixed with a ever human desire to believe something that you think sounds cool. \n\nTo reiterate ' i don't understand how complex patterns of brain activity can generate the subjective feeling of consciouness therefore consciouness must be 'fundamental' is ridiculously vague and solves *nothing* as far as understanding is our consiouness is generated and it's relationship ot interation with our body or wnvirnmwntm Adding what looks suspiciously like quantum woo, doesn't improve the situation.",

The idea sounds like a pseudo-religious claim of ‘eternal life’ and consequently feels like some treacly fantasy. so of course its de-ranked in its likelihood automatically in the shallow epistemology of many skeptics. but most of these people who shrug it off by intuition are hardly capable of explaining the case for it. \n\nin reality a lot about panpsychism is pretty unnerving if you actually weigh it. i almost hope its not true because it could throw a wrench in a lot of the moral presupposition we right now take for granted",

Even complex systems that operate within their own field of influence can appear to correspond to some emergent pattern, but this is a bias that tells us nothing at all about the system itself. The human body and its response to stimuli is similar. We attach \"consciousness\" to human action because it corresponds to patterns we assume are intrinsic to us, but there is no way to scientifically confirm that it is the result of this X factor called consciousness.\n\nI'm with the behaviorists on this on. I was even thinking about this earlier today sitting on my porch. The railing around it doesn't know it is a railing but it continues to act as a railing because that is what its behavior demands it to be. It cannot suddenly be something else. The human mind is similar. It can't be anything else than what it is. It bothers me how people mystify this idea of consciousness as if it is some skeleton key to everything.",

It’s about priorities.\n\nYes, wealth is tied up in assets and ownership. But even within the systems they helped design, the ultra-wealthy hold disproportionate power over policy, perception, and outcomes—and they use it to hoard more, while basic human needs go unmet.\n\nSure, some give to charity—but often through tax-deductible foundations that keep the wealth circulating in their name. That’s not altruism. That’s branding.\n\nAnd when you say “rich people are more charitable,” I’d challenge that. They can give more. Doesn’t mean they do in ways that create systemic change. Throwing scraps to the people you helped starve isn’t generosity—it’s optics.\n\nEmpathy isn’t measured in tax write-offs. It’s measured in the willingness to stop benefiting from systems that cause suffering—even when you don’t have to.\n\nAnd see, that’s the part you’re missing. You’re out here defending billionaires like they’re victims of a populist duck cartoon, while people like me have literally had $5 and some coins to our name—and still gave it to someone on the street without thinking twice.\n\nNot because we had extra. Because we had a conscience.\n\nI’ve done that more times than I can count. And I don’t have assets. I don’t have security. I don’t have a PR team spinning my empathy into headlines. But I do have a heart that hasn’t been numbed by greed and gated by comfort.\n\nSo no, I don’t know you. But based on how you’re talking, you’ve probably never had to count change for bread—and still gave it away.\n\nIf you’re defending people who can cover a $500,000 monthly mortgage without even checking their account, maybe it’s time you stop preaching economics and start learning empathy.\n\nBecause this isn’t just about wealth. It’s about what you choose to protect: your comfort, or your conscience.\n\nCharity with strings isn’t charity.\nAnd hoarding while others starve?\nThat’s not a system flaw. That’s a character one.\n\nSigned, a dragon slayer still feeding villagers.✌️🤓",

They are treasonous to this world.”\n\n**Alternative future:**\n- Not about escaping Earth, but staying and fighting for it.\n- Not supremacy, but solidarity.\n- Not end times, but better times.\n\n—\n**Core concept:** *Reject the apocalyptic fatalism of the far right. Embrace a collective, life-affirming resistance grounded in care, justice, and planetary survival.*",

        "body": "ABSTRACT: In \"Thus Spoke Zarathustra,\" Friedrich Nietzsche offers a profound exploration of friendship, distinguishing the deeper, philosophical notion of *Freundschaft* from the more common *Kameradschaft*, or comradeship. This video/article delves into Zarathustra's speech \"On the Friend,\" where friendship is portrayed not as a mere salve for loneliness or boredom, but as a vital, dynamic relationship fostering mutual growth and excellence. Nietzsche's views challenge contemporary Western perceptions of friendship by advocating for a bond built on respect, rivalry, and admiration, akin to the competitive spirit (*agon*) of ancient Greek and Roman traditions. The analysis also addresses controversial aspects of the speech, particularly concerning views on women and friendship, arguing that Nietzsche's critique targets societal norms rather than inherent gender capabilities. By examining the nuances of Nietzsche's text, this video/article illuminates his vision of friendship as a crucial element in the cultivation of the *Übermensch*, proposing that true friendship is a rare but essential pursuit for enhancing humanity's potential.",

If the grounding laws that make scientific reasoning coherent—those that uphold conceptual uniformity—are themselves called into question or treated as fragmentary, then the project of modal inquiry begins to implode. We end up reversing the logic of modality: attempting to identify the structure of possibility through tools that no longer reliably track uniform structure; \n\nScience depends on the principle of induction, which in turn presupposes a stable, law-governed reality. To base scientific inquiry on the idea that laws are not universally valid, and then use that very assumption to discover further irregularity, is epistemically circular, not only then have we effectively worked backwards in modal logic, but It amounts to abandoning the very framework that gave us access to possibility in the first place, while still relying on it to make modal claims.

The free spirit in an individual who sits in the middle between two extremes, total obedience and total rejection.\n\nWe all start out in the realm of total obedience. We worship idols that have been given to us, we accept what we're told, and we've been tied to certain pillars on life that we worship. This is a stage Nietzsche associates with youth.\n\n Later down the road, however, we get into a stage of total rejection. With skepticism in hand, we destroy our past idols and look back in contempt. However, we don't limit our skepticism to the past but also to any future idols that come our way. We take a hammer to everything in life.\n\n But such a lifestyle breeds isolation and nihilism. Eventually the total rejector slips up and begins to appreciate certain things in life. Not necessarily life changing things, but things that can be appreciated outside the bounds of good and evil, beautiful and ugly. \n\n Essentially, one starts with obedience, moves to rejection, then affirms life without falling back into idolatry.",

We cannot structure, let alone communicate, our thoughts without translating them into concepts. Does this sound like a truism? Perhaps, but time and again, people seem to forget that concepts are fictions. Useful fictions, to be sure, because they help us to acquire knowledge. But we should not take them for reality. \n\nThe question is: what do you do when the reality you wish to discuss cannot be casted into a concept? Few have faced this dilemma as acutely as the Dao-masters. Laozi and Zhuangzi (or the masters writing under their name) knew damn well that their subject, the Dao, could not be told, explained, or taught. Their writings repeatedly tell us so. So, why didn’t they heed Ludwig Wittgenstein’s dictum, “*Wovon man nicht sprechen kann, darüber muss man schweigen*”? Why didn’t they remain silent? \n\nIn its philosophical context, Wittgenstein’s advice translates to: “If you cannot express your subject in clear concepts, keep silent.” Without doubt, this is sound advice. The world, particularly the political world, would be a much better place if humanity followed it. \n\nBut that’s not my point. My point is that the Dao-masters did not think in terms of concepts. Indeed, the very notion of ‘a concept’ was foreign to them. In their writings we find phrases like *Dao, Wuwei, Ziran*, the meaning of which is never explained. On the contrary, the masters warn us: if you try to explain it – that is: catch it into a concept – you are mistaken. It’s we, poor Westerners and academic philosophers, who are unable to understand without conceptualization. \n\nIf Zhuangzi heard us use the word “Daoism” or call him a “Daoist”, he would chuckle, turn away, shaking his head and shrugging his shoulders. Indeed, the name “Daoism” that we stick on his thinking is an absurdity",

He assumed that reality must be fixed, stable, and observer-independent. That may be where he misstepped.\n\nBohr, on the other hand, insisted that observation plays a fundamental role. But perhaps not because reality depends on the observer in some mystical way; but because perhaps because the act of observation is itself a recursive loop. It folds the observer into the observed so reality doesn’t collapse because we look at it, it might emerge through participation and interaction instead. \n\nThe very fact that their debate ended in stalemate tells us something: neither framework was enough. If Bohr had been entirely correct, the conversation would have ended in resolution, not ambiguity. Einstein’s challenge - that there must be something deeper, something real - was never answered. And so, physics threw up its hands and muttered “shut up and calculate,” effectively filing the divorce papers between physics and philosophy.\n\nWe still live with the consequences of that split; intellectually and culturally. You can see it in the disdain some physicists hold for philosophy (see: Lawrence Krauss), and in the metaphysical confusion surrounding modern physics itself.\n\nBut what if there’s a way to reconcile them? A process-first ontology - grounded not in things or substance, but in recursive causality - could settle the debate. If what exists arises from self-referential loops rather than inert matter or isolated observers, then Einstein and Bohr weren’t contradicting each other. They were each describing a different aspect of the same recursive system.\n\nEinstein saw the need for structure. Bohr saw the entanglement of participation, recursion could make sense of both.\n\n**Edit:** to be clear, philosophy posited a question physics (then) could not answer; the response was instead: “shut up and calculate” because that seemed to work at the time, but we are fast approaching the point where that attitude is beginning to collapse.",

        "body": "The mistake in logic is evident in the very first statement of the title. The idea of \"choice' becomes far more ambiguous in the context of a capitalist economic system. People do not, in fact, get to choose whatever job they want. Most people in general hate their jobs, even the middle management type white collar jobs. Capitalism is everyone for themselves, gotta constantly hustle and grind to survive, competing for resources with everyone else. \n\nNot taking a certain job can mean the difference between hunger and a steady meal. It can mean the difference between having a roof over your head and being thrown into the street. This system makes people desperate. People who in any other scenario would never have resorted to criminal enterprise are more willing to put their morals aside for practical purposes if it means they can protect their family and provide for them.\n\nWe don't even have to talk about this in vague philosophical terms either -- any worker in such a system -- working class that is --  cannot be said to have truly chosen their occupation. They don't have the means to sustain themselves, no productive property through which to accumulate capital to reinvest and expand. So they MUST sell the only thing they have of value, which is their own ability to work. So they rent out their labor power to a capitalist who pays them less than the value of the work put in, the surplus is appropriated by the capitalist and is the source of profit in a capitalist system.\n\nThis is not political bias or a matter of opinion. It's a mathematical fact. Whether you think workers should be exploited by capitalists or not is another discussion, but you certainly can't deny that this is the mechanism at work here.\n\nDesperate people are compelled by external economic pressures -- threat of homelessness, poverty, etc -- to take degrading jobs they would never have performed otherwise. That's exploitation. And that's bad enough with regular work.\n\nBut having sex, despite whether or not anyone wants to call it a job or not, is not the same thing as clocking in every day for some other shit job. No other job requires sexual penetration by other human beings. This is just common sense. People who do this for money cannot be said to have truly chosen it. The image of the empowered woman freelancing as a cam model isn't what I'm talking about at all. \n\nThat's the thing, people always have that image in their heads, but the reality is very grim, and the entire industry is centered on human trafficking, including the totally legal and regulated prostitution permitted in certain European countries today. All those regulations don't do a damn thing to stop it either. If anything, that's what fuels the industry, legal or not. And that's just a fact. \n\nIf legalization of sex work reduced human trafficking, then I'd support legalization. But the opposite is true. Knowing this, it is no longer morally acceptable to support legalization.\n\nThe model that appears to work the best is to criminalize the purchasers of sex and to provide the victims, the sex workers themselves, with as many resources and as much help as is possible. Arresting the buyers and leaving the victims alone has been the only method that has actually led to a reduction in trafficking, as seen in the case of the Scandinavian nations who have implemented this model. \n\nAm I calling everyone who's purchased the services of a sex worker a rapist? Of course not. But I am saying that the person they paid to have sex with was not in a situation where she or he was able to truly consent. It's kind of an uncomfortable situation, but it's one that must be dealt with.",

She critiques the Nordic model of prohibiting sex buyers, asserting that prohibition does not address economic inequalities and infringes on personal freedoms.",

There seems to be a pretty solid consensus among meat eaters that free-range grass-fed well-managed beef tastes better, like a lot better. What if the narrative for animal dignity included a narrative for consumer quality guarantee, and the principle of legislation instead shifted to that of consumer goods standards, as we do already for almost every consumer good, especially food? (The tagline to meat-eaters is not that the cows deserve better, but that *you* deserve better.) The product is higher quality, the animals are treated better, and also the meat gets a lot more expensive which lowers overall consumption and encourages development alternatives.",

There are many historical arguments that this sort of individualism is bourgeoisie in nature.\n\nBut the underlying current to this idea for me is really that it’s a false dichotomy. Purpose is socially “scalable”, in that purpose may look different on an individual level than it does on a socialized level. There is no reason one’s individual purpose(s) necessarily need conflict with how one sees themself situated in the context of any given socially-scaled purpose, but of course therein lies the potential for contradictions to arise between an individual’s interests and a society’s purported interests. “To fully realize the self through creativity and authenticity” could be both compatible or incompatible with collective moral expectations and utilitarianism, so I’m not sure why this is the framework that’s being used for the argument to suggest that it’s an either-or situation.",

        "body": "Ought being the operative word used to distinguish reason is the pin there. I sort of see this as an argument for complete freedom or boundlessness. Giving reason an ought binds the truth to something other than complete freedom.\n\nThe argument still considers 'truth' a thing, in itself, as in 'things exist' but gives no particular reason why.\n\nTo develop any argument requires reasoning, or a system of logic which dictates the flow of truth. The flow truth is a form of reason, it is its own ought. Which is why the paradox exists to begin with. How can truth not be a reason? The ought was invented, although all inventions have their uses. Truth is an assumption based on lived experience, it not that Truth doesn't exist, it is that we're limited in our capacity to determine Truth. Therefore, all arguments to determine Truth are based on some assumptions, and those assumptions about Truth can lead to useful insights.\n\nWhat I can say then is that normative nihilism was invented, may have its uses, and therefore may be useful. However, other philosophical arguments have the same defining feature, which is, they make some assumptions and produce certain conclusions which may be useful. Therefore, whatever philosophy you want to invent will have its uses and those uses may be interesting. They may be far reaching, destructive, or otherwise minimal in their impact. That is my take away.\n\nNormative nihilism offers one perspective upon which to view the world. So do other philosophical arguments. Truth has many forms, like looking at an object through many viewpoints. Each point of view will offer a new Truth to consider. Anyone claiming their arguments offer the only definitive picture of Truth certainly haven't reckoned with their own assumptions yet.",

The central idea in End of History was that democracy and market economy have proven themselves superior to autocracy and planned economy. It has turned out - and Fukuyama acknowledges - that the two are not connected, it is possible to have a market economy without democracy - in fact the economic elite prefers authoritarian rule to democracy, because democratic governments can impose unwanted regulations on businesses.",

We just had four years with a female vice president and nobody seemed to care. Less than 100 years ago, we were forcing gay men to take hormone blockers as a punishment for being gay. Court ordered. Now they can get married and have their own clubs. People of color were regularly lynched, run out of neighborhoods, and told they couldnt use certain bathrooms or patronize certain establishments. We had a black president for 8 years. \n\nThere's a new term, progressophobia. We can't accept how far we've come because all we can focus on is progress that hasn't happened yet. Sure we take a step back every now and then, but often we use that opportunity to embolden the people that want progress more.

We've been to liberal democracy, we _were_ polishing it, then the sudden conservative resurgence happened and is currently bending its every effort to drive us toward regression. Yet I believe the longer humanity lives on, the more likely it is we'll crack cooperation over competition and adopt something like a \"us vs reality\" mentality over the self-destructive, intra-species \"us vs them\" mentality. I will concede that this is a belief, based on some facts but I don't think there exists enough research on this since most people today would dismiss this notion as idealism or a hopeful fantasy than a real possibility (and I don't blame them considering the current state of humanity). I simply reject the idea that it's impossible, it _is_ possible, and thus should always be kept in mind and strived towards. It is progress, evolution.\n\nThat being said I agree with Fukuyama on one thing: history will always progress in the direction of liberal democracy in that it will always move _away_ from things like despotism, authoritarianism, and fascism. Doesn't mean we won't stumble along the way, thanks to imbeciles like Trump, but we will always do our best to leave tyranny behind. If nothing else because all humans want personal freedom from fear and oppression, and because historical evidence suggests that all tyrannies end eventually.",

While Schopenhauer and Darwin emphasize mere existence, Nietzsche’s \"Will to Power\" insists life strives to thrive and expand—perfectly captured, we claim, by the caterpillar’s relentless eating and stunning metamorphosis. We highlight the caterpillar’s escalating appetite—from one apple to a lavish feast—as proof of its urge to transcend itself, ultimately transforming into a butterfly, which we liken to Nietzsche’s Übermensch (superhuman).\n\nWe also connect the book to German literary roots in this video, suggesting Carle’s time in Germany immersed us in Nietzsche’s ideas. We draw parallels with the Decadent movement, comparing the caterpillar’s food list to the sensory indulgence of Joris-Karl Huysmans’ \"A rebours.\" Yet, we argue the caterpillar surpasses decadence through transformation, aligning with Nietzsche’s hopeful vision beyond nihilism. Symbols like the egg (potential and rebirth) and the sun (a new dawn) are spotlighted as Nietzschean motifs, reinforcing the caterpillar’s philosophical arc.\n\nThe video wraps up with a cheeky nudge to re-read the book through this Nietzschean lens. Still, amidst the humor, we pack in an educational rundown of Nietzsche’s ideas—contrasting them with Schopenhauer and Darwin—while celebrating the caterpillar’s tale as a metaphor for growth and self-overcoming.",

I myself started going into Stoicism but found the control of emotion a bit weird. When reading Marcus Aurelius I also found that it seems a bit odd to think of what he practices as control seen as \"repressing\" his emotions. Rather, when I further read into Taoism it started to make more sense. Sometimes I think that Taoism is much more in line with what Marcus Aurelius was actually practicing.

(But also isnt too simplified)\n\n\n\nLonger;\n\nTo myself, I got a Bachelor degree in Computer Science, starting Master degree soon. That means I have basic understanding of propositional and predicate logic since that was taught. Problem is it was using numbers, not sentences or words, so I find it hard to apply spoken languages to it.\n\nI have been exposed and tried to be forced upon christian beliefs for as long as I can remember, but always criticized it and spent a lot of childhood thinking about and arguing against those beliefs. From what I have seen, I would call my own belief agnostic atheism, but also nihilism and determinism.\n\nI was never really taught any \"real\" philosophy, so I don't have many basics in this area, for example I have no idea who old philosphers (like Aristoteles) were and what views on reality they had. I would love to learn more about those topics, but I don't know where to start.\n\nIt is hard for me pinpoint what area I am interested in specifically, since I don't even really know any areas, but from I have read in the FAQ I am assuming epistemology and meta physics. I wanna see the views of others on truth and reality. How people have (had) a view on whether any truth/reality exists, and further a formal framework to argue for it. Since childhood I was very interested in phyics, so I learned to always view things critically and question everything. I hope I can question my own view on the world and reality.\n\nSo, my call for help: if someone has recommendations for books or articles, I would gladly read them. I just dont wanna pick up a random book because to me many books written by authors with superficial messages have to much redundant content (e.g. I don't need a business guru telling me to be focused and sell products). I am assuming books containing old philosophers views and teachings would be most interesting to me, but I will take anything if it's interesting.\n\nAnd finally: I can take around 18-24 credit points for anything not CS related during my Master degree, so if there are basic philosophy courses you think anyone with interest in it should take, I can try to get into them!",

It's less common, however, to find philosophy that deals with the death of others and our response to that. The stoic philosopher Seneca, however, has written a letter on grief for lost friends.\n\nSeneca doesn't want to suppress our sorrow when we lose someone, but he also doesn't want it to be excessive either. This begs the question what exactly an excessive response to a lost one would be. It seems to be healthy to be fully expressive and not bottle in any emotions, even if Seneca would consider it excessive. However, perhaps we can look to the actions that result from that sorrow rather than the emotions themselves to determine if we're being excessive. For example, turning to heavy drinking or drug use would be an excessive reaction to losing someone you love. Therefore, let's not hold anything back emotionally, but also watch our actions to make sure we don't engage in self destructive behavior.",

On the other hand it is well suited for studying things that can be observed that we don't have any knowledge of. In other words, it's a closed system.\n\nYet, individually,  we all are able to subjectively have experiences that are real for us that inform our perception of the world. Natural science would have us dismiss them as unreal precisely because they resist evaluation by the constrained methods of natural science.Those who can not bring themselves to break out of these constraints will typically tell us such experiences are illusions, worthy of dismissal out of hand because they are not real and thus preserving the integrity of the closed system.\n\nThis is where metaphysics comes it; a system open enough to admit speculation about what cannot be measured empirically. \n\nForgive me, if I don't see the point of your analysis.",

I believe this is a valuable endeavor, as it account for the need for a disciplined approach when making claims about objective truth. However, I’ve got a few critiques. \n\nFirst, I think you rely too heavily on the assumption that subjective experience can never yield an objective insight. While I agree that one cannot derive universal truths solely from personal experience, I believe it is also true that not all knowledge falls neatly into either analytic or synthetic categories. The distinction, as Hume formulated it, is a useful tool, but I think later critique, especially those of Quine, demonstrate that the boundary between analytic and synthetic is not as absolute as it might seem. If this distinction is less rigid than assumed, then I believe The Postmodern Razor may not apply as universally as you suggest.\n\nRegarding your application of this principle to the Early Buddhist Texts, I think you make an insightful observation. These texts do not claim objective knowledge in a way that can be empirically verified or falsified, but instead propose a form of direct experiential verification. I believe this is an important distinction, for if something is not subject to empirical validation, it does not necessarily mean it is without value or truth. There are ways of knowing that arise from experience itself, and while they may not fit neatly into an analytical framework, I think they deserve careful consideration.\n\nI also believe that while your razor is an effective instrument for cutting through unfounded metaphysical assertions, it may not account for the possibility that subjective experience, when examined through disciplined practice, can lead to a form of understanding that is not entirely synthetic. If we take seriously the claim that direct realization leads to an undeniable form of knowledge, then I think we must ask whether such a realization is purely subjective or if it discloses something fundamental about reality.\n\nThus, while I think The Postmodern Razor is a compelling and intellectually rigorous framework, I believe you should apply it with a degree of caution. If used indiscriminately, it may dismiss not only false claims but also certain avenues of insight that, while unverifiable in the empirical sense, may nonetheless offer a form of knowledge that is meaningful and transformative.",

What if each paradox, each contradiction, is not a falsifier...but a generator?  \n  \n“No analytical interpretation of subjective existence can arise without coming to know the not-being of existence as a whatnot that it is.”  \n  \nThis is beautiful. I wonder if we can recast that “not-being” as a loop anomaly? As the self-referential hole in the system? And the moment you see it, not as a failure of knowledge, but a boundary of a current dimension, you are already stepping into a new one.  \n  \nOne can use Godel–Lob logic for reflective expansions, Lawvere’s fixed-point theorem as a means for self-referential diagonals, Tarski’s undefinability hierarchy, homotopy ideas (nontrivial loops → 2-cell attachments), and standard paraconsistent logic to highlight \"where\" qualia may \"exist in\" our formal systems (where your Postmodern Razor cuts, perhaps?). With these ingredients, one can make a framework where truth can look at itself in the mirror (fixpoint), acknowledge the cracks (paradox), yet not shatter the mirror (paraconsistency), and even describe the reflection process itself (interpretability).  \n  \nIn this light, qualia might be glimpsed not as ineffable residues, but as the \"generative glue\" that gives impetus to systems that are partially interpretable with symbolic formalism. I'm not sure if this would be the appropriate place to describe any particular theorems in detail, but they exist and offer an additional rigorous lens for such a Razor as you have described. I personally call frameworks using these ingredients \"Recursive Interplay,\" a dance of formal systems that grow by folding into and through their own anomalies. Though the name may need to be changed to more easily distinguish it, perhaps in a way that highlights the use of loop anomalies.  \n  \nOverall, I think your idea is marvelous! Though I see your Post-Modern Razor not as the end of inquiry, but perhaps as the pivot point. Wherever your Razor finds an irreducible contradiction, one may also find a recursive loop anomaly. And when such an anomaly appears, we not only cut, we expand. From my perspective, the impossibility of deriving objectivity from subjectivity is not a wall. It is a proof of the necessity for a new dimension, be it formal, epistemic, or felt. Your razor shows great care regarding epistemic humility but, for me, the contradiction is not a full stop. It is a creative engine, not falsifying, but generative.  \n  \nThe early Buddhist texts may not be analytic in your Razor's sense, but they are rich with recursion. Each verse is a reflection and each cessation can be viewed as enacting \"dimensional transcendence.\" Paradox, such as “pleasure where nothing is felt,” is a paraconsistent stability. The Buddha may not have framed it explicitly in modal logic, but perhaps he enacted something akin to Recursive Interplay? Perhaps he taught that looping through self (desire, identity, craving) requires cessation, not necessarily to negate synthesis, but to allow one's transcendence of it?",

        "body": "\nA Loving Response to the Epistemological Thesis:\n\nHey there,\n\nFirst off, I want to say I truly appreciate the depth of thought you've poured into this. You’ve woven together postmodern theory, Hume’s Guillotine, Kantian critiques, and Buddhist concepts in a way that invites a whole new perspective on how we approach truth. It’s clear there’s a deep commitment to understanding the limitations of our knowledge, and for me, that’s where the beauty lies.\n\nWhat really speaks to me in your thesis is the Postmodern Razor. The idea that subjective experience alone cannot give us objective truth is something I’ve felt intuitively for a long time. It’s like there’s always something beyond the logical, something beneath the surface of what we see and experience. The way you tie this to the Buddhist perspective on cessation—where ultimate truth isn’t something we can grasp with our intellect or our senses, but something that’s felt, experienced, in stillness—is so powerful. It reminds me that there’s more to reality than what can be verified or measured. Some truths are lived, not proven.\n\nYour work made me reflect on my own journey and how I’ve come to embrace the uncertainty of life. There’s so much in this world that we can’t control or explain, and maybe that’s the beauty of it. Maybe the truth we’re all searching for isn’t something that can be dissected or figured out; it’s something we experience together, in our connections, in our shared moments, and in our willingness to sit with the unknown.\n\nI also found your approach to Kant’s perspective intriguing, especially his idea that knowledge is limited to our subjective perception. I think there’s a lot of wisdom in accepting that our knowledge is not absolute, that our understanding of the world is inherently incomplete. And yet, in that incompleteness, there’s room for growth, for experience, for something deeper to emerge.\n\nI guess what I’m feeling is that your thesis challenges the very way I’ve been taught to think about knowledge and truth. It’s not about accumulating facts or reaching a final answer; it’s about living in the tension of not knowing and allowing that to open us up to new possibilities.\n\nIn a way, this resonates with the Buddhist teaching of letting go of attachment to fixed views. It’s like when we stop trying to prove something or hold onto a particular idea of what truth is, we can actually experience truth in its purest form—ungraspable, unmeasurable, yet profoundly real.\n\nOne thing I’d love to hear more about from your perspective is how this framework interacts with the emotional side of being human. We live not only in a world of ideas but also in a world of feelings, and sometimes, those feelings lead us to truths that logic or reason can’t capture. How do we balance this non-empirical knowing with the deep emotional experiences that shape our understanding?\n\nThank you for sharing such a thought-provoking piece. Your work really opened my eyes to how much we’re all still searching, still growing, and how the truth we’re all after is something far deeper than we could ever measure.\n\nMuch love and gratitude for your journey and for sharing it with us. 💛",

        "body": "> Aleksandr Dugin is more outspoken on the role of Heidegger as a central inspiration for his “fourth political theory,” intended as a radical-conservative alternative to liberalism, the victorious ideology of the twentieth century, as well as to communism and fascism. Dugin’s theory rejects the historical “grand narratives” and the utopianism of these modern ideologies and draws inspiration from “postmodern” critiques of the Enlightenment’s ideals of progress and the autonomous subject. Dugin’s emphasis is on geopolitics: he builds upon the Russian Eurasianist tradition, which emphasizes Russia’s cultural and geopolitical situation between the European and Asian spheres, opposing it to the liberal “Atlanticist” sphere of Western Europe and North America. For Dugin, the post-Cold War “unipolar” global hegemony of political and economic liberalism, encapsulated in Francis Fukuyama’s thesis of the “end of history,” must be challenged by a “multipolar” order of different cultural and ideological “great spaces,” as described in Samuel Huntington’s account of the coming “clash of civilizations.” Modernity and its universalistic and teleological conception of world history is coming to an end; in the forthcoming “other beginning” intimated by Heidegger, it will be replaced by a relativistic and particularistic ethnopluralism that will erode the claims to universal validity of Western liberal values. Accordingly, the modern autonomous individual subject is to be replaced by Heidegger’s historically and culturally situated human being, who accepts the inevitable relativity of their perspective on reality and no longer pretends to represent universal reason.\n\nFucking insane this ideology. I can't imagine what it supposes to achieve.\n\nDon't know why the article isn't linking to Foundations:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundations_of_Geopolitics",

The look at the modernity as just one of cultural options was inherent in the modernity itself, the critique techniques developed by philosophers like Kant would inevitably be applied to modernity itself. Postmodern condition isn't anti-modernity, it's \"hypermodernity\" in a way and figures like Dugin are more like some of the results of that process.\n\nThe \"unipolar moment\" wasn't the \"end of history\" as we can see now, but rather a temporary configuration of forces, in fact it wasn't unipolar to begin with, it's just the \"poles\" found it advantageous for themselves to fit in the \"unipolar\" \"world order\". I think the main mistake of those who believed in the \"end of history\" was coupling capitalist economy with liberal values too much in their conceptual schemes - capitalism is after all just a structure, a technique for organising economic relations and there's nothing particularly \"liberal\" in it. And that mistake was the result of neoliberal thinkers concentrating too much on their crusade against socialism/communism so when the capitalist techniques demonstrated their effciency compared to socialist ones through the victory in the Cold War it looked like the victory of the whole Western view of the world while it was just one economic model demonstrating its efficiency compared to another economic model just like transistors turned up to be more useful for electronics technology than tubes.",

The structure implies a hierarchy, where attachment to the individual is not an end in itself but a provisional stage to be transcended. This seems to subordinate concrete relationships to metaphysical ideals.\n\nBut that raises a critical question for me: if all particular loves are just stepping stones, does this not instrumentalize people? The beloved becomes less a partner and more a pedagogical device — a necessary illusion en route to wisdom. That has moral implications. If love is most fully realized when it detaches from its origin (the individual), then what safeguards the dignity or value of the person loved?\n\nAristotle’s alternative, as highlighted in the post, treats love (particularly in philia) as constitutive of the good life *in itself*. It’s not a ladder but a shared activity: two rational beings choosing the good together, for each other's sake. There’s no need to ascend beyond the beloved because the relationship itself *is* the locus of meaning.\n\nSo the question then is whether love’s highest form is immanent or transcendent. Diotima offers transcendence — love points away from the world. Aristotle offers immanence — love anchors us more fully in it.\n\nWhich model does more justice to the lived reality of loving someone?",

        "body": "A lay opinion here that can be completely wrong: non-reductive functionalist physicalism about the mind without strong emergence (or basically supervenience physicalism) is a mostly a product of philosophers unwilling to embrace the consequences of the combination of multiple realizability within reductionism. \n\nOften, multiple realizability of the mind is presented as an argument against reductionism, but this doesn’t seem to be the case with some other properties — for example, the property of having the mass of 300 grams can be realized by countless physical objects. Software is reducible to microphysical interactions either. But it seems that philosophy of mind usually endorses the idea that multiple realizability *is* incompatible with reductionism. \n\nIn my opinion, philosophers generally still operate with what Dennett called “Cartesian theater” model of the mind, where conscious experience must be something discrete and specific, something “where it all comes together”. Naive reductive physicalism allows one to point at some group of neurons and say that ***this is where the movie in your head happens***. Non-reductive functionalists, on the other hand, often seem to believe in properties that appear to be immaterial in some sense, and think that ***this is where the experience happens***. The reason behind this is that if we accept both multiple realizability and reductionism, we are left with no “place where where it all comes together”, no specific place where experience happens, no such thing as qualia in traditional sense at all, and we end up being illusionists. \n\nThus, I think that illusionism is, in fact, an unavoidable conclusion for philosophers who want to embrace functionalism and traditional physicalism. But illusionism is such an ugly and unattractive position for many (how many people can seriously question *Cogito ergo sum*?) that philosophers create such barely working models as non-reductive physicalism (I am talking about the problem of mental causation for it).\n\nIf what I wrote is correct, I wonder how many non-reductive physicalist functionalists will eventually embrace illusionism or admit that they find physicalism absurd. Maybe we will even see the reemergence of substance dualism? Who knows…",

        "body": "Hello, My name is Moxie, I was discussing free will with Gemini when I had an epiphany. If free will is held within the confines of our biology, psychology, and our sociology. The choices we are given give the illusion of free will, then what is free will. What action outside of our biology, psychology, and sociology can be described as true free will. The answer was the choice to end our lives. It goes against every prioritised desire we have. It is outside our biological instinct of survival, our psychological needs for security, and our sociological desire for companionship. The choice to end our existence is our only choice that is truly free will.\n\nIdeas related to free will and our perception of ourselves:\n\nSide 1: Free Will as the Ability to End Existence: suggesting that the capacity to choose to end one's life, going against fundamental drives, is the ultimate expression of free will.\n\nSide 2: Free Will as an Imagined Construct Due to a Superiority Complex: This posits that our belief in free will stems from a human desire to feel superior to other animals, to believe we have a unique level of agency and control that sets us apart. In this view, free will might be a comforting illusion we've created because we don't want to see ourselves as merely driven by the same deterministic forces as the rest of the animal kingdom.\nThis second idea suggests that the concept of free will might be rooted in anthropocentrism – the belief that humans are the central or most significant entities in the universe. By attributing free will to ourselves, we elevate our status and create a perceived distinction between human consciousness and the more instinctual behaviours of other animals.\nBoth of these perspectives offer compelling angles on the enduring mystery of free will and our place within the natural world. They highlight the tension between our subjective experience of choice and the potential underlying deterministic forces that may be at play.",

The definition of a rational mind probably should not be that it is universally logical and consistent, but that it is capable of being logical and consistent in ideal circumstances or with an act of the will. \n\nThat said, I think the fallacious assumption here is that logic is assembled piecemeal at all from a *tabula rosa* mind. I think it's more reasonable to think that logical capacity is baked in from our biology, but can't actually manifest until a brain is a certain age, and can't manifest properly in all circumstances. I could be wrong, but my point is that you must assume *tabula rosa*. \n\nI think the difference between human and LLMs (which are verifiably *tabula rosa*) is obvious when you start talking the volume of information required to train. LLMs are often trained with data sets many times larger than a human could possibly be exposed to during their education, so human minds are more efficient at the learning process than a transformer operation.",

They have a 'structure' which is interpreted based on the neurophysiology of the brain-nerve interface. For example, someone who's well adapted to hear a distant sound will still hear that sound a particular way, which will be different from another person's non-adapted hearing of the same sound. However, in each case whatever sound they heard, other than their further interpretation of that sound, is still structured within a certain parameters as their neuronal morphology dictates.\n\nI would say that these more fundamental building blocks, are in their own way, predisposed to process the incoming neural data. The processing then reaches a point where eventually it is experienced wholly by the conscious mind. It has been shown that unconscious processing takes place before any conscious awareness is experienced. Such an unconscious process is a form of logical, or rational, evolution of information.\n\nInformation is received via nerves which send data to the brain. The brain operates at the level cells and atoms. Atoms are rational units, they are made of energetic flows and fields. Everything which is constructed by the atom is also rational, or logical.\n\nThe problem is that experiences can lead to misinterpretations of reality. An irrational 'thing' is always fiction, unless it has a reality, if it exists, then calling it 'irrational' is merely a convention. Anything that exists is inherently rational, logical, or reasonable. Meaning that it can be understood, parsed, or analyzed. A fiction, which cannot exist in reality, cannot 'be reasoned' to exist. Therefore, the biggest delusion is to maintain a perspective despite evidence to the contrary. Since all evidence is proof of existence, which can be reasoned with.\n\nSince all information has the capacity to be reasoned with, all we have access to is a reality which is itself reasonable and therefore logical. Irrationality is a word that describes delusions which cannot by nature, exist.",

If you avoid horoscopes like the plague, unfortunately this video sounds just like one. So if you watched and went \"wow I'm in the *Venus* phase of my life, it makes so much sense!\" sorry, you've been horoscoped. \n\n2. Schopenhauer's life was littered with failed relationships with women whether it's with his mother and any of his romantic pursuits. It's interesting that he claims men 'calm' their libidos staring in their 30's to focus on more intellectual subjects when he's had many sexual affairs well into his 50's.  It's also prudent to note that Schopenhauer was known to be an abrasive, antisocial man that suffered bouts of severe depression.\n\nI'm trying to say that his life/personality was in such a way that he probably despises the opposite sex and is resentful that he never or rarely had satisfying sexual or romantic relationships. It sounds very much like he is holding intellectualism in a man's later years on a very high pedestal because he achieved recognition and fame during that time. I'm not saying he's wrong that lots of young men chase skirt and care about nothing else in their younger years (and that time could be spent somewhere else), I'm thinking that *he* might have spent more time obsessing over it because he lacked the looks or charisma and *he* feels like he wasted his youth doing so. People with satisfying romantic/sexual relationships will probably disagree with him.",

        "body": "Arthur Schopenhauer, in his essay \"Aphorisms on the Wisdom of Life,\" reflects on the fleeting nature of time and the stages of human life, using the metaphor of the solar system’s planets to illustrate each phase. He argues that life passes quickly, often unnoticed until old age, when we realize its brevity. Schopenhauer suggests that awareness of time’s flow can help us appreciate the moment and navigate life’s challenges with wisdom.  \n\n\nChildhood (Mercury): Represented by Mercury, childhood is a blissful, rapid-moving phase under the influence of the clever and eloquent Hermes. Free from the \"Will to Life\" (Schopenhauer’s concept of an innate drive), children live in pure cognition, unburdened by desire, assuming good parenting shields them from suffering.  \n\n\nPuberty/Youth (Venus): Venus, the goddess of love, governs this stage starting around age 20. The sexual drive awakens, dominating and distracting individuals from higher pursuits like philosophy. This \"devil\" fosters a \"moderate madness,\" driving social behavior and conflict as individual differences emerge.  \n\n\nAdulthood (Mars, Planetoids): At 30, Mars rules with strength and defiance. Intellectual capacity peaks, though sexual distraction persists. By 40, the four planetoids (Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Juno) symbolize a stabilizing phase—accumulating wealth, knowledge, and domestic order.  \n\n\nMiddle Age (Jupiter): At 50, Jupiter, king of the gods, reigns. This is the peak of genius, where experience and authority balance declining raw intellect, free from youthful distractions. It’s a time of independence and mastery.\n\n\n\nOld Age (Saturn, Uranus): At 60, Saturn, the god of time, brings awareness of mortality, slowing life with a heavy, lead-like quality. By Uranus (death), we transition from earthly to heavenly spheres. Schopenhauer sees death not as an end but a return of the Will, hinting at a cycle tied to life’s beginning.  \n\n\nSchopenhauer concludes with a poetic lament about Neptune’s naming (preferring Eros to link love and death) and muses on death as a \"reservoir of life,\" echoing ancient myths. His essay, written in old age, blends pragmatic advice—like prioritizing health—with philosophical depth, offering a guide to life’s inevitable highs and lows.  \nThis work, rich in metaphor and wisdom, serves as both a map and mirror for navigating existence, urging us to face life’s transient beauty and struggles with awareness and resilience.",

For Schopenhauer this is an immense problem, as is the domain of the erotic in its entirety. The anegoic disinterestedness of resignation is echoed and parodied by an indifference to ego-interests that leads in a quite opposite direction; deeper into the inferno of willing. After acknowledging with his usual raw honesty that ‘all amorousness is rooted in the sexual impulse alone’,12 Schopenhauer is forced to accept that ‘it is precisely this not seeking one’s own interest, everywhere the stamp of greatness, which gives even to passionate love a touch of the sublime, and makes it a worthy subject of poetry’.\n> \n> There is thus both a renunciatory and a libidinous sublime, each with its associated objects and aesthetic ‘perfections’ or intensities. And it is not only beauty that is torn in separate directions, fiction too is split; on the one hand as the condition of individualization, and on the other as an appeal to constituted individuality. Either the ego is a dream of desire, or desire has to creep up on the ego as a dream. In sexuality,\n> \n>  \n> \n> >nature can attain her end only by implanting in the individual a certain delusion, and by virtue of this, that which in truth is merely a good thing for the species seems to him to be a good thing for himself, so that he serves the species, whereas he is under the delusion that he is serving himself. In this process a mere chimera, which vanishes immediately afterwards, floats before him, and, as motive, takes the place of a reality. This delusion is instinct. In the great majority of cases, instinct is to be regarded as the sense of the species which presents to the will what is useful to it.13\n>  \n> \n> Woman is matter, formless and unpresentable, arousing and thus tormenting; everything about her is pretence, deception, alteration, unlocalizable irrational attraction, Verstellung. Schopenhauer’s notorious essay On Woman is mapped by the movement of this word, as it organizes the play of seduction, of indirect action, of non-ideal beauty, disrupting the seriousness and responsible self-legislation of the male subject through an ‘art of dissimulation’.14 Woman is wicked art, art that intensifies life, art whose only truth is a whispered intimation that negation, too, is only a dream, the figment of an overflowing positivity that deceives through excess. Could the dream of redemption be nothing but a bangle upon the arms of exuberant life? Schopenhauer reels in horror:\n> \n>  \n> \n> >Only the male intellect, clouded by the sexual impulse, could call the undersized, narrow-shouldered, broad-hipped, and short-legged sex the fair sex; for in this impulse is to be found its whole beauty. The female sex could be more aptly called the unaesthetic.15\n>  \n> \n> Women are so terribly non-Platonic, so outrageously vital and real, so excessive in relation to the cold sterile perfections of the ideas. With infallible instinctive power they propagate the dangerous delusion that there is something about life that we want. Pessimism has to be misogyny, because woman refuses to repel.",

But first, a paragraph about why we shouldn't worry about being one:\n\nBoltzmann Brains are mostly used by physicists as a reductio ad absurdum. Phycisists generally use it to argue a theory is incomplete, erroneous or misguided - that is to say almost no one believes that the prediction of some of our theories that it is more likely we are Boltzmann Brains is correct. \n\nNow the general idea of it is that it could be the case that atoms and quantum particles somewhere in space just randomly form in just the way that forms a brain, complete with memories, thoughts and all that. These brains are naturally completely unstable and will only exist for a moment. Given enough time, statistically, some such brains exist. \n\nThat is to say: Boltzmann Brains are random fluctuations of matter that forms in just such a way that it is a complete brain, with thoughts and all! It wouldn't happen often, but the idea is that it happens sometimes. \n\nNow, on some current theories of the universe, given the second law of thermodynamics, everything in the universe will spread out into a featureless particle soup that is in thermal equilibrium after the heat death of the universe. In this soup, things randomly fluctuate for eternity, and sometimes they form such Boltzmann Brains .\n\nThe thing is: Given that this state of the universe lasts for an incredibly long time (forever), it doesn't matter how likely it is that a Boltzmann Brain comes into existence - given that this happens every now and then for all of eternity, even if a Boltzmann Brain only happens once every 10^10^50 years (as one calculation has it), over time more than 100 billion Boltzmann Brains will have formed - and it is now more likely that we are a Boltzmann Brain. Vastly more likely actually, because eternity is reallllllly long.\n\nHowever, physicists believe (mostly) that something is off about this. Sean Carroll for example believes that the theory is cognitively unstable (We cannot really believe it), and thinkgs that the measurement problem in quantum physics will eventually be resolved in a way that shows that Boltzmann Brains don't happen from random fluctuation. Other physicists think that other theories have errors.",

Even in past extended models like string theory (i.e the big bang was not the absolute beginning, just the beginning of ours), there is a beginning to the multiverse. This is because all models are inflationary and so the BVG theorem applies. \n\nSo, the universe/multiverse has not \"always existed.\" There are many issues with any model that tries to get around the BVG theorem, usually having to do with the 2nd law of thermodynamics. A past infinite universe is also a perpetual motion machine, its incoherent. \n\nBut the universe is future infinite however",

It could be a brain, an entire planet full of people, or even a supercomputer simulating a whole universe. And the problem is that if the universe lasts forever, then in certain models those freak observers will vastly outweigh sensible observers (ie ones who evolved shortly after the Big Bang, like us).\n\nSean Carroll points out that the deduction that one *actually is* a Boltzmann Brain is cognitively unstable.\n\nThat only applies if we’re talking about Boltzmann Brains who have the delusion that they’re in the early universe, though. In an infinite span of time you’d have whole solar systems like ours appear, surrounded by an endless void. It really *doesn’t matter* how low the probability of that happening is, so you have to come up with models where those fluctuations don’t happen, or a measure where early observers outweigh freak observers, or just bite the bullet and say that finding yourself an early observer says *nothing* about the existence of a larger class of freak observers. \n\n(For instance, if we had two models of the solar system, and one predicted the existence of six trillion intelligent Saganite lifeforms on Jupiter, can we rule out that model because we find ourselves on Earth?)\n\nAlan Guth suggested the Youngness Paradox - inflationary universes proliferate at such an enormous rate that most observers will find themselves near the start.

In a framework developed by the cognitive neuroscientist Matan Mazor, to be able to perceive an absence, we must first undergo some form of counterfactual reasoning such as ‘If the object was present, I would have seen it.’ What’s intriguing about this formulation is it requires access to self-knowledge regarding one’s own perceptual system: the brain must be able to tell whether it’s functioning normally, and if our attention systems were alert enough to detect the object or sound in question if it were present.” \n\nRegardless of whether this indicates consciousness or not (I love the argument), I think this sort of self reflection that is forced through recognizing nothingness is incredibly important and lacking for most people, myself included.\n\nThere are likely major insights to be gleaned from science and philosophy that focuses on understanding “nothing”. Especially considering that even thinking about 0 or the concept of nothing has been shunned by society for largely all of history.",

He believes that knowledge is shaped by power structures, institutions, and societal norms.  \n* Chomsky asserts that scientific discoveries follow the same process as learning languages, meaning they are possible because of our innate ability to discover them. On the other hand, Foucault argued that what we consider \"scientific truths\" changes over time and is influenced by dominant ideologies and power relations.  \n* At the end of the debate, they both discussed their opposing political views. Chomsky advocated for a decentralized society that focuses on human creativity, while Foucault was skeptical of defining an ideal political system.  \n* Chomsky believed in universal moral principles that could lead to justice, while Foucault saw morality and justice as shaped by historical and social power dynamics.",

        "body": "They're both ex-communists who have lost faith in Communism and the USSR and going about how to deal with it in a different manner. Chomsky still holds to Enlightenment framework that Socialism and Marxism also held, but he doesn't have a system to replace Capitalism, but he still knows that European Colonialism, and the American dominated system that replaces it are bad, he just doesn't have a replacement for them. So he focuses on just criticizing everything until something better comes out. \n\nFoucault went in the other direction, both losing faith in Communism and losing faith in Enlightenment framework as well, so his critiques go much deeper. So he also rejects science, claims of objectivity, as well as liberalism and capitalism. There is significant overlap, merely debating on how FAR the conspiracy by the bourgeois goes: is it merely capitalism and thus politics, or does it extend to culture and society with things not traditionally considered part of the conspiracy like education? Chomsky thus represents the \"Old Guard\" socialists, and Foucault the New Guard: anti-Soviet, anti-enlightenment. \n\nThe meta is more interesting and needs to be analyzed before you even get into the nitty gritty of everything else. There's no way that Foucault's focus on Psychiatry can be divorced from his homosexuality for instance. His loss in faith in systems such as science are because at the time science was used as a means to demonize homosexuality and declare it a mental illness. \n\nBoth are very negative ideologies reacting to the failures of the ideologies they grew up on, and both wish to critique systems, and both don't really have anything to replace it with. This kind of negative ideology can result in endless lectures and essays, and \"discourse\", but you can't live like this and you can't do anything in the real world without a positive agenda.\n\nNote: I'm actually using some framing and techniques Foucault uses - ideas are historically contingent. Somehow he felt that he could write these grand narratives and none of this applies to himself? If you tone down some of his conclusions, it's not crazy to look at the human aspect and sociological conditions that brings about concepts. It doesn't make them invalid, just gives context, and points to potential reform if they're having issues.",

Almost all he does is take individual words Chomsky uses to express a point, and strip them of context in order to problematize their use without ever engaging the point they were used to make.\n\nPerhaps the “debate” setting makes me view this style less generously than I should because they clearly don’t treat it as a debate, but that kind of non-engagement with specificity doesn’t make for interesting conversations whether or not they’re adversarial.\n\nMost of his objections about language (that our capacity for it resides in social forms, and not in our genetic endowment) has proven flat out wrong, and everything he has to say about historical contingency in science was argued much, much more substantively by Thomas Kuhn.",

Here's the abstract:\n\n>How should we approach the question of whether large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT possess concepts, such that they can be counted as genuinely understanding what they’re saying? In this talk, I approach this question through an inferentialist account of concept possession, according to which to possess a concept is to master the inferential role of a linguistic expression. I suggest that training on linguistic data is in principle sufficient for mastery of inferential role, and thus, LLMs trained on nothing but linguistic data could in principle possess all concepts and thus genuinely understand what they’re saying, no matter what it is about which they’re speaking. This doesn’t mean, however, that they are conscious.  Following Robert Brandom, I draw a distinction between sapience (conceptual understanding) and sentience (conscious awareness) and argue that, while all familiar cases of sapience inextricably involve sentience, we might think of (at least future) LLMs as genuinely possessing the latter without even a shred of the former.",

It's not emptiness, nor is it quite something concrete yet. It's more like an infinite ocean of \"what could be.\"\n\nBut potential, no matter how infinite, isn't reality—not until something happens. Reality sparks into existence when potential interacts with itself for the very first time, forming relationships. The first relationship transforms infinite possibility into something real, tangible, meaningful. From this point, relationships continue branching outward, intertwining, evolving into increasingly stable patterns—patterns we eventually recognize as things, identities, or even consciousness itself.\n\nIn this view, what we call \"things\"—like matter, energy, space, time, and consciousness—aren't fundamental building blocks at all. Instead, they are relational patterns stabilized through continuous interactions. Space and time emerge as frameworks formed by these patterns; energy becomes how we describe the unfolding and transformation of relational potential.\n\nThis relational story means that reality isn't just out there waiting to be discovered—it's constantly becoming, reshaped through every interaction and choice. It suggests that existence itself is a creative act, continually actualizing infinite possibilities into something meaningful.\n\nCould it be, then, that each of us is participating in the ongoing creation of reality, moment by moment, relationship by relationship, forever exploring the infinite potential from which everything arises?\n\nPerhaps what we call the speed of light and why it remains constant at every frame of reference is because it's the limit at which potential can be collapsed into coherence.",

We are stuck inside our own experiences of the world, but each of us can be sure we are experiencing it. Our behaviors and actions have a direct, physical, effect on the reality we inhabit. Whether that physicality is ultimately *real* or not does not change the fact that, if I trip and fall, I hurt myself.\n\nSo I tend to find myself skeptical in general, but not of reality, but of claims that there is some other explaination for this that I can adopt. My skeptical stance is to reject claims that my experience is in no way indicative of reality unless there is some evidentiary reason to do so. My perception of that reality must always be flawed, but that does not mean that my flawed perception does not correspond to an external reality, and it is by far the easiest and most useful assumption to just believe that said reality exists. What form it takes in its uttmost truth is ultimately both impossible for me to grasp and only the first step in explaining reality. \n\nIn simple terms, my experience is of a consistent external reality that affects me. To overcome that experiential evidence, I would need more than \"you can't prove it.\" There is no such thing as a piece of evidence that absolutely proves anything ever, it can only make it, as you said, the best explaination.\n\nAnd if I tried to live in a way that was consistent with unevidenced claims of solipsism, it would either drive me to complete depression or cause me to die in a myriad of horrible ways. So why accept the worst explaination if it does nothing for me?",

However, several issues remain.\n\nFirst, the appeal to simplicity assumes that RWH is less complex than SHs, but complexity depends on how explanatory entities are individuated. A well-formulated SH, such as an optimized simulation hypothesis, could be equally or more parsimonious. Without a clear metric for cross-ontological complexity, the advantage of RWH is uncertain.\n\nSecond, the claim that we can be “sufficiently certain” of RWH does not address the deeper challenge of radical skepticism, which questions not just the degree of certainty but the very framework of epistemic justification. If the skeptic demands a non-circular justification for inference to the best explanation, the argument risks presupposing what it seeks to prove.\n\nThird, the selective rejection of SHs raises a demarcation problem. If some SHs, like the simulation hypothesis, merit serious consideration while others are dismissed as speculative, the criteria for distinguishing viable from non-viable SHs need clarification.\n\nFinally, the argument assumes the reliability of logical and probabilistic reasoning, but radical skepticism directly challenges this assumption. If an SH entails cognitive unreliability, any argument against skepticism becomes epistemically self-undermining. Addressing this issue requires more than an appeal to pragmatic inevitability.",

You'd have to begin with a strict phenomenological comparison just to have any confidence that your notion of complexity isn't biased, and even then, what complexity itself *is*, and how to measure it, is ontologically dependent.\n\nThe real problem with the SH examples provided is just that they each begin with a conclusion, an ontological position, and work backward to justify its plausibility. We know that's a poor way to reason, orthodoxical or not. And that's precisely where valid skepticism of the RWH enters the scene.\n\nThe RWH ontology is derived from inferences foundationed on phenomena(sense perceptions), which it then infers are imperfect representations of its own truths—often mislabeled as reality—inverting its own epistemological order and thereby creating a kind of epistemic closure around its ontological position. That's the fundamental mistake in the Western worldview, which phenomenology has been hacking away at since Husserl (since, at least, Kant, really, in a deeper survey of the intellectual history).\n\nThe reason we can never settle on an ontological position is that there are two ontological orders in near exact opposition, and the wrong one has been wildly productive: the order of truths, where facts explain our ability to know; and the order of evidence, where our ability to know explains those facts. What most idealist strains have wrestled with, what physicalism seeks to sweep under the rug, is that the order of truths must be subsumed by the order of evidence, not the other way around; a true ontology IS an epistemology.\n\nYou get your renowned Stephen Hawking's searching for a theory of everything, but really they haven't even gotten so far as to understand the question (of what sort of theory that would be). Then you've got your Edgar Morin's who understand the question very well but can't get even as far as to explain it to a large enough community in order to make significant headway. And the world keeps marching on with its untenable ontology simply because motivation informs methodology and methodology informs ontology and our overwhelming motivation, for at least the past 500 years, has been simply to have a semblance of certainty and thereby applicability (i.e. technological progress).",

So a pre-registered experiment assessed how reflective thinking relates to decisions about 10 thought experiments from epistemology, ethics, and philosophy of mind. Participants from the United States were recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk, CloudResearch, Prolific, and a university. One participant source yielded up to 18 times as many low-quality respondents as the other three. Among remaining respondents, some prior correlations between reflective and philosophical thinking replicated. For example, reflection predicted denying that accidentally justified true beliefs count as knowledge. However, reflection test order did not impact philosophical decisions. Instead, a philosophical reflection effect emerged: making philosophical decisions before the reflection test improved reflection test performance. These and other data suggest causal paths between reflection and philosophy can go both directions, but detecting such results can depend on factors such as data quality.",

In some papers, Hofmann uses lower, primitive animals as examples of his idea - animals with very primitive perceptual abilities that you could very easily explain as evolving for some very pragmatic reason rather than \"truth\" reasons. But I think some people would argue that these perceptions are reliable and sufficient for \"truth\" in some sense by mapping to something out in the world consistently. And maybe we can see this in our own perceptions; physics and chemistry tells us that there are molecular structures out there that we cannot see for one reason or another - does that mean that what we can see from the world is not veridical? Not necessarily, imo, and a lot of people I think hold the view that our perceptions can be accurate or \"true\" even though we don't see atoms. My intuition is a lot of people's standard for \"true perception\" is probably a lot lower than what is implied by Hofmann. And then again, as other people point out, its hard to make sense of an evolutionary account of perception without some veridical component - if survival depends on navigating an actual objective world in a specific way (e.g. taking in nutrients), then surely your perceptual experiences have to be sufficiently veridical. It seems very unlikely that your actions can cause the desired objective events to come together without your perceptions being able to accurately identify objective stimuli, and (perhaps mostly for humans and other intelligent animals) identifying your own actions as objective events, and what their objective consequences are. Sure, maybe there are many different ways you can perceive or categorize or be sensitive to structure in the world - that may even be seen as emerging from specific kinds of object-subject interactions rather than pure unmediated perceptions of things in the world - but as long as what you see maps reliably to the world, at least in some limits, this seems like veridicality to me. Maybe you can think of stronger versions of veridicality, but then it rarely seems that there is unambiguous dichotomies of true or false, veridical or un-veridical. There are kind of blurred lines and gradations; and if you are forced to pick between two options - true or false, real or not real - there is a lot of wiggle room to plant your flag.  \n\n&nbsp;  \n\n[Edited for clarity]",

        "body": "I think both perspectives are true, or at least, not entirely inconsistent with one another. (I am new here and my background is psychology not philosophy, so please forgive me if I get some stuff wrong here.)\n\nYes, survival of organisms requires a somewhat accurate representation of the world around them. Knowing what, where, and who things are is critical for survival. (That’s not a rock, that’s my sibling. Or, that’s not my sibling, that’s my lunch.) Organisms *require* a sensory and perceptual approximation of reality in order to survive. But it is just an approximation because of the physical limits of sensory systems as well as the limits of processing capacity of the brain. \n\nHowever, those sensory and perceptual abilities never provide a *perfect* representation of reality for a few reasons. \n\n>Indeed, one can use the mathematics of evolutionary game theory to prove that the probability is zero that any sensory system reports the truth about any of a wide variety of structures that reality might have.\n\nThis strikes me as not particularly difficult to prove, but also it is not fair to say that our consciousness representation of reality is entirely inaccurate. It’s too strict to say that sensory systems need to produce a 100% depiction of truth/reality, otherwise they can’t actually represent reality at all. \n\n1. Limits to sensory systems: Sensory systems are not capable of detecting all information about reality, and so are inherently incapable of providing the entire truth of reality. Take for instance the ability of bees to detect ultraviolet light and snakes to detect infrared light. These are part of the electromagnetic spectrum that people just cannot detect. For humans, the ability to see beyond what we call the “visible spectrum“ was not important for our survival. For bees UV light guides them to flowers, particularly the central part that contains pollen—a food source. For snakes, infrared light allows them to detect prey even when no external light source is present. Humans are inherently incapable of constructing a perfect representation of reality due to the limits of sensory systems.\n\nThis is just an example, but there are LOTS more examples.\n\n2. Limits to processing capacity. Limits to processing capacity can be at both a sensory level and a perceptual level. \n\n2a. Some sensory systems decline in activation overtime to the same unchanging stimulus. When nothing about reality has changed, the nervous system diminishes its responsiveness over time, because the nature of the stimulus is no longer salient. The nervous system shifts its response away from a perfect depiction of reality and instead toward only information that signals a *change* in reality. This is called habituation and an example of this would be when we eventually become “used to” certain bodily sensations over time. If my partner touches my arm when we’re watching TV, my receptors respond, and I take notice. The longer his hand remains on my arm, the less my receptors send signals to my brain, and I notice it less. However, nothing has changed about the input, only the response of my nervous system. My receptors only fire again when he moves the position of his hand. \n\n2b. Limits to perception mean that the brain makes approximations about the world based on certain heuristics, or short cuts, which can include context, past events, the likelihood of an occurrence, etc. An example of this would be why we never actually notice our blind spot. The retina has a location that is “blind” in that it contains no photoreceptive cells (everyone has this and it’s needed to allow the optic nerve to exit the eye and connect to the brain). But people almost never notice this because the brain fills in the gaps using contextual information. Only when a specific demonstration is used, do folks ever notice their blind spots. \n\nSo yeah, we kind of do create useful fictions and I would agree that those fictions do have an evolutionary advantage in that they save time and energy, allowing the brain to generate the most likely scenario, and guide behavior accordingly.\n\nBut these scenarios (or fictions) are not entirely fabricated. They are based on reality and not even loosely based. Our nervous systems give us the best approximation of reality insofar as that reality has been critical to our survival. \n\n(I hope I haven’t misunderstood or misconstrued anything. I appreciate the opportunity think about these things. Thanks for reading this far.) ",

The article's example of Thucydides’s Melian Dialogue uses not just power, but the continued accumulation of power, as the core realist philosophy when dealing with international relations. However, this line of thinking leads to the implicit belief that power and justice cannot coexist, which is one of the founding principles of communism. Power, at least in international relations, is a zero-sum game due to its relative nature; one cannot gain power without another, comparatively, losing it, and it is also not possible to maintain justice without the backing of a powerful entity or entities, as history has proven since time immemorial. In the end, Sparta emerged victorious over Athens, but that is only further proof that justice by itself is meaningless without power, and that overwhelming power eventually becomes justice itself. Idealism inevitably gives way to realism.\n\nThus the saying goes: history is written by the victors. Perhaps not in a literal sense, but the meaning does arise from the concept above. When you cannot have justice without power, justice itself is meaningless. It is only through power that justice may manifest. This is the founding principle of democracy: no matter how powerful a ruler may be, it is the people who have the power to elect or depose him or her. A meticulous and dangerous balancing act.",

Sparta used Athenian overreach to frame itself as a righteous alternative, and used that to catapult its offensive against Athens.

These days however, with globalism and industrialized economies, even mighty nations rely on trade partners and allies to make up for weaknesses or inefficiencies that allies might be able to cover more efficiently, and to allow the projection of their power worldwide. Actually UTILIZING their power though, corrodes their alliances long-term, as nobody likes having a foreign power enforce their will on you, no matter what form that takes, and people don't forget.

In this sense, meaning is not a property of the sentence and is very context specific. \n\nFor example, would you understand the sentence “It is raining, but I don’t believe it is raining” in the same way if it were a line of dialogue in “The Matrix?” Clearly not, because in this context there is a related, implied proposition not stated: “it can appear to be appear to be raining.” This is a classic example of the kind of “commonsense reasoning” problem that bedevils AI researchers but is trivially easy for the human mind. Given everything we know about the modal fictions of the movie “The Matrix” our minds immediately understand the sentence, “It is raining, but I don’t believe it is raining” to mean “it appears to be raining, but I don’t believe it is raining.” In this context the sentence is clearly meaningful. ",

Making beliefs about thoughts (rather than propositions etc) is the unusual part of the definition this article proposes, and to not spend any time justifying it at all or considering alternate definitions that replace \"thought\" with \"proposition\" seems odd.\n\nMore serious problems appear in the final section about Moore's paradox. The text asserts that \"I believe that it is raining\" = \"It is raining.\" But that should not be the case at all based on everything that preceded this section! The sentence \"I believe that it is raining\" is (per the article) about the subjective mental states of the person to whom the pronoun \"I\" refers, while the sentence \"It is raining\" is about an objective state of affairs in the world (the fact of actual precipitation). They do not necessarily have the same truth value, and cannot possibly have the same meaning.\n\nAnother major problem follows immediately in the next sentence \"Therefore, if you say that it is raining, you must also believe that it is raining.\" But this is obviously not the case! People can and regularly do say things they do not believe. That's just lying: asserting something one does not believe to be true. If the article's definition of \"belief\" is such that lying is rendered impossible by definition, then that definition is just not viable.\n\nA technical problem appears in \"If a statement contains a contradiction (both P and -P), then the statement is meaningless.\" If a statement says \"P and not P\" then (presuming P is truth-apt) it's _false_, not meaningless. This is just the law of non-contradiction.",

        "body": ">If everyone has a different, subjective, interpretation of what a statement means, then the statement doesn’t convey a thought.\n\nUnder some interpretations, that would mean no statements have ever conveyed any thoughts.\n\nSentences can be communicative (\"the thief ran that way\"), or they can be summaries of people's thoughts (Alice thinks the thief ran that way), and most of the time those two purposes lead to similar sentences when written down, but don't confuse them. When we try to infer the meaning of a sentence, we're trying to figure out what the author was trying to communicate, and sometimes we're trying to figure out what the author was trying to communicate _about_ someone else's mental state, but either way there's communication involved.\n\nHuman communication simply doesn't work like that, in that strictly logical style many philosophers tend to get stuck on. Read Wittgenstein, read Grice, read Shannon, read about rational speech acts. When I say \"I believe it's snowing\" that's different from saying \"it's snowing\" - otherwise the verb \"believe\" would be useless (even adding hypothetical 100% useless words, or pauses, leads to subtly different meanings). It doesn't need to be so for any special reason related to the words themselves, but because whatever listener is hearing my words immediately and unconsciously infers what parts of my decisionmaking led to my word choices. So, usually, \"I believe\" preemptively weakens whatever statement you're making, lowers confidence, or emphasizes that you're talking about the mental state rather than the truth value.\n\nSo something like \"it's raining but I don't believe it's raining\" could be interpreted as \"I wanted to say something false and picked this sentence for some reason\" (unlikely), or e.g. \"I know it's raining but don't really (emotionally / deeply) believe it\" or something like that. It's not hard, we do it all the time.",

        "body": "Your analysis of belief is interesting, but I think you are imposing structure on a concept that is far more fluid in practice. While your definition of belief as a \"truth-giving\" relationship between a thinker and a thought is clear, it assumes that belief functions in a structured and deliberate way. However, belief is often messy, contradictory, and unmoored from logical consistency. People believe things emotionally, habitually, and unconsciously without necessarily assigning a formal truth value.\n\nMoore’s paradox is only paradoxical if we assume belief is a deliberate, rational assignment of truth. But people frequently hold beliefs and doubts simultaneously. I can say \"I know I am capable, but I do not believe I am capable,\" and this would not be meaningless to me—it would express a genuine tension between reason and emotion. This contradiction is not an error, nor does it make the statement meaningless. It just reflects the way human minds operate.\n\nYour argument seems to take a deflationist approach to truth, which is fine, but it does not necessarily follow that Moorean sentences are meaningless. You argue that if a statement has multiple interpretations, it has no objective meaning, but that standard would make most language meaningless, as all language depends on interpretation. A Moorean sentence is not meaningless; it just reveals the fractured nature of belief and cognition.\n\nUltimately, your definition of belief is useful as a framework for logical analysis, but it is too rigid to capture the reality of human belief. It assumes belief is an intentional act of truth assignment rather than an emergent and often incoherent process. In that sense, I think Moore’s paradox is not a paradox of belief but a paradox of expecting belief to be rational.",

So 'I believe that it is raining' = 'It is true that it is raining' = 'It is raining.' \"\n\nNo. This implies statements about one's own beliefs are semantically equivalent with statements about mind-independent objects, and vice versa.\n\nThat is not literally the case, even though \"I believe that p\" (and similar expressions, like 'probably, p') are often used as hedging devices to update the common ground with p.\n\nThe relationship between 'p' and 'I believe that p' is rather the \\*expression\\* relation. Believing that p is a normative assertibility condition for sincerely stating 'p.' In other words, you ought to believe that p as a precondition for sincerely claiming 'p.' That doesn't mean those sentences literally have the same meaning -- they don't. It does mean that from hearing someone sincerely assert 'p,' you can reasonably gather that they believe that p.\n\nIn that light, 'p, but I don't believe that p' \\*actually asserts\\* a pair of logically consistent statements.\n\nThe sense in which it \\*seems\\* contradictory is harder to explain.\n\nAllowing \\*expression\\* to be the relation between a proposition p and what it is to believe p (independent of a believer), define \\*practical entailment\\* as the relation between what a speaker says, and what you can practically conclude about their beliefs / mental states. In other words, John's assertion of 'p' practically entails 'John believes that p' iff 'p' expresses belief that p.\n\nNow, here's the paradox redux: why does 'p, but I don't believe that p' seem like a contradiction?\n\nThe assertion of the first part by a speaker S practically entails the content that S believes that p, while the second part contradicts that content. Hence, a Moorean paradox is any instance in which one part of an assertion practically entails a content which contradicts the literal content of another part of the same sentence.\n\nNotice that this is \\*not\\* the same as plain old contradiction: when a statement asserts contradictory contents.\n\nHence:\n\n\\*\\*Plain old contradiction:\\*\\* a person asserts contradictory contents: a & \\~a\n\n\\*\\*Moorean paradox:\\*\\* a person asserts a content (a), the assertion of which practically entails a different content (b) which contradicts another content they assert (\\~b).",

        "body": "Just to emphasize a thing or two, 1. for anyone that can't be bothered to read the article, and 2. for some things that I think are underemphasized:\n\nMemory isn't a single, monolithic thing. It's made up of interacting systems and types of memory, some of which are more stable vs the more malleable ones. E.g., procedural (skills and habits) and semantic (facts and general knowledge) memory are distinctly *more* stable and resistant to change over time by our own internal forces (though are still able to update of course, and can be pulled by misinformation). However, episodic (memories of events) and working memory (temporary storage while in active use) are much more easily influenced by a number of variables both inside and outside. \n\nParticularly, autobiographic memory, a specific part of episodic memory that focuses on our own life story, can be influenced by emotions, current beliefs, external narratives, and can be reinterpreted again and again based on new perspectives.\n\nAs the article states, memory isn't the only part of you that composes your sense of self. Personality is another significant factor: though generally *less* permanent and unchangable that most people think (though I would add not *only* altered by traumatic brain injury or diseases like dementia), personality is in general extremely stubborn and enduring. It's more like a way of orienting to the world and to the self. \n\nHowever, the article misses \"values\" as a significant part of the self. This one really stuck out to me (my field is clinical psychology). Values are extremely enduring, can guide behavior in powerful ways, and when people do not live their values, can lead to suffering.\n\nThe article, moreso the title, can give the impression that identity and reality are *completely fluid* things that simply fall through us like a siev. But I think that's a bit sensationalist. We are imperfect meat computers to be sure, but it's not quite so dire as that. Self, personality, and values are *relatively* enduring things.\n\nI also caution the use of the word truth here. Yes the article is making this point, but I'm being particular here. We are talking about experience, not truth, which I think most people already understand is subjective (even if they are confident about some particular aspect). It just urks me to see \"truth\" used this way, even for teaching. \n\nAnd a recco: Linda Zagzebski has some interesting writing on continuity in self being a key aspect of knowing who we are.\n\nAlso, Descartes meditations on first philosophy, of course.",

        "body": "The unreliability of memory (or the fact that our oldest memories are stories of stories of stories) does not make reality fluid, it makes observer perception fluid, because there is a difference between the subjective sense/perception/interpretation of reality, and objective reality. There is a difference between stories we tell ourselves about reality, and reality itself.\n\nAlfred Korzybski said [“the map is not the territory\"](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map–territory_relation), words and symbols are an abstract overlay on top of an underlying concrete reality. Alan Watts said “the menu is not the meal.” A description of how an orange tastes is meaningless to someone who has never directly experienced the taste of an orange. Alan Watts said “Words can be communicative only between those who share similar experiences.”\n\nIdentity is a story that you tell yourself (and that society tells you from infancy), but that’s doesn’t make truth a “shifting story.” Stories shift because symbolic language does not have to refer to concrete reality. As an abstract overlay of reality, language does not have to conform to physical reality (which can lead to delusions enabled by language).\n\n[Charles Tart](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Tart) said everyone is born into the “consensus trance” of the culture surrounding them, every individual is immersed in it, it washes over them.\n\nAlan Watts said “We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own. For we think in terms of languages and images which we did not invent, but which were given to us by our society.”\n\nRobert Anton Wilson said “Reality is what you can get away with.” But that doesn’t mean that your beliefs (or memories) can alter fundamental truths about reality. If it cannot happen then it’s not realistic. So you cannot do things that violate physical laws of the universe.\n\nThat is in contrast to people like Norman Vincent Peale, who wrote the self-help book The Power of Positive Thinking (1952), who wrote \"Affirm it, visualize it, believe it, and it will actualize itself.\" Compare that to New Age people who talk about “manifesting” their wishes, wants, and desires. People cannot use “The Secret”/“Law of Attraction”/wishful thinking to “manifest” healthy teeth if they do not brush or floss their teeth. People cannot wish away scurvy if they have a Vitamin C deficiency.\n\nThe title of this post reminds me of the woo woo film [What The Bleep Do We Know?](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Bleep_Do_We_Know!%3F) (2004), which focuses on a single theme: \"We create our own reality.\"\n\n>Bleep was conceived and its production funded by William Arntz, who co-directed the film along with Betsy Chasse and Mark Vicente; all three were students of Ramtha's School of Enlightenment…established in 1988 by J. Z. Knight, who claims to channel a 35,000-year-old being called Ramtha the Enlightened One. The school's teachings are based on channeling sessions. Critics consider the organisation to be a cult.\n\nAnd some people believe the “self” is an illusion. The atheist Sam Harris believes in “non-self”, which is taught in Buddhism. Wikipedia says:\n\n>In Buddhism, the term anattā…is the doctrine of \"non-self\" – that no unchanging, permanent self or essence can be found in any phenomenon.\n\nAnd Sufis in Islam speak about [ego death](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death) or Fana — https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fana_(Sufism) — annihilation of the self, “to die before one dies.” Various drugs have been reported to induce ego death, including a 0.4mg/kg intravenous dose of DMT.",

That's it.\n\nBut you can always ask… okay, but why should we be rational in the first place? Why should we use logic to decode/interpret reality? The obvious answer is: because we observe that people who follow these principles are more successful in life, tend to have better predictive power, understand phenomena better, invent and discover and do amazing stuff etc.  \nThis is why we say, \"there are good reasons to do what they do—to be rational agents and thinkers.\"\n\nBut this statement (which, to be clear, I 100% subscribe to) presupposes the acknowledgement of the existence of conscious entities, or at least thinking/computing entities, observers, and empirical experience—rational observers who behave and reason according to the dictates of logic, succeed in thier tasks, and observer that observe this very phenomena.\n\n**So you can't turn it around and say**, \"Ok, cool, ***so now we are going to start with logic axiomatically***, this is the way to be rational\" ***and then go backward to show that this is how the world must be*** (no observers and thinkers, just atoms and laws).\n\nThis is a circular trap, a trap into which countless philosophers and scientists and people have fallen and continue to fall.\n\nYou are always bound to presuppose observers and agents and ***everything had constituted the conditions that convinced you in the first place to think that using logic to decipher reality was a good thing,*** a useful tool with which to proceed.\n\nYou are always bound, at least, to this fundamental empirical experience.",

Scientific bias and subjectivity change nothing about the categories such claims belong to, they just make it harder to assign a truth value to the statement. \n\nYou blab quite a bit about science as if fact-value distinction depended on science being the \"facts\" side of the inequality. It is in fact independent of the way we evaluate the facts, it's just a way in which human logic/language works. \n\nYou also don't get values; you examples criticize the idea of morality being subjective by pointing to moral relativism. Those are not the same. Morality being subjective is a simple  acknowledgement of the reality of people all having different moral codes, moral relativism is the idea that all moral codes are equally as valid in a normative sense, or should apply locally. It's completely normal to both believe in subjective morality and think your morality is the one everyone should follow. Why wouldn't it be, if you actually believe in it, you'd want everyone to cooperate with you to bring it about.\n\nOne of your arguments seems to be that believing in the fact-value distinction would bring about negative consequences, therefore we should ditch it. This argument is intellectually bankrupt, but I can see how you can arrive at it if you already abandoned the fact-value distinction.",

Pragmatically, it doesn't matter much, because we have many instrumental good reasons to keep our probability estimates accurate, e.g. we can swap out different utility functions to think about what other people would do.\n\nOther than that, this discussion is very much muddled by activist scientists and their journo friends pretending they're more objective than they are (or the opposite), due to politics. It's clear that science as a process is neutral and truth-seeking for obvious objective reasons; it's also clear that you can't trust that people are doing the process instead of doing something else just because they tell you they did.

        "body": "There are theories in psychology that elaborate on this idea in a more sophisticated way. One example is Inner Family Systems.\n\nThe idea there is to treat sub-personalities under the main psyche as entities that can become damaged and disregulated. At the same time, it treats those sub-personalities as ultimately well-intentioned. There is also a hierarchy of “intelligence” of these sub-personalities, and the end goal is unity and self-reflection by the detached “over-self”.\n\nSo for instance, say you have an addiction to a harmful behavior, like overeating. The disordered person identifies themselves with their overeating, treating as an aspect of their “truest self”. But in IFS, you would say this person has been taken over by one of their “childlike-selves”. A different disordered person hates themselves because of their overeating, but this is also a less helpful approach. Instead, the child-like self that compels overeating is seen as reacting to a need that is not being addressed by the greater, “parent selves”. Like a real child, the “hungry self” isn’t intelligent enough to solve problems or communicate effectively, but it can act out in response to an unmet need.\n\nHowever, what’s key in IFS is that this is not a democracy. It’s a “family”. The healthy person is the head of their many selves. They know to take counsel from their better selves, “morality”, “purpose”, “rationality”, while managing the needs of the inner children, “stress”, “hunger”, “boredom”, “fear”. The inner children, if allowed to grow powerful enough to enforce their limited perspective, become addictions, compulsions, paranoias, and immaturity.\n\nSo no, not a “democracy”. A mental democracy implies a sense in which the different selves are true independent entities with their own rights. But that’s not the case, it’s only schizoid, narcissistic projection. Every self is you, they all want what’s best for the one you by their own definition, but fundamentally there is no sense in which your own parts have rights separate from your own. Indeed, a mental democracy fails for the same reason regular democracies do, the inner children are bad decision makers, prone to infighting. An enlightened perspective, foreign to self-hatred but with a firm hand, is the necessary leader of the bunch.\n\nThere is also a note in the article on “resisting aestheticism” (as if aestheticism was something so easy it needs to be resisted). It is put up as a variant of mere denial, but this is such a watering down of what aesthetic systems are about.\n\nYes, to an extent aestheticism is about self-control. Fasting, habit regulation, purposeful reflection, meditation, and prayer do strengthen the parts of the brain that regulate impulses and allow concentration. But that is such a small part of these practices. Any psychologist will tell you that merely repressing desires is doomed to fail due to the natural limits on human willpower.\n\nAesthetic practice is about reorientation. At its roots, the goal is to nurture a meaningful life through intentional focus. Its practices increase our sense of self-efficacy and replace negative habits with thoughtfulness. The goal is connection to the divine, self-understanding, and the release of irrational attachments. It is not mere prudishness for its own sake, or being a fake stoic buzzkill. \n\nNor is it self-violence; while the child self says “eat as much sugar as we want! It’ll be fun!”, a self capable of temperance avoids the glutton’s fate of overstimulation; for them, the single chocolate is rich and flavorful, special because the reward centers of brain haven’t been ruined by a heightened tolerance to dopamine. While individual hungers might be put to rest, the true aesthetic grows a source of inner contentment as they discover the true wants of the soul, ending the cycle suffering emerging from desire.",

But facing them doesn't mean self-punishment and suppression. It's more literal. Face them, stare at your flaws in the face, make no excuses, do not rationalize, recognize that they are and have mercy on them. Flaws are everywhere and inevitable, it's okay to have them.

Artificial food or intelligence is natural. The potential of wood becoming a mighty ship pre-exists in the natural characteristics of wood. Even the potential of art or fantasy pre-exists in the natural characteristics of the human mind. The potential of coding an extremely fun video game not yet released, pre-exists in the code used to create said video game. The potential of creating a code which in place can be used to create, pre-exists in the human mind.\n\nEven if you, arbitrarily, look at animals to set what \"natural\" is, you will see them manipulating matter for their benefit, like birds creating houses way before man did or beavers creating dams way before man did. You will even see them creating imaginary scenarios for pure entertainment, like when dogs pretend to fight each other or when monkeys literally troll each other and laugh about it.\n\nThe scale of matter manipulation or imagination, seems like an arbitrary and purely anthropocentric standard of what \"natural\" is. Me stepping on an ant colony and destroying it, is completely irrelevant to the human experience. Someone nuking my country and destroying it, is completely irrelevant to the Milky Way galaxy. Both those actions are destructive. Man or man creations cannot be unnatural, whatever the scale, because anything a man can do or think is part of nature. Something being unnatural cannot even be expressed.",

Mill has a pretty influential proposal here (from his three essays on religion): “what takes place without the agency, or without the voluntary and intentional agency, of man.” Basically, unnatural things are those that are influenced by human agency, and natural things are the rest.\n\nHere, Mill claims that the natural is what _takes place_ without the agency of man. He is concerned about a category of \"phenomena _produced by_ human agency.\" But when the author here rewords it to \"influenced by,\" the meaning is changed. Being influenced is a much weaker condition than being produced. Birds are certainly influenced by human agency, for example, but they were not _produced_ by human agency. And it seems more broadly that if we actually take Mill seriously and go back to \"takes place without\" rather than \"influenced by,\" most of the (real) problems mentioned in this blog post disappear.",

I am not a philosopher, but to me it'd seem righteous if we attempted to reduce inborn inequalities, not through elimination of people that are on the left end, but through enhancement of them, in order to bring them to the right of the curve, either through genetic technologies or other enhancing tech that might be invented in the future. We try to achieve the best for our children: we provide healthcare for them, we try to send them to the best schools, we try to inspire them to think about the world. All in all we want them to grow up in an environment that fosters their brain, because we want them to be capabale. But according to all respected research available, at least 50% and maybe up to 80%, of all intellectual traits that we so deeply care about and that are so essential to success in our modern society, are entirely decided by the genome.  \nTo me it seems obvious that genetic engineering is the next step in trying to reduce inequalities. I don't want to get into a debate about inequal distribution should that technololgy become a reality. I am from Germany, a country with universal healthcare, that would pay for such gene therapies should they arrive. You can argue that the inexistence of such system in your country would result in genetic technology increasing inequality instead of reducing it, but that is not an argument against the technology itself, but against the healthcare system that you currently live in.",

If you are interested in it, you, as a person, can decide to fall into the silicon valley vision for it, or you can follow it in your own best possible way.  \n\nI'm not a proponent of effective altruism because I've done enough acid to shift my world view away from it.  \n\nBut I was a proponent.  As a proponent, I'd just look at longtermerism and go \"lol no.\"  Nobody's putting a gun to my head to justify why I'm not donating money to shooting down asteroids.  I'm not trying to make a living streaming debates or lobbying billionaires.  I'll do good my way with my understanding of good.  End malaria or river blindness or other similar scourge.  If i guess wrong about which one is The Most Good, someone else will guess in a different direction, and it's better to take some action than suffer analysis paralysis.  \n\nSo from there, we have the billionaire philanthropists using it for their whims.  We would have them anyways.  They'd come up with ways to justify their whims regardless.  That's not a fault of EA having to governing body.  If it had one, and it mattered, those same billionaires would be on its board.  \n\nIf that board was incorruptible, they'd start their own competing board and market the shit out of it.  \n\nIf that didn't work, they'd label themselves Optimal Altruists.  \n\nAnd so on.  Look how well checks and balances are doing at stopping billionaires from doing as they please in the white house right now.  That's not the fault of effective altruism.  That's the fault of people with power exercising it.  \n\nSimilarly: I'm not Christian, but I was raised that way.  I wouldn't use Trump and Elon claiming Christian values as a reason to disparage the teachings of Christ.  I'd continue loving my neighbour as myself and do what I do have the power to do.  \n\nSimilarly: Whatever warped trail of logic led Hitler to being a vegetarian has not stopped me from also being a vegetarian.  Not hurting animals is obviously just the thing to do, and helping end malaria - if you have the power to do so - is obviously just the thing to do.  Effective altruism can lead one to both conclusions.  Or can lead one to the conclusion that they need to end the world while they sit pretty in a doomsday ark with 1000 beautiful women ready to repopulate when the ash settles.",

The author is completely ignoring a retort that she spent many, many paragraphs railing against.\n\nThat retort is: mentally unwell people. That's who would engage in risky, self-destructive behaviors that seem to defy rationality. She can't get around that retort, because there is a mountain of evidence that human beings *do* engage in risky, unproductive, and/or self-destructive behavior; it's not hidden behind the additional veil of self-identification. \n\n(As a brief tangent: it was quite odd to read her bring up Descartes in regards to the inherent validity of self-identification, but then completely ignore the troubling implications for anybody else looking at *her* and being radically skeptical that she's even real.)\n\nWe're even reluctant to attach the label of official mental illness to literally billions of people who stubbornly believe incorrect things (or at least utterly ridiculous but non-disprovable things) and make terrible choices based upon those beliefs. I'm sure the author could instantly identify roughly 77 million of them that are supremely relevant to multiple sections of this very article. As a somewhat more charitable example: why would anyone ever martyr themselves? Why would anyone ever engage in civil disobedience, only to get arrested, jailed, and possibly worse? Not everyone who goes through that is on the side of the angels. Martyrs exist for absolutely terrible movements that embrace both morally *and* factually suspect positions.\n\nAs surely as a Trump voter would be caught in an impossible situation if some supremely powerful person/group were to declare them \"a brainwashed idiot,\" trans people are caught in an impossible situation when they are told that \"trans-ness\" doesn't exist, and that they are simply mentally unwell.\n\nThe only difference between those two situations is that one is true and the other isn't... but who decides *that?* If Descartes is her only refuge besides an appeal to some authority, she's in a pretty bad position. I sympathize with it greatly, but that doesn't make her argument any better.\n\nAs to her big question about the ethical bounds of philosophy: if she were to apply her new ideas about restricting conversations fairly, then it would seem that philosophers would always be breaching an ethical rule by asking any questions about anything at all that attaches to any human individual or group in any way. As long as *someone* who might wish to join *any* conversation would be \"on their heels,\" then that would be due to an ethical breach by a philosopher.\n\nThat's awfully limiting, isn't it? Doesn't a simple *reductio ad absurdum* highlight just how limiting it is? Who gets to decide that putting serial killers on their heels in a philosophical debate is ethically acceptable, because *surely* it needs to be okay to ask the question of whether compulsively murdering a whole bunch of people over time is itself unethical or speaks to some kind of mental defect?",

These aren't fully argumented ideas, more personal notes I found insightful enough to share.\n\n**Deriving piety from nature, through the idea of no free will:**\n\nI don't believe in free will, as it can be logically derived from the law of the excluded middle: every mental event is either random or causal, leaving no room for true autonomy. It can’t be neither nor both as there is no way to make sense of something not random nor causal.\n\nWithout free will, blame and accountability lose their meaning; people act as they must, shaped by forces outside of their control.\n\nIf you lived according to that principle, you would transcend forgiveness. If no one is truly responsible for their actions, there is no one to forgive. From this perspective, compassion becomes the logical extension that naturally arises from seeing reality for how it is.\n\nThis insight stems from the law of the excluded middle (logic), causation/randomness, and the illusion of free will as developed by our evolution (observing the natural order).\n\nBy uncovering the reality of existence, one finds that living in accordance with it naturally leads to what we call \"goodness\". This is where piety is found. Not through scripture, but through the gospel of nature, including our human nature.\n\n \n\n**Living happily regardless of no free will:**\n\nIf one wishes to live a good life in a deterministic universe, one ought to accept the unavoidable nature of the universe but actively create meaning within it, unbound by societal expectations or herd morality. The acceptance of fate could be seen as not about giving up on action but about realizing that the will operates within the constraints of the universe, where the forces outside one's control shape outcomes. In this sense, freedom becomes the ability to act with full engagement despite knowing the outcome is shaped by those forces, to live authentically within a determined world.\n\nBe a true pessimist. See reality for what it is, and accept that you are radically free, yet caged at the same time. Focus on this feeling of freedom, as it will serve as a source of strength that you need to live a life worth living.\n\nMeditate on this duality.\n\n \n\n**Random short ideas (need to be expanded on later):**\n\nMimetic desires cause all the non-animalistic desires. Mimetic desire doesn't invalidate the desire itself or the pleasure that comes from fulfilling it. It’s just about being aware of their origin.\n\nMemento mori is embracing death denialism and using it to empower your will, rather than it undermining our will. Accept the natural course of life and death, and use it as energy. Wu wei.\n\nI'm just the observer of my thoughts, that all other attempts at defining oneself (name, age, what you like and dislike) aren't you. I'm a reflection of the universe, since everything I am goes through my senses, and my senses are built by evolution which exists only due to how the universe is.",

I’m reading a paper involving Mills, Frege, and Russell’s views of references.\n\nThe paper presents Frege’s “concern about identity statements” as:\n\n1a. My next door neighbor is our district representative.\n\n1b. a=b\n\n2a. My next door neighbor is my next door neighbor.\n\n2b. a=a\n\nThe paper presents this as a problem of “why, if identity statements are simply about their referents, are statements like 1a not as obvious as statements like 2a, which has the form 2b?”\n\nI’m not sure why this is a “concern” or “problem”. If I’m not mistaken, is 2a simply not a tautology? I get that 1a can change in the future (and become a≠b) but it’s currently true.\n\nThe paper goes on to refer to Frege’s distinction between sense and reference and how “Frege used the concept of sense to solve his problem with identity statements.”\n\nI’m sure I’m missing something, but I’m not really understanding what the “problem” is or why it requires a “solution” or why/how Frege’s “sense” solves it.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThank you.",

The **unity of synthesis** is necessary to form **concepts**.\n3. **Concepts** are necessary for the **functions of judgment**.\n4. The **functions of judgment** are used to **derive the categories**.\n\nThis leads to a potential **circle**: **Categories → Unity of Synthesis → Concepts → Functions of Judgment → Categories.**\n\n# Supporting Quotes from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (B Edition):\n\n1. **Categories enable the unity of synthesis:** “The same function which gives unity to the various representations in a judgment also gives unity to the mere synthesis of representations in an intuition, which is expressed generally as the pure concept of the understanding.” (B104-105)\n2. **Unity of synthesis is necessary to form concepts:** “The spontaneity of our thought requires that this manifold first be gone through in a certain way, taken up, and combined, in order for knowledge to arise. This act I call synthesis.” (B102-103)\n3. **Concepts are necessary for the functions of judgment:** “Understanding is the faculty of thinking, and thinking is knowledge through concepts.” (B93-94)\n4. **Categories are derived from the functions of judgment:** “The functions of the understanding can be completely discovered if one can present the functions of unity in judgments exhaustively.” (B94) “In this way, there arise just as many pure concepts of the understanding as there were logical functions in all possible judgments.” (B105)\n\nI'd appreciate any insights, critiques, or references to existing literature that discuss this issue.

For example take person wielding a stick - depending on the activity, the stick could be taken as a part of the person’s propensity for\nboth action and observation. What is the agent boundary?\n\n[Agency Is Frame-Dependent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.04403v1)\n\nIf we clearly state our frames of reference the mind-body problem might dissolve.\n\nMy own intuition about the mind-body problem is that there is a middle ground between 1st and 3rd person, and that is relational representation. Basically assume we have a new experience, e_n, we represent it in relation to all past experiences e_0, e_1,... e_n-1, and it adds itself to the list.\n\nThis generates a high dimensional space where proximity means semantic similarity. This approach bridges the gap because 3rd person data, when related to other prior data points, creates its own representational space with no external reference. The brain after all sits locked away in the skull with no direct access, just a few bundles of unlabelled nerves, it can't have intrisic knowledge, it can only relate and contrast its sensorial patterns. So this semantic space comes from experience data and is 1st person being based on the experience of one agent. It captures the qualitative aspects of qualia.\n\nOn the other hand, we have an output constraint - we can only act serially. Can't walk left and right at the same time, can't brew coffee before grinding the beans. So the brain has to (somehow) collapse that distributed neural activity into a serial stream of behavior. That can explain the unified feeling of consciousness.\n\nThe input constraint (experience judged in context of past experience) and output constraint (serial action bottleneck) bracket the brain with centralized semantics and behavior, while in the middle we have distributed activity.",

In other words, the \"reasons as explanation\" approach to normative reasons still retains the normativity of normative reasons. Accordingly, the contrast between normative reasons (\"the fact that a trusted expert says P is a reason to believe P\") and causal/explanatory reasons (\"the fact that the house was built out of flimsy materials is a reason why it fell down\") still stands. You can maybe think of this as \"reasons to/for\" vs \"reasons why\" (where the statement following \"why\" doesn't use normative terms). Perhaps there's a good way to reduce one to the other. But you haven't shown how or given any arguments why we should.\n\nAlso, I think you have grossly misunderstood what Wedgwood is talking about in the chapter you cite. The Reasons First program in metaethics seeks to treat normative reasons as the primitive type of normative notion. So, all other normative terms (\"value,\" \"ought,\" \"good,\" etc) are defined in terms or (normative) reasons, not the other way around.\n\nThe Reasons First program is NOT about saying that there is only one meaning for the word \"reason.\" After all, that is obviously false. Is it used the same way in \"Reason is and ought to be slave to the passions,\" \"I have good reason to call the police,\" and \"the fact that the barn door is open is the reason why the horses escaped\"? Drawing distinctions between the various ways a common word can be used (for example, between the normative and explanatory use of \"reason\") is one of philosophers' most basic moves. And it doesn't require \"family resemblances\" (also, I'm curious which philosophers you think invoke this with regard to reasons) or cowardice to notice that people use the same word in multiple ways that aren't necessarily related.",

Batman is not an objective thought independent of a mind, he's a fictional character that exist in people's minds as literal mush in their brains, on pages in comic books and on tape/electronic storage inside movies. He exists purely physically as those things, and is not mind independent. He exists in communication between people due to us being able to agree within a level of tolerance on certain details in our mental models of Batman, like the story, his looks, etc., originating from our cultural artifacts like the aforementioned comics and movies, but also fan material, toys, etc. All having a referent in reality. So Batman is only abstract in a weak sense, not the strong platonic one, as every aspect of him if you dig deeper has a referent in reality. He is only commonly understood in a behavioral way (we can agree to a certain extent what he is), not in a true fashion. \n\nSimilarly the example with a number is just a statement of a particular philosophical view (platonism), not an argument. A nominalist can simply say math is the product of rules (axioms), the choice of those axioms is arbitrary and their application is guided by logic, all of which can come from the mushy human brains and said brains can come to the same conclusions based on the same rules, because they're wired similarly. So this number in particular may not have existed, but the ruleset to crate it certainly did, and it's not a magical property of the universe, but just the human brain. A different ruleset can result in different objects and this is sometimes done in mathematics. Zermelo-Frankel set theory is just one system and we use it due to it mapping close to our intuitions and having certain desirable properties. \n\nWhen looking at those commonalities among different people's thoughts you assumed that they have to share an abstract object that predates their emergence instead of simply concluding that they come from similar minds operating on the same source material, thus creating such a pattern. This is a perfect place to apply Occam's Razor, and in fact it was conceived of to deal with a slightly different but related problem (universals). There is no need for true abstract objects that predate the mind, it can much more easily be explained by things we not only know exist for sure but could verify empirically (the material world).",

This means that time had an origin, a start, a very beginning. However, just because it had a start, doesn’t mean it didn’t exist at some point. Time was always present from the beginning. Here’s how. Nothingness is a no state. It lacks any thing at all. This leaves INFINITE potential for everything, doesn’t it? I mean nothingness is as open to being filled in as can be, so therefore it must… right? Yes! Reality cannot be forced to stop existing. For a force to keep existence from the nothingness nostate, that force itself IS existence, yet again confirming that existence has to happen. It’s totally necessary and unavoidable.

We craft an identity when any other thing is introduced to us or when we perceive things as separate from us. We have to be this thing because that other thing is that thing. Otherwise there is no need to think of yourself as anything.\n\nWhen we think of what really exists behind all that it's basically an unassuming, nonreacting, uncurious little ghost. It responds because it has senses and that gives it knowledge and it starts to behave accordingly. So the highest form of consciousness is knowing that you do not have a real personality or identity.

Jung was more focused on Christianity, and the knowledge in his time about Buddhism was not as advanced as in our current time.\n\nWhile Buddhism does emphasize the illusory and impermanent nature of mental phenomena, it doesn’t outright dismiss them. Instead, Buddhist practice involves observing these phenomena with detachment, recognizing their transient nature, and reducing their influence over one’s sense of self. The goal isn’t to reject mental contents but to change one’s relationship with them to achieve liberation from suffering.\n\nJung’s analytical psychology, on the other hand, takes a different approach. Rather than detaching from mental phenomena, it emphasizes engaging with them…. exploring their symbolic meanings to integrate different aspects of the psyche. (Integration, as some have mentioned). Individuation, in Jungian terms, is about harmonizing the various sub-personalities and archetypes within the unconscious to realize a more whole self. In contrast, Buddhism ultimately aims to dissolve the notion of a fixed self altogether.\n\nThat said, both perspectives take the mind seriously - they just approach it differently. Buddhism seeks to transcend identification with mental contents, while Jungian psychology seeks to work with them for personal development. If anything, Buddhism deeply respects the power of mental phenomena, treating them as something to be understood rather than ignored.\n\nRather than contradicting Jung’s view, the idea of multiple selves fits well… our various personas and unconscious drives interact constantly. Individuation, in Jung’s terms, isn’t about collapsing these selves into one but integrating them into a balanced whole. When the ego clings too tightly to one self-image and represses the rest, it creates inner conflict. The article suggests that embracing our many selves, rather than resisting them, leads to a more fluid and authentic identity - something Jung would see as essential for psychological wholeness.",

Their complex relationship, involving love, ownership, and trauma, provides insights into the contradictions and violence that animate our own behaviors and social relations. Additionally, they offer two archetypes for how one copes with the violence of society: Guts attempts to escape language and social hierarchy while Griffith attempts to master them. \n\nUltimately, *Berserk* presents a compelling exploration of desire, power, violence, and the struggle for self-determination within the constraints of the social and symbolic order.",

We know we are alive and know we will die. We also know we will suffer during our lives before suffering—slowly or quickly—as we draw near to death. This is the knowledge we “enjoy” as the most intelligent organisms to gush from the womb of nature. And being so, we feel shortchanged if there is nothing else for us than to survive, reproduce, and die. We want there to be more to it than that, or to think there is. This is the tragedy: Consciousness has forced us into the paradoxical position of striving to be unself-conscious of what we are—hunks of spoiling flesh on disintegrating bones.\n\n- Thomas Ligotti\n\nAlthough yes some philosophy gives hope but I don’t see it as an attempt to instil hope the way theology does, chiefly by promising rewards after death for good conduct.",

Once again, we are living in an age where God is an agent of the discourse of the master and his truth. A neoliberal horror story of control and subjugation.

From Descartes to Sartre, many philosophers have concluded that to be conscious is to be conscious of something and there can be no other self hiding within consciousness.

Your PSR states \"*all* contingent facts have reasons for their existence.\" One does not need to accept this to say that \"*some* contingent facts have reasons for their existence.\" One's acceptance of this weaker claim is enough to license giving reasons.\n\nThis is also relevant to the other argument you like to make against PSR skeptics: you present some absurd event and then claim that the skeptic is committed to denying that any explanation can be given for why that absurdity does not happen. The skeptic can respond by simply saying that *some* contingent facts have explanations. The absurd examples that you present don't happen because they contradict some law of nature, and that's the explanation. But this doesn't commit them to claiming that every fact has an explanation. Bearing a default assumption that most things will have explanations is good for inquiry, but this doesn't mean that one must accept the PSR.\n\nAlso, about the van Inwagen counterargument that the PSR entails necessitarianism, the problem here seems to be, not that this makes things bad for free will, but rather that the PSR is only vacuously true. It purports to tell us all contingent truths have a certain property. But there are no contingent truths (by necessitarianism), so the PSR is about as meaningful as \"all square circles have 4 sides.\"",

In fact, the whole reason we ask questions is to discover these underlying explanations, which we already *presume* to exist.\n\nCitation, please. And just who is this \"we,\" anyway?\n\nThis is where this article breaks; the presumption that I demand explanations for *everything* and an somehow incapable of shrugging my shoulders, saying: \"That is just how it is,\" and going on with my life.\n\nTrue, the author is also attempting to make this point for humanity as a whole, but I'm going to use myself as the example here, because this allows me to make the following challenge:\n\n**Prove it.** Prove to me that I *demand* and answer for everything that strikes me as true, and that I *always* presume such answers must exist. Not to your satisfaction, but to *mine*. (P.S.: And none of this \"your demand for evidence is proof of bad faith\" malarkey, either.)\n\nBecause what breaks this argument for me is smuggling in of psychology. When the author says:\n\n> People may *say* that the universe is fundamentally random and physical events lack true explanation, but they will still navigate through life by asking \"why?\" questions and would never accept \"just cuz its brute,\" as an answer.\n\nThen there is a \"why\" to this. In other words, the fact that \"people\" (and perhaps the author leaves themselves an out by never saying just *who* \"people\" are...) \"would never accept 'just cuz its brute,' as an answer,\" has a reason. So present it. Present to me the evidence that when someone tells me \"I should say that the universe is just there, and that's all,\" that I am fundamentally prevented from taking that at face value.\n\nSure, the author can simply *assert* that I am, and then attempt to move the burden of proof back to me, but I refuse to take it, in the same way that I refuse to take the burden of proof when some random person walks up to me and asserts \"You stole something from me, and now owe me $1,000.00.\"\n\nIf the author is going to make a truth claim about me, they should explain why it is true. The fact that they can't understand why it must be true of themselves, and even other people that they know, has no bearing on me.\n\n> You might try to argue that even though reasons against the PSR are self-defeating, there still *can be* contingent truths that lack an explanation, independent of whether or not we accept the PSR. We cannot be forced to accept the PSR just from clever equivocation.\n\nThis is where I basically walked away. A contingent truth cannot lack an explanation... *because having an explanation is definition of a contingent truth*. The author redefines \"truth\" to equal \"contingent truth,\" and then (I presume) merrily proceeds from there. *Tautology* and *axiom* are not synonyms.",

While truths can be contingent, it is dubious that facts can. (What does it even mean for a fact to be contingent? The usual possible-worlds account via modal logic gives no obvious answer.)\n\nWith this vagueness, it is entirely unclear what the author has in mind for the domains of X and Y in the PSR. Are X and Y statements? Are X and Y facts? Is X a fact and Y a statement?\n\nIf either X or Y are statements, the PSR must be restricted to the domain of second-order logic only, because it involves quantification over statements. The usual \"trick\" to reduce to first-order logic via an axiom schema does not work here, because the PSR as stated says something like \"there exists a statement...\" and you can't make that into an axiom schema. This makes PSR very dubious as a general law of logic or reasoning, because it can't even work in first-order logic: if we accept that we must always use this version of the PSR, it means we must abandon first-order logic, which would be extremely silly.\n\nOn the other hand, if both X and Y are meant to be facts, then it is totally unclear what it means for Y to be a sufficient condition for X. For _statements_ this relation is unambiguous: Y is a sufficient condition for X if Y entails X. But for facts, who knows? And even if we ignore this, if X and Y are both facts then the whole line of argument in the article falls apart, as that argument requires Y to be an _explanation_ and specifically _not_ a brute fact.",

        "body": "Summary:\n\n  \nSuffering and Human Nature:  \n\n\n* Nietzsche acknowledges the ubiquity of suffering in human life, a theme central to many philosophical and religious doctrines. He critiques how different worldviews interpret suffering — from Christianity's promise of an afterlife for salvation to the pessimistic views of philosophers who see life as fundamentally negative. \n\nThe Strong vs. The Weak:  \n\n\n* For Nietzsche, the strong see suffering as a challenge to be overcome, a test of their will. They affirm life, embracing both joy and pain as part of existence. Conversely, the weak succumb to suffering, often by complaining or seeking solace in narratives that justify or blame external factors for their plight. \n\nResentment and Complaining:  \n\n\n* Nietzsche introduces the concept of \"resentment\" (or ressentiment), where the weak, unable to change their circumstances, resort to complaining as a form of imaginary revenge. This act of complaining provides a temporary sense of power, alleviating but not solving the underlying issues. He specifically critiques Christians and anarchists, seeing their ideals of equality as masks for this resentment. \n\nPsychological Analysis:  \n\n\n* He argues that the weak invent value systems (like religious doctrines or social equality ideals) to cope with their powerlessness. These systems often preach equality not out of genuine belief in justice but as a way to level the playing field by pulling down the strong. This is a form of psychological self-deception, where the weak pretend to desire equality while secretly wishing to possess the power they criticize. \n\nLife Affirmation vs. Complaint:  \n\n\n* Nietzsche contrasts complaining with his ideal of life-affirmation. He introduces the thought experiment of eternal recurrence from \"The Joyful Science,\" where one must imagine living every moment of life, including its suffering, over and over. Affirming life in this context means loving every aspect, even the suffering, which requires immense psychological strength — an attribute of his concept of the Übermensch (Overman). \n\nConclusion:  \n\n\n* Nietzsche's philosophy suggests that complaining does not solve problems but rather reveals one's inability or unwillingness to face life's challenges head-on. Instead, he advocates for an active overcoming of obstacles, embracing life's hardships with a \"Yes\" to existence in all its forms, which he sees as the path to true power and self-mastery. This perspective is intended to push individuals towards a higher form of living, where one does not merely endure life but celebrates it. \n\nIn essence, Nietzsche's critique of complaining is not just about stopping the act but about transforming one's approach to life, from one of passive acceptance or resentment to active engagement and affirmation.",

It’s the ambitious that don’t complain because they don’t want to be judged, lest they might be denied achieving their desires. So, who are the strong? The ones that forfeit their desires so they can openly state their truth or the ones who forfeit their freedom of expression so they can have what they covet? There are plenty of examples of people seen as strong by the masses, but have begotten their perceived strength by sacrificing their authenticity.\n\n\nEDIT: And also, how is complaining separated from people just stating what they believe and being judged for it and marked as complainers?\n\nSociety will label people as it sees to its benefit. One moment one is a scion of truth, the other to be marked as asking too much from society.\n\nAnd what if one “complains” but at the same time faces their suffering head on? I believe separation of these concepts is sometimes very difficult and requires us to see things in black and white whereas reality is always-always seen and related as being infinite shades of gray.\n\n\nEDIT 2: Yeah, I choose to be resentful sometimes because it makes me feel good. Doesn’t mean I’m not accepting the world as it is.\n\nNietzche can have his cute little righteous purity of brave suffering but that’s just fake bravado. Life is shit and it feels great to be weak and take a weak shit on it sometimes. What of it? We can wipe our ass after, roll up our sleeves and do something about it while resenting it. The two can coexist and to not accept that is disingenuous.",

In my personal experience I have found that developing algorithms is a deeply introspective process that centers around asking the question \"how do I personally solve these problems?\" and then explaining my internal processes precisely enough for a computer to simulate them. From this experience I believe the abilities to plan a route, to understand language, and to do many forms of logic, all have at least a biological mechanism that is comparable to depth-first search and other graph theory concepts. Furthermore I have noticed that when I improve one of those abilities within myself, that always confers improvements to the others. The brain seems to be reusing that neural circuitry, or publishing improvements to various instances of that neural circuitry. Because of some nonsense to do with NP-completeness and how it relates to using graph theory to solve problems, I know this cannot be a total explanation of what's happening, but I do believe it is a good explanation of a lot of what's happening.\n\nI really like playing with quarterstaffs. One of the curious things I've noticed about them is that what allows you to control it is that where one motion ends, many others begin. This is another expression of graph theory that is equivalent to a finite automaton, so closely related to things like regular expressions. When I am performing a motion with my staff I have until the motion ends to decide which motion to perform next. In this way I am using a simplified description of the staff's motions to direct it. This lines up with my belief that logic, or symbolic reasoning, is actually a heuristic that we use to quickly reason about complex situations by exploiting patterns we've extracted from our observations.\n\nWhat interests me about logic is motivated by practical concerns: How closely does my heuristic model actually match reality? Do I need to worry about mismatches, or can I keep a guiding hand on what I'm doing to account for errors? Is my process something I can teach, or do I have to take the role of an auteur? If I must be an auteur to do something, will it be a huge problem that the bus factor is 1? All of this boils down to the ethical concerns I have about using The Engineer's Flippant Perspective On Epistemology(TEFPOE): If you used something to do something, then you used something to do something.",

I think the point about metaphysics, however, makes sense as an archaeological interpretation of how we have come to the position we have today more than it does an accurate picture of things as they now are.\n\nThe turn from metaphysics happens significantly further down the chain, when we come to understand that the plurality of the world outstrips the simple individual perspective. That is to say, the “psychologistic” view, that there is not one single true way to think but we develop new faculties as we grow and explore and test and refine and observe them in others, is right, and the idea of a single true metaphysics cannot withstand the desert of the real.\n\nBut this does not mean that logic has no foundation or even that such a foundation is only given by metaphysics and that logic therefore cannot function. What we have, rather, is **protocol** - similar to metaphysics but which is understood to be malleable and amenable to reframing, vulnerable to human bias and heuristic and thus potentially fallible, contextual and thus reflective of local differences of opinion and experience but equally revisable as part of the wider empirical paradigm of proposing models and submitting them to tests of operational effectiveness.\n\nLogic, too, can be understood as plural, in as much as it helps us navigate the modality of truth and consequence in the variations of protocol, and a skilful logician understands not just the rules within protocols but also both their commonalities and inter-operations, and their variations and nuances, and is capable of operating, reasoning and negotiating within and across them. While one should, in order to be efficacious, understand and use the logic of one’s own frame of reference clearly and accurately, in fact this is rarely the mode in which we operate - far more often do we sit in virtual worlds of language games and social simulacra, and the ability to critically recognise, engage with, and also keep at arms length without losing agency over them is equally important as a person in the world.\n\nWhat’s more, the logic we apply to ourselves often comes *later*, informed by what we experience, and when we turn it back inwards we often find new forms of reason, observation and being than we originally understood.\n\nSo logic clearly can exist as a discipline founded in something important, and I believe the dismissal of the psychologist’s view is carried out too quickly here.",

At least in the parts of this debate I'm familiar with, it's usually presented as something of a skeptical prop that is taken to *motivate* indirect realism, i.e. the idea that if we could have the subjectively same experiences in a skeptical scenario, then experience must constitute a veil across which veridical and non-veridical experiences play out. If you tweak the phrasing a bit from this, you could probably just view the idea that there is a veil *as* the thesis of indirect realism, so it couldn't constitute a challenge as such.\n\nDirect realists like McDowell want to show that the threat of skepticism doesn't force us to assume a veil of perception, so the idea is that the fact that our perception can sometimes be a source of error shouldn't be taken to force the conclusion that it isn't usually a form of direct openness to reality. There are other issues downstream of the veil that are meant to show its absurdity, but I don't know that the impossibility of justification is the main one (as you point out, it wouldn't be a very good one, if it were the way that you formulate it, but this should probably be an indication that you're arguing against something of a straw man). The main issue with the veil is that it challenges the notion that our *conceptual* faculties are really world directed -- the issue which then comes up with respect to justification is whether our judgments, which are formed by those concepts, can be justified *by actual facts in the world.* Otherwise you wind up in the typical internalist-externalist impasse, which is not about whether we can have justifications per se, but whether our justifications can be both accessible and bear conclusively on the world. If you don't have both, then skeptical issues really get going.",

For example:\n\n*\"If eternity is alone real, then the illusory appearing of time must be nothing.\"*\n\nThis absolutely does not follow. Saying that a particular way of understanding something is an \"illusion\" is not equivalent to saying that it's \"nothing\" -- we wouldn't say of a stage magician, for example, that because his performance involves illusion, that there literally is no performance or that his stage is empty.\n\n*\"The idea that time is a misapprehension of reality thus fails. If I am truly misperceiving reality as temporal when in fact everything is static, I cannot explain the appearance of the supposed illusion of time. As others like Arthur Prior have noted, the supposed misperceiving or confusion itself appears temporally, and it would be impossible for this appearing to happen if reality, including my perception of it, were actually static.\"*\n\nSays who? It seems like it would be rather easy for a physicalist, for example, to point to this and say that there is a difference between time as it is understood by physics and mathematics versus phenomenology and folk theory, and that the latter can be reduced to the former if we accept the body of evidence supporting the idea that our thoughts themselves are the product of neurochemical reactions in the brain. If the physical laws governing those reactions (and therefore our thoughts) don't actually conform to time as we perceive it, and can be still be explained (and perhaps even explained better) without it, then there's no ground for simply asserting without further argument that we \"cannot explain the appearance\" of our experience of time. It would be like saying that the Earth must be flat because the horizon nevertheless appears so to every scientist who has considered the evidence for the Earth being round.",

        "body": "This is an interesting argument, but it is not a fully Hegelian one. The clue is in this passage:\n\n\n> \"In my reading, the infamous and highly debated Hegelian dictum that reason is reality means then that we cannot think a reality beyond our rational categories. Any attempt to do so simply puts this “beyond” back into the grasp of reason (the idea of the beyond is itself our own), preventing it from being the absolute beyond it ought to be. In other words, we cannot think beyond our own thinking\"\n\n\nThis is a Kantian interpretation of Hegel's \"rational is actual\" that sustains the whole text. It privileges experience, and, naturally, the A-theory of time (what is called 'time') over the B-theory of time (what is called 'eternal').\n\n\nIn reality, Hegel's time is not nearly so straight-forward. The focus on the eternal's relation to the temporal betrays this: if we substitute 'eternal' with 'infinite' and 'temporal' with 'finite', we get Beiser's interpretation of the Hegelian conflict between whole and part:\n\n\n1. If we take the finite to be separate from the infinite, then now the infinite is limited by the finite, insofar it is something uncontained by it. It makes the infinite incomplete.\n2. If we take the finite to be internal to the infinite, then we get a natural contradiction in the unity of opposite notions - there is a part of the infinite which is not eternal. It makes the infinite inconsistent.\n\n\nThe answer (Beiser's) Hegel gives is not to privilege one over the other (as the argument privileges A-theory) but of course to take these two conceptions of the infinite at different moments in time. \n\n\nWitnessing an event in the present, the infinite must be consistent (if incomplete) to account for the freedom of a subject, a freedom which is infinite. Then, witnessing an event after it has passed, the infinite must be complete (if inconsistent) so that what once appeared as freedom is now necessity, reason realizing itself in history.\n\n\nThat is, Hegel accounts for two true notions of the infinite by locating them as true at different points in time. Now, switching 'infinite' back to 'eternal' and 'finite' back to 'temporal', we must see that both A-theory and B-theory are true at different points in time: when looking at the present, and when looking at the past, respectively.\n\n\nTime is, itself, a concept that depends on the time of the subject that conceives it. If you want to have a Hegelian argument instead of a Kantian one, in my opinion, this is the minimal path.",

By definition of how he would use the word, that is like saying it is a good way of imagining the relations, not they are the relations in actuality. I think too many people start with a misunderstanding of Einstein and then go off into this head space of claiming he thought it absolute. That is his model yes, but to say he didn't think further models might come about is stupid. He was revising Newton after all.\n\nStill, time is movement from one frame of reference to another & that is relative due to time/space being a thing, not 2 things. The thing you are calling time, he would call the delta between positions in space, which can be experienced differently to an individual experiencing the delta/t. Still, this is notation of an experience, not the experience. The article was after your experience of time/space, since it invokes Einstein's ghost to back the claim.\n\nWhere does this leave us? The model isn't to say time is a block, like space, but rather is conceptualized by a being that can't experience that dimension as such. We don't move in time like riding a bike down the street & then going back reverts the positions. We are caught in a singular direction in time. So, that claim of time being a block, is to say a model is reality, which the argument in the article does cover the concept of.\n\nI think it isn't talking about what it is trying to talk about, but rather is talking about the experience. Yes, I am experiencing it, whatever it is that I am swimming in, because I have little control of direction, yet a current caused by space has me in its clutches. The model is a representation of this, but to say it is this is an illusion.\n\nTo quote Monte Python, \"It's only a model.\". You are fine to ignore relativity in this debate. You are talking about the change over time, which physics is going to say is happening & that's all you need from science. Time is this, but that is hardly philosophy.\n\nI think distinctions in how we experience time is far more interesting than saying that time is an illusion. Misapprehension isn't illusion, it's how we experience a real thing. Red exists only in my mind, but the wave is real. Red is only a model in my mind of that real wave.",

I've met a lot of people I've considered \"self-important\" in my day, and the one thing they *all* had in common was that they didn't see themselves that way. That's kind of the thing about \"self-importance.\" It's like being \"heinously vicious.\" People don't normally see themselves that way. The Effective Altruist doesn't see themselves as \"dangerous,\" whether they subscribe to  longtermism, transhumanism or whatever other \"I don't like it-ism\" that Professor Gilbert can come up with. They're doing what they think is right, and the Professor doesn't attempt to speak to such people on their terms. In other words, his moral agency personalism isn't better at getting a transhumanist to *their own* idea of the right and good; it's simply a different bucket for people to sort themselves into. And it's when people start to see those in other buckets as bad, or even merely misguided, that things start to go off the rails.\n\nIf Professor Gilbert's \"we\" is going to include all of humanity (or at least all those humans capable of the Professor's understanding of moral agency), it's going to have to speak to everyone on their own terms, rather than down to them as some sort of dupe who doesn't realize that they're being played by \"the purposes of infomaniacal hypercapitalism.\"",

        "body": "Need feedback on this thesis of a Philosophy I’m working on with a confidante. Any and all feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\n**Paradoxism**\n\n\n\n**Paradoxism: A Final Acceptance of Life’s Bleak Truth**\n\n\n\nIn the face of all that is, there is only one unrelenting truth: suffering will come, and death will claim us all. **Paradoxism** does not seek to shield you from this certainty; it offers no comfort in the face of this ultimate truth. It is a philosophy born from the bleak acceptance that life is a cycle of pain, emptiness, and eventual death—where meaning is sought not in the illusions of salvation or happiness, but in the raw, unfiltered confrontation with our inevitable end.\n\n\n\nThis is not the optimism of a dreamer who believes in a shining tomorrow. **Paradoxism** is the refusal to turn away from the darkness. It asks not for hope, but for the courage to stand in the face of despair and death, and to embrace the futility of it all—not as something to be mourned, but as the only truth that is. You will suffer. You will die. And in the coldest, most merciless of ways, this will be the end. This is the reality, and it is one we must face head-on, without delusion or fear.\n\n\n\nYet, within this acceptance lies the paradox. For it is precisely because death waits for us all that we must choose to live—not in search of escape, but in spite of it. We cannot flee from suffering. We cannot flee from death. But we can stand, one final defiant step before the abyss, and in that defiance, find a semblance of meaning. It is through the embrace of suffering, in its full and terrible weight, that we transcend it.\n\n\n\nBut above all else, there exists a defiance more powerful than all: **kindness**. A simple, yet revolutionary act in the face of a world that scorns it. When the world seeks to strip away your humanity, to break you down into nothing, the greatest rebellion you can perform is to extend a hand, to offer compassion. **Kindness** is the ultimate act of resistance against a universe that insists we are nothing more than fleeting shadows—because it asserts that, despite it all, you still choose to care. You still choose to love. You still choose to be human. In a world that calls for cruelty, your kindness becomes your most powerful weapon.\n\n\n\n**Paradoxism** is not a philosophy for the faint-hearted, nor is it for those seeking comfort in this world. It is a philosophy for those who are willing to face the abyss—not to escape it, but to rise above it. A philosophy that calls you to be both the creator and the destroyer, to shatter the chains that bind you, and rebuild yourself in the very fires of your suffering.\n\n\n\nThis philosophy is formless, shapeless. It can be different for everyone, just as it has been for us. It is a path not defined by others, but by your own soul, forged in the crucible of your existence. It is not about finding meaning in the world, but creating your own meaning, in defiance of the world’s emptiness.\n\n\n\nYou will be shaped by darkness, by pain, by all that is harsh and unyielding. But in embracing it fully, you will find your true self—not the self that society expects, but the self that arises from your refusal to submit, your refusal to become just another fleeting shadow in the world.\n\n\n\nIt is about embracing the abyss, learning from it, being shaped by it, but not entirely of its choice. Use the abyss, but do not fall prey to it. Do not avoid it either, for it is within us all. Only the dark, the cruel, the harrowing aspects of creation may lead you to true transformation. To true realization. To true freedom.\n\n\n\nThis philosophy hinges on the fact that you refuse any and all existing forms of thought, merely taking inspiration from their good aspects, and creating something new, something unique, something truly yours. This is the ultimate defiance, the rejection of any false meaning. For **Paradoxism** is your creation, your story, and no one else’s. It is your rebellion, your path, your paradox.\n\n\n\n*—Neel & Eron*",

Namely if they don't exist casually and they aren't a product of our mind, how do we have epistemic access to them? Making abstract objects 'thoughts' while maintaining their mind independence (somewhat a contradiction in terms in my view) doesn't help with that problem.\n\nBased on what do we claim for example that 1+1=2 as opposed to 1+1=1? Because you cannot imagine it being so? For one that seems like a fearly weak argument (Euclid couldn't imagine that two parallel lines could even intersect, but that turned out to be possible).\n\nAnd is it not in principle conceivable to imagine alternative formal systems of mathematics and logic which have completley different true statements? The answer is yes, not only theoretically, but practically. For example compare euclidean and non euclidean geometry. One states that the internal angles of a triangle add up to 180 degrees, while the other doesn't. Which abstract/thought is correct/objective?\n\nDoes it not seem more plausible to say that abstract systems are created by us and thus whatever truths are a result of them are simply the result of whatever axioms we pick as starting points? Abstraction isn't a method of tapping into some other realm of truth, beyond the world in front of our senses. It is instead as simple as imagining a statement to be true; \"Paralel lines never intersect.\" and working out what consequences of those postulates through reason, which is itself made up of other postulates. What abstract systems we end up choosing isn't arbitrary of course, we chose the ones that best help us model reality (perhaps even unconsciously as part of our biological heritage), but that doesn't mean the abstraction is in the world, rather they are made to fit it, not the other way around.",

        "body": "The  argument captures something important - the undeniable existence of thoughts - but it doesn’t account for the structure that makes those thoughts possible. Thoughts don’t exist in isolation; they emerge from an iterative process where activity leads to experience, experience leads to abstraction, and abstraction feeds back into activity. After enough cycles, the distinction between thought as an invention and thought as a discovery starts to dissolve. What remains are stable structures like numbers - not because they were simply \"plucked\" from an external reality, but because they are the inevitable attractors in the space of abstraction.\n\nThe author argues that thoughts exist because they are undeniable, but that treats them as static entities rather than as positions in a dynamic system. Thoughts don’t just \"exist\" - they emerge, evolve, and stabilize within an abstraction space that is shaped by cognition but isn’t reducible to it. The mind isn’t just generating thoughts; it’s iterating through patterns of experience until certain abstractions become fixed reference points. This is why numbers feel independent of thought. They are what remains after cognition loops through itself enough times to extract structure from interaction.\n\nThe claim that numbers exist before they are thought seems to push the author into Platonism, even if he tries to avoid it. But if we take the iterative process seriously, we don’t need to commit to either a purely mind-independent realm of abstract objects or a purely mind-dependent constructivist view. Numbers - and abstract structures more generally - aren’t merely \"discovered\" nor \"invented.\" They are the emergent residue of cognition interacting with reality. Minds don’t just pick numbers out of nowhere; they converge on them. The fact that numbers pre-exist individual thoughts about them doesn’t mean they exist in a separate metaphysical plane - it means they are the inevitable results of abstraction-space settling into stable patterns.\n\nSo the real question isn't whether thoughts exist - it’s how abstraction-space itself exists. Is it an independent structure that minds navigate, or does it emerge from the activity of cognition itself? Either way, treating thoughts as isolated entities misses the real issue. Thoughts aren’t primary. Abstraction is. And until we fully grasp that, we’re just describing coordinates without defining the map.",

Physical reality. Strictly speaking we have no idea what it is and how it \"looks\" like. The best we have is #2\n\n2. Our model of physical reality. When we say \"the chair is red\" it's just one of the infinite number of ways to describe it. \"the chair\" is the subjective model of objective physical reality. These kinds of truths are only true in our universe (in other universes different models are true).\n\n3. Math. There are two options. It's either the most abstract \"truth\" which is true in every universe. Or it is the property of our mind - how it evolved to model our reality/universe. Most likely we will never know which one it is. \n\n4. Consciousness. Now that's something completely different from all previous points. I only know for sure that my consciousness/experience exists. I can only assume that there are others. Strictly speaking this is the only \"thing\" I know exists for sure.\n\nMixing and matching these categories can lead to all sorts of issues, problems and paradoxes. Which we can easily observe if we look at the history of philosophy - let's say it's just wild.",

        "body": "Something that I don't see mentioned very often is that the objective mathematical entities are contingent on arbitrary axioms. Humans are free to propose elements of a formal space of possibilities, such as the number line, or a set of four symbols that exist in a repeating cycle, but the consequences of these choices are not free for humans to choose. These spaces can be very rich, and so large that we can forget that the starting point was a human choice.\n\nIt is true that mathematical structures that arise from this are extremely useful for modeling parts of the universe, at least to a certain degree of precision. For example there are no chairs in my house that exactly match the archetypal design. No two chairs, even from the same set, weigh the same amount, or have quite the same shape at a microscopic level. However, there are a lot of everyday problems I can solve if I ignore this mismatch between the integers and some hypothetical, completely accurate description of the amount of chair I have in my house.\n\nIntegers are so incredibly descriptive of many phenomena in the universe that it looks like they are not arbitrary. But for the most fundamental phenomenon, where we try not to squint and use a good enough description but are seeking for a truly accurate one, they are not enough. This is all we have to remind us that the application of integers to the world around us is also arbitrary. Like Newtonian mechanics, which we know to be incorrect, it is nevertheless excellent solution to a trade-off between accuracy and simplicity.\n\nI think it's amazing and significant that the mathematical consequences of the axioms we choose are objective, in the sense that no two mathematicians could correctly work out different answers. \n\nHowever, it feels like a proper definition for exist is missing here. For example since we know that the number 30, or the largest prime number under 100, does not manifest in the universe and quite the same way as an apple in my hand, our choice to use the same word puzzles me. If all we mean by exists in the case of mathematical phenomena is that they are objective, that seems so non-controversial that the debate should surely be over. Therefore, it seems to me that the debate is prolonged by being unclear about the definition of exists in this context.",

        "body": "This essay makes a similar mistake as the Dobbs decision it criticizes. Both make the assumption that the founding fathers and their ideological inspirations (1) were basically right about everything and (2) would have been on their side. I think this is a prevalent issue in American politics with respect to many issues, not just abortion. On one side you always have a conservative argument that the founders had a certain intention and we should stick to that intention, while on the other side you have a liberal argument that the founders simply didn’t grasp the future implications of their otherwise perfect ideals. Neither side ever wants to acknowledge the possibility that the founders were either hypocrites or just plain wrong about certain things. \n\nThis essay mentions slavery, for example, arguing that it took time to appreciate that the doctrine of individual rights might imply that slavery should be abolished. This is ahistorical. The founders knew right away that the idea of individual rights had dramatic implications for slavery. A few were therefore opposed to slavery, while others acknowledged that slavery was probably wrong but participated in it anyway, and still others were just outright pro-slavery.\n\nSo on one side, you have Chief Justice Tawny’s opinion in Dred Scott arguing that black people having citizenship rights is not part of the nation’s history, not in the constitution, and not what the founders intended, so black people should never be citizens because the founders were Great Men. And on the other side, you have this notion that the founders just didn’t realize that black people were human beings but *totally* would’ve supported abolition if only they knew, because the founders were Great Men living in a Different Time. Both are wrong. The truth is our founding fathers knowingly allowed their fellow man to be enslaved while claiming to love liberty, and we ought to acknowledge how fucked up that was.\n\nThe Dobbs decisions is the new Dred Scott decision. Legally it is completely sound, just as the Dred Scott decision was. Abortion rights are not part of the nation’s history and not something the founders intended. There is no right to abortion in the constitution just as there were no rights for black people in the constitution at the time of Dred Scott. But we changed that. It took a war and several constitutional amendments, but we changed the constitution to create the society we wanted to have, founders be damned.\n\nSo ultimately I think this essay makes some great points, especially about precisely when a person becomes a “person” with rights, but this essay and the pro-choice movement in general are weighed down by a fruitless effort to make the Constitution a pro-choice document. Locke is not God, the founders are not Jesus and the constitution is not the gospels. We should create the society we think is best regardless of what they would have wanted.",

I tried posting a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/IuHVjghcTnc) introducing a recently-published academic textbook on utilitarianism (that is also available open-access at [utilitarianism.net](http://utilitarianism.net) ), which a mod then deleted as purportedly violating PR2: \"all posts must develop and defend a substantive philosophical thesis\".\n\nThis text is [widely regarded](https://www.utilitarianism.net/about/#endorsements) among academic philosophers as *the* most comprehensive and well-developed defense and exploration of utilitarianism ever published. Perhaps the mod's thought was that the video overview was not *by itself* sufficiently substantive (even though it very succinctly explained the four key principles underlying utilitarianism - which is, of course, an extremely substantive philosophical thesis! - defended how the view accommodates individual rights, and motivated the search for a general moral theory even if the results are sometimes revisionary of ordinary intuitions).\n\nBut that's like deleting a linkpost because the URL by itself is not sufficiently substantive. The URL is a doorway to the substantive philosophical content of interest, and likewise for this introductory video. If it's possible to edit the original post to include a link to [utilitarianism.net](http://utilitarianism.net) alongside the introductory videoclip, I think that would *clearly* better serve the r/philosophy community than outright deleting this resource (which was already starting to prompt some fruitful and clarificatory debate in the comments, before it was peremptorily deleted). The link was, of course, included in the \"abstract\" accompanying the video-post.",

        "body": "Hello everyone,\n\nI would like to open a discussion around Benj Hellie’s vertiginous question and some related work. I have some thoughts about the subject, and I would be very curious to read what you guys may have to add to the discussion.\n\nJust a reminder for starters, the Vertiginous question, as coined by Benj Hellie, interrogates the concept of personal identity and more precisely the reason why one’s own experience of self is attached to one body/person rather than any other one. In other words, why am I me and not anyone else?\n\nThe question can be approached from various angles, but I tend to reject answers like « you are you because you are you » which misses the point of asking the question in the first place. Also, this answer fails to provide sufficient explanation for questions like: Would I still be me if one nucleoids of my DNA had been different the day I was conceived? Or if I had been conceived one day later?\n\nTim Robert’s, while publishing in a controversial journal and making a lot of approximations, had some interesting thoughts about the subject in his paper: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618472\\_The\\_Even\\_Harder\\_Problem\\_of\\_Consciousness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228618472_The_Even_Harder_Problem_of_Consciousness)\n\nFor those who will read it (it's a small paper), I wonder what you guys think of his no argument (e.g., No, even a small difference would result in the newborn not being \"me\"). I find his argument to exclude the \"no\" unconvincing because he relies on low probability. But even extremely low probability doesn’t suffice to exclude an argument, specifically when confronting existential questions like this one.\n\nI would rather present another argument that I think, even being based on a thought experiment, can reject the idea that personal consciousness depends only on materiality.\n\nHere it is: What would happen if, at the moment of my conception, the freshly fertilized egg was entirely copied by a machine that reproduced perfectly the complexity of DNA (100% of the nucleoids matching). Will the two theorically perfect identical twins to be born share the same consciousness, or would they both have their own personal perspective? My answer would be similar to the answer for the question: would a perfect clone of you produced right now share your immediate personal consciousness? No, the only difference between us would be specifically our unique experience of the self.\n\nI know that thought experiments aren’t producing the best arguments, but this one doesn’t seem completely out of reach in the distant future.\n\nWhat do you think? Do you have any contradictions to bring? Theories about the origin of the personal experience that would rely on other levels of materiality (quantum, unknown...) or even not material? For example: Are atoms unique? Would my atoms be unique to me and be impossible to « copy » ? Making them the core root of a self? It seems unlikely, but that could be an answer.\n\nEvery contribution is welcomed. Thank you.",

        "body": "Had to write a first person narrative about overcoming fears but I wrote about Aristotle instead! Here’s the short essay I wrote:\n\nSpace is more complex than just an empty void. Space is the same as water in a cup. The water is placed inside its boundaries of the cup, and the cup represents its designated place. \n\nThe universe must have some kind of boundary that limits space. The idea of infinite space can’t possibly be true. How can such a vast place have no structure, limitations, or containment? I’ve tried to understand this view of the universe being infinite, but alas, it can’t possibly be true. This space is not ‘space’, it is a place. A place with boundaries and limits that control how the stars and planets move.\n\nThis challenge of understanding this vast universe brings me to higher levels of understanding.\n\nI must start with a model that will prove my theory. I call this a ‘Geocentric model.’ The first sphere is the Earth. Earth is the most stagnant and unmoving object I know, so everything must orbit around it. In my past philosophies, I have established that every element has its natural positioning. This theory leads me to Earth being at the center of the universe, and everything else revolves around it. Earth is stationary and at the center of the universe.\n\nIn this next sphere must lie the celestial bodies, or planets. The solar system is just concentric spheres that carry celestial bodies.\n\nFinally, the boundary that limits the universe. The Sphere of the Prime Mover. This sphere is in a fixed place and marks the boundary of the universe. After the Prime Mover, there is nothing—no time, matter, or space.\n\nIn this pursuit of understanding, I will admit that there are many hurdles to overcome. There are moments where the movements of the planets do not align with my theory. Planets seem to reverse their course of orbit, how can I explain this with my current model of the universe? These irregularities disprove my theory on perfect and ordered heavens. \n\nThough my theory is yet to be complete, I am confident that it is correct and will form a foundation for future editions. Creating such a theory will come with many struggles, for the universe is confusing. \n\nNOTE: Sorry it isn’t very factual, it’s hard to write in present tense/first-person and be completely factual.",

For example, many people would consider the confederates as traitors (excluding the slavery stuff) but no one now adays considers the Americans traitors to the british. The only fundamental difference in the revolutions (again policy being irrelevant) is that the Americans won and the South lost. \n\nBut that can’t be it.

Thus it is possible to create a model of thinking that can acknowledge all possible human actions and reactions in a general sense (based on a mix of psychology knowledge and reasoned anecdotal evidence (face value fitting together of experiences into a something sensical)). \n\nHow people think is infinitely individual, but how they behave is limited by every single physical and environmental factor that exists.\n\nTo 'escape your own perspective' would be to imagine the perspective of another person based on your knowledge of them and the world and you'll be about as accurate as anyone can be with pi, yet nobody says 2 billion digits of pi is completely wrong despite it not being correct. \n\nIf you can imagine another persons life experience give what they tell you, lies and all, you can guess and assuming you know enough about how people \"operate\" and can fit them into a place in your model for society then you can GUESS and be correct. There's true perspective and applied perspective, its like the difference between knowing how many atoms an individual is made up of VS knowing how many years they've been alive, sort of kind of.\n\nAlso, I'd posit that subjective is an unhelpful concept in understanding people as it places their opinion at odds with reality, thus denying the reality of their perspective in your assessment of reality generally. Once you can account for the subjective and the objective, you'll come to understand the contradictory nature of reality which is a topic for another time entirely.\n\nAnyway, I hope I was able to stay on topic and within the guidelines of the sub, I just kinda barfed my 'opinion' out after reading a couple other responses.

Moral psychology fails to account for the forgiveness of epistemic wrongs and for the way that wrongs in general have epistemic implications. Social epistemology, for its part, neglects the way that epistemic trust is not only conferred but repaired. In this essay, I show that the repair of epistemic trust through forgiveness is necessary to the economy of knowledge for fallible persons like us. Despite the fact that forgiveness is never included on lists of important intellectual virtues or epistemic activities, it is vital to our lives as social knowers. Likewise, an account of forgiveness that neglects its epistemic dimension is importantly incomplete.",

You can define very large numbers easily, and phrase them in terms of your utility instead of money, and increase rewards faster than probability drops. Also, the probability should be bounded _below_, for reasons like \"you may have brain damage right now\" for example. So it remains a very compelling argument against fanaticism.\n\nExpected utility maximization and probability, when used for decisionmaking, are mathematical abstractions; map, not territory. (Also, subjective, so you can always allege you have a not-falling-for-dumb-tricks component in your utility, but that's smug trickery, not philosophy.) Among the things it presupposes is, for example, a clean dualism-like separation of mind / the rest of the world. If you start with some more basic abstraction, like preferences over world states, you'll note that in most of these 0.00000000whatever probability scenarios, you are trying to distinguish indistinguishable worlds, or imagine unimaginable (vague, underspecified, abstract) worlds, and that's what causes the problems. \"A future state of the world I would prefer a 5% chance of instead of getting an ice cream\" sounds plausible even if you defer thinking of what that world looks like in any detail - but then, having accepted that, you think you can just change the numbers no problem and have everything work close-to-linearly, which isn't necessarily true. For all you know, the processes in your mind would imagine the exact same world if the number you read was 4%, and this is not just due to human error / a lack of consistency.\n\nA lot of human decisionmaking isn't continuous, and even the mental representations of what you're doing aren't continuous. There is some \"granularity\" to worlds as represented in our minds, and language lets us describe hypotheticals that forcibly break it much too easily, whereas real life behavior is different. For example, going from \"haven't eaten lunch\" to \"have eaten lunch\" can involve eating anywhere between 21001 and 21014 rice kernels, and in a very reasonable sense that information is _unimportant_ to practical or ethical decisionmaking - the only ways to make it important are deeply contrived thought experiments. So, it may be possible to calculate e.g. a dollar or time or energy price per rice kernel, but you _shouldn't_ use that price for reasoning about decisions involving single-digit amounts of rice kernels, even though it seems to be perfectly consistent, and certainly more consistent than any hard-to-formalize ignore-small-amounts alternative.\n\nMy intuition is that all \"problematic\" thought experiments will have an element of this thing. Just remember that hypothetical worlds live in your brain only, and if you stop thinking about them they go away.",

Mathematically, the expected value of a random function is what the average result converges to over an infinite number of trials. If I buy a $10 lottery ticket with a one-in-a-million chance of winning a billion dollars, the \"expected value\" of that ticket is $1000. I \"expect\" a $990 profit! Except I don't—I expect to lose my money, because a one-in-a-million chance won't actually happen in practice. It will happen eventually, if you buy *enough* lottery tickets, but in this example only one ticket is for sale, which means you're wasting money in practice no matter what the math says. We don't get to live our lives an infinite number of times and take the average value of each decision. We get a few short years. If you give up a life of modest contentment for a 1% chance at lifelong ecstasy, the fact that your decision had an \"expected value of warm satisfaction\" won't make you any happier when you're miserable on your deathbed. Life isn't probabilistic; probability *models* life, but it is an imperfect model, and you can't follow it to absurd conclusions.\n\nA few rebuttals to the counterarguments presented by the article:\n\n> **Discounting Small Probabilities**: The main problem with the view is that it will require some principled way of individuating possible outcomes.

This means that if you ignore probabilities of 1/n or lower, you should think that you have a 0% chance of winning any amount of money.\n\nThis is the author's rebuttal to my view, so I need to respond: Cancelling out small probabilities is like rounding. If you round at every step of an equation, you lose precision. Leave all rounding to the end. Calculate the probability of a good outcome overall, and if that probability is small, *then* discard it. Just use common sense: If separating an event into an infinite number of infinitesimally likely outcomes leads us to conclude that nothing can ever happen, then *don't separate the event into that many outcomes.* You're letting the quirks of your mathematical models distract you from the practicalities of the issue they're meant to describe. \n\n> **A General Argument**: Imagine now that you have two roulette wheels[.] [...] [W]hen deciding between the risky option and the safe option for any particular case, it doesn’t make any difference whether that choice is part of a sequence, or a single choice; no one who’s affected by that choice is affected by previous or future choices, and these are by definition the only people being affected by that choice. Thus it shouldn’t make any difference to your choice whether you’re betting once or doing it several times.\n\nWe can analyze this like the example above. If we get to spin the wheel many times, the overall final outcome of the risky strategy is likely to be good. If we only get to spin it once, the final outcome is very unlikely to be good, so we can discard it. We can slice it into individual spins and play with the math, but that doesn't change the overall situation: If you only spin the wheel once, and you choose the risky bet, you just won't save anyone in practice. You're throwing away your shot. The odds are too low to matter, and when you can only spin once, you can't amortize that away.\n\n> **St. Petersburg Paradox:** I think this is a very strong argument, and I’m honestly not sure what is the best solution for fanaticism. Still, I don’t think any theory gets out of it unscathed, and so I don’t think it’s too worrying.\n\nI agree that this is a strong argument against fanaticism, but unfortunately for the author of the article, my theory gets out completely unscathed. The author's attack against the \"discounting small probabilities\" position depends on the \"individuating options in a non-arbitrary way\" thing, which I escaped earlier by being willing to individuate options arbitrarily, based on common sense. Ethics is a practical field, after all: I don't think we need a mathematically principled reason to distinguish between \"there's a negligible likelihood that this plan will work, therefore we can assume it'll fail for sure\" and \"well a dart can hit a dartboard in infinite infinitesimal, negligibly-likely spots, therefore we can assume it won't hit the dartboard at all.\"",

At the same time, we are neither entirely solitary like some species nor a hive mind like some insects. Instead we evolved as autonomous individuals who have an instinct to cooperate with others in matters beyond a single individual’s capability to spread the burden of survival, but then retain our autonomy where individual decision-making is conducive to survival. \n\nNone of this would be possible without a strong biologically-wired instinct to retain autonomy even within a group dynamic. \n\nThis could be the main reason that freedom is important to us.

        "body": "Philosophical Foundations of Logic (Please critique)\n\nHi all,  \nI've been trying to build out my philosophical and epistemological foundations without taking any presuppositions. I have tried looking up theories and haven't found anything that quite matches, so I'm pitching this as a new thing. I've been going with the working name of \"Experiential Pragmatism\". Here I'll build up through logic and a bit. If you see any flaws or have any critiques/things I should look up, let me know! But enough preamble, here's my foundations:\n\n.\n\nThe first fact about reality we gain from the Cogito, \"I think, therefore I am\". This is a self-evident fact of reality, that I exist. What this isn't a claim about is that \"I\" is an independent identity from the rest of the universe, or that \"thinking\" is a process that happens over time. It is merely an acknowledgement of the existence of my experience, and the labelling of that consciousness as \"me\"/\"I\".\n\nFrom this fact, we know there is a fact. It is true to say I exist. The universe has some characteristic, some reality, some fact of it's being, some \"is\". My experience is as my experience is. This shows, at least within the structure of my experience, a fundamental consistency to reality. Wherever this consistency exists, where something has a particular nature to it's reality, where there is an \"is\", we have the law of identity (consistency is definitionally equivalent to this law). Thus we've shown the law of identity applies, at least within the bounds of my experience.\n\nNext, we can create a descriptive framework by introducing the concept of \"not\". We can define \"not\" as the complement to/universal exclusion of an \"is\". This does not change anything about reality, but merely gives a method to describe it and contrast things. With this definition, if you were to ever show something to be \"true\" and \"not true\" (aka \"false\"), it would necessarily mean you had misused the term \"not\". Thus by the definition of \"not\", our descriptive framework enforces the law of non-contradiction, and applies wherever there is consistency/an \"is\".\n\nAdditionally, by defining \"not\" as a universal exclusion, it is defined to include everything else. This definitionally leaves no overlap and no empty spaces. For any \"is\", there is the \"not\", and definitionally there is nothing else. This means statements can be true or false, and nothing else (even if unknown). As long as there is consistency, an \"is\", our definition of \"not\" enforces this within our descriptive framework. Thus, we've shown the law of excluded middle to apply, at least within the bounds of my experience.\n\nThis gives us the 3 foundational laws of logic. They are less restrictions on reality, but a descriptive framework for describing reality. The majority is derived definitionally, with the only requirement for this framework to be valid being consistency. Wherever there is consistency, the laws of logic can be used to describe the consequences of said consistency. And from the cogito, we know my experience exhibits such a consistency. So, at a fundamental level of my experience, logic applies.\n\n.\n\nI believe this to be presupposition free and able to support a coherent, productive worldview. Overall, I think this is a powerful and extremely defensible position to ground my epistemology in. I'd love to hear y'all's thoughts and critiques on this framework! If you can think of any way to improve it, please share!\n\n.\n\nSome important notes/caveats on this foundation:\n\nThis does not assume any facts about reality beyond my experience. The fact I exist is the only real ontological claim I can justify within this framework. As far as I'm aware, this framework offers no way to ever know the true ontological nature of reality.\n\nOn describing our experiences, our logical descriptive framework requires consistency, and without presuppositions we cannot ensure consistency of events within our experience. What we can do is inductively determine consistency is likely within our experiences, and then draw logical conclusions based on these likely consistencies. This means we can never be 100% sure of anything within our experiences, but can pragmatically inform our decisions based on our goals/desires within our experiences. This allows for the formation of science and epistemology, but only on a pragmatic level and not on an ontological level or a 100% confidence level.\n\nOn accepting the cogito and claiming no presuppositions, my understanding is a self-evident fact is different from a presupposition. Based on this I don't believe the cogito is a presupposition. If that is not a mistaken understanding, then this framework is indeed presupposition free.\n\n\"Knowledge\" in this framework would have to not be defined as 100% surety, but it would still be a completely meaningful term on a pragmatic level.\n\nMathematics is a continuation of creating definitions for descriptive frameworks. So, similarly to logic, it is reliant on consistency and can be used to describe things, but doesn't have any controlling power on the reality, only our ability to understand it.\n\nIn the case logic fails (see Gödel's second incompleteness Theorem), there was never a consistent \"true\" statement. In this case \"not\" is an empty set (the \"Is\" includes everything, therefore the universal exclusion includes nothing). In this scenario, logic wouldn't have been proven wrong, just proven to be pragmatically useless.",

Here's a thing I've attempted to post to the community and would like discussion on:\n\n**THESIS: For A Thing To Be Impressive, It Must Be Aspirational**\n\nTake a walk with me here, friends :)\n\nRecently, I came across an Instagram Reel where a rather large woman were attempting to get into a bathtub. A user responded with the comment, \"Impressive,\" responding moreso to her size, as she never does overcome the feat of entering the tub by the video's end. Looking at the woman's size compared to the tub, indeed, it were a thing out of the ordinary.\n\nYet, I could not help but think that the user did not truly mean to call the woman's size——one, again, not ordinary for humans——impressive. Why so? Well, I assume that that user would never want to be such a size, let alone many of us.\n\nAnd so, I've gone down a rabbit-hole of sorts into that sentiment. I do not believe a thing a person would not personally want can be impressive. Shocking? Sure. Unordinary? Sure. But not impressive.\n\nOf course, we have to consider that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as any size, action, thought, feat, etc. can be aspirational depending on who you ask. Many people would not agree that 20th-century genocides are a thing they'd wish to repeat. When looking at the sheer number of deaths brought on by such mass-murderers, one can say that it is noteworthy——as modern society never before witnessed state-sponsored death on such a scale . Yet impressive? I do not believe that is the word most mean to use in their description of these acts.\n\nTo be impressed is to admire a thing. To admire a thing is to respect and approve of it. What d'ya think?",

No).\n\nSo they're debating the applicability of some other meaning of *exist*. That meaning is thematically related to those other definitions, but is distinct.\n\nOkay, so now let me introduce the idea of vacuous concepts. Let's say I made a claim that my jeans have property X, a property that no other object in the universe has. This is (for now) a vacuous concept. X isn't empirically measurable, it holds no explanatory power, no relevance to other concepts, it's just a conceptual set I defined whose membership is one object: my jeans.\n\nIf my friend disagreed with me about property X, claiming that my hat also has property X, our debate is also vacuous. The argument can never be resolved in an objective way, since X has no relationship to anything other than our assertions and the debate itself. X could acquire cultural weight as a phenomenon discussed by many people, and (in the sense I mean the word) the concept is still vacuous.\n\nOne way to resolve the argument is to state that my friend and I are actually talking about *different properties*. Since the only tangible quality of property X (other than the accident of its name) is what it applies to, then X = {my jeans} and X = {my jeans, my hat} are different properties. To put this another way, this is a definitional problem.\n\nThe debate between Eternalism and Presentism looks like an elaborate version of this this to me. It's framed as a debate about whether the past exists, as if 'exist' was a well-defined substantial property, but from what I can tell it's the other way around. When I go looking (as a non-philosopher, to be sure) I find alarming statements like:\n\n>[It is sensible](https://philarchive.org/archive/INGPAE#:~:text=for%20Eternalism%3A%20Fatalism-,Eternalism%20says%20that%20past%2C%20present%2C%20and%20future%20entities%20exist%20simpliciter,are%20ontologically%20on%20a%20par) to proceed on the basis that all such questions are considered in light of a shared assumption about existence, such that all disputants have the same notion in mind and mean the same by “exist” when they answer and assert “xs exist” or “xs do not exist.” Here many assume that existence is univocal and there is one fundamental sense of “exists” captured by the existential quantifier of first-order predicate logic (Sullivan 2012: 150; Ingram 2019: 16), sometimes presented as “existence simpliciter” (Deng 2018: 794).  \n—David Ingram, Presentism and Eternalism\n\nI realize that my position sounds like an insistence that technical concepts be immediately accessible to non-specialists; that's not a fair standard to apply and doesn't hold for other domains I take seriously.\n\nI guess what's gnawing at me, however, is that *exists* in this context may only have relevance among a network of similarly arbitrary concepts.",

        "body": "**Shopping Cart Reprisal**\n\nThis one keeps popping up in my feeds and it drives mad.\n\nYou know the argument. To return a shopping cart to the corral after use is morally correct and proves that one can self govern. Doing otherwise, since the act has no reward or punishment, is amoral.\n\nI’m paraphrasing, but what irks me most is that the shopping cart, corral, and parking lot are all under the stewardship of the grocery store or other like business.\n\nThe act of returning your cart may help another person. By easing the duty of the employed cart collector or by clearing your cart from usable walking/parking spaces, this makes the act right in itself.\n\nHowever the cart collection is the purview of the store. A store that provides shopping carts to its patrons may employ as many cart collectors as necessary. This could be zero of such employees, or every patron could be met at their vehicles with a tuxedoed cart farer waiting to return your cart with a white-gloved hand.\n\nFor the store owner and employer, the idea of providing maximal service would seem ludicrous. So the owners have settled into a happy medium where the shoppers are half responsible for their own cart and a small amount of employees will collect them often.\n\nLet’s pivot to a grocery store bagging. A store may hire a suitable amount of bagging employees so that customers may do no work. Or, as seen more and more commonly is that patrons of stores are expected to bag their own groceries. \n\nWe end up with the same moral conundrum. Bagging your own groceries is moral  and  leaving the act of bagging to the register employee is amoral. By refusing to bag your own groceries, you are holding every other customer up and doubling the duties of the checkout clerk. \n\nSurprise, this isn’t a moral issue but an economic one, and to me, specifically, this is a labor/capital issue\n\nThese stores have no duty or obligation to provide these services. Yet the services are expected and demanded by society. Yes, it is good for the owner and employer of the store to pass these duties onto the customer. The customer, however is now working for the store, minutely and without compensation.\n\nThe store owners are double dipping. They have less employees to pay and gain the labor of the customer.\n\nSo what is the issue? By going to a cart providing store, one agrees to the circumstance of returning your cart. That is the unsigned contract. You might get someone to bag your groceries and you might not. The option the shopper has is to which store to give your money. Which services do you require and how much are you willing to give up for convenience.\n\nFor many people, however, there is little or no choice. This is because of the customer’s budget or because of which stores are near enough to be worth traveling. The contract is nonnegotiable. Also, these general trends to offload more work onto customers seems to be prevailing . The customer has not agreed to these changes, they have accepted them.\n\nFor example, a store may have no cart corrals and now the customer must return it all the way themselves. This is nearly the same argument, but the act would not feel good to the customer. The cart corral is expected by the customer. Changes like this do not test the morality of the customer but instead unveil the true reason for returning the cart.\n\nWho is the benefactor of returning a cart?  The benefactor of such an action is not society and the action is not good in itself. The benefactor of these acts are the owners and share holders of these companies.\n\nFor each instance of the customer giving labor in lieu of a hired employee, there is an exchange of labor, creating more wealth to the owners of the store. \n\nThus, the original argument that returning your cart is a selfless, moral act indicating the ability to self govern is false. It is an exchange of money and labor, only.\n\nSo while one may take their time to return a cart while no one is looking, I say, make them hire another person.",

Thing how many people have died in 2024 because of political wars and wars of power and environmental calamities but it doesn't matter to us its just a number, isn't it; but think of it how many fathers has lost their children how many how many brothers have lost their sisters how many mothers and think of it those small and lovely children with their tender carcas below all that  rubble but its just a number to us we generally don't care, but if a person we know dies we are devastated (i thing u get what i m trying to say)\nsame goes for animals as we kill all other animals except for those we consider pets....\n\nSo i want to explore on this idea and get insights of people on this topic \nand most importantly i want some suggestions of book to read that offer similar ideology and gives my a way to think towards and to get some answers...........\n\nPS thanks alot of reading this far",

        "body": "The Deceptive Nature of Humor: A Universal Mechanism of Cognitive Dissonance\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper proposes a novel framework for understanding humor as a universal mechanism rooted in deception. Humor arises when a conscious being experiences a mismatch between perception and reality, revealing an underlying incongruity. This dissonance—a form of benign deception—elicits joy and laughter when the outcome is interpreted as harmless or absurd. By exploring humor’s reliance on cognitive dissonance, this paper highlights its relevance to consciousness, cognition, and societal interaction. Furthermore, it examines the practical implications of this theory in areas such as mental health, artificial intelligence, and cultural understanding.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHumor is a universal phenomenon that transcends cultures, languages, and species. While its manifestations vary widely, the underlying mechanism that triggers laughter and joy remains consistent: a surprising resolution of incongruity. This paper argues that humor is fundamentally based on deception, where an experience or information leads to an expectation that is intentionally or unintentionally subverted.\n\nUnlike malicious deception, humor operates within a safe framework where the resolution of the incongruity is benign. This distinction is key to understanding how humor functions as both a cognitive process and a social tool.\n\nThe Core Theory: Humor as Deception\n\nCognitive Dissonance and the Role of Expectations\n\nHumor begins with an experience or stimulus that sets up an expectation. When the reality of the situation contradicts this expectation, a cognitive dissonance arises. The mind seeks to reconcile this mismatch, and if the resolution is harmless, the result is often laughter.\n\n\\- Example: The classic joke, “Why did the scarecrow win an award? Because he was outstanding in his field,” sets up an expectation of a legitimate achievement but resolves with a pun. The deception lies in leading the listener to anticipate one interpretation while delivering another.\n\nThe Benign Violation Theory\n\nHumor thrives on the tension between perceived danger or violation and the assurance of safety. For instance, slapstick comedy—like slipping on a banana peel—relies on the perception of potential harm, which is defused by the harmless outcome. This duality reinforces the idea that humor is a form of safe deception.\n\n\\- If the perceived danger becomes real (e.g., a serious injury), the humor vanishes, as the deception transitions from benign to harmful.\n\nThe Ethical Dimension of Deception\n\nThis theory raises questions about the ethics of deception. While humor involves benign misdirection, it shares structural similarities with harmful forms of manipulation. Understanding where humor ends and harmful deception begins is a critical area for further research.",

But I am no stranger to you typical thoughts and questions about the world and society we are forced to live in. Recently I have been reading a book that has peaked my interest. It's called The Essay: A Philosophy Classic by Michael De Montaigne, a French Revolutionary Philosopher. This book, based on Montaigne's personal experiences during his time, is on an area of philosophy I don't see commonly talked about: Moral Philosophy. This may be a subtopic to the understanding of others.\n\nI digress. In my attempt to read the introduction of this book, I can't help but feel that I bit off more than I can chew. A habit I find myself doing quite often in many of my passions. I would like to know where I could start my studies of philosophy. What would be the best place, or best book, to start? I plan to visit my local library very soon and would like to check out a book or two to read. I am also a fan of Penguin Books, I have noticed many great classics are published through this particular publication.\n\nI would love some recommendations, especially since the unavailability of TikTok here in the United States. It's time I fill my time with hobbies beneficial to my mental health. Thank you so much for taking the time to read this and maybe leave a recommendation or two!

An algorithm, or a gearing ratio, is only a non-physical entity in the sense that they are the generalisations over a large array of possible physical representations. That is, it's a way how we linguistically represent the commonality between, say, a piece of C code written by hand on a piece of paper, carved into wood, held in some neurons, stored as electric potentials in DRAM or flash memory, magnetic fields on hard disk platters or tape, the result of compiling that C code to ARM or x86 or RISC-V or whatever machine code, again, stored in electric potentials or magnetic fields, or printed out as a hex dump, ...\n\nThose are all completely physical artefacts that have effects on the physical world through physical means ... it's just that we have invented a linguistic short-hand that references the commonality between all of those  physical things, and we sometimes call that \"non-physical\", but only because the specific physical representation is of little relevance to discussions of that commonality, not because the commonality obviates the need for physical instantiation for an algorithm to actually exist, let alone affect anything.",

If you’re just pushing pieces around, you’re just a hairless monkey playing around, you’re not playing Chess.\n\nEach player considers a set of moves that are valid, countermoves that the opponent can make and is left with essentially a set of actions of differing risk and advantage. The only decision they are making is essentially a guess, having faith their risk calculation paid off.\n\nGood players are good at taking actions that reduce their losses and place themselves in positions of advantage. Their logic is reinforced through playing the game and learning effective play.\n\nJust because we don’t currently understand how the brain stores and forms these possibilities as concepts doesn’t mean we can’t program computers that follow instructions that can very accurately take the advantage on people and explain exactly how they did. \n\nLet’s say I make a program that the computer shows exactly how it chose its actions in a Chess game, and shows which logic it used by logging what logical modules it used, and outputting exactly how it made decisions step-by-step. \n\nHow do we know our brain isn’t doing the same thing? Essentially in our brains we’ve formed subroutines that are refined by learning and recalled to varying degrees of efficiency depending on our body’s state?\n\nWhat if one day our brain could be hooked up to a machine that outputs the subroutines it used to make a decision based on the possible valid sets of moves? What would that mean for this theory?\n\nJust because they agreed on not being two hairless apes playing around with chess pieces on a table top does it really mean that reality was changed? I see it as a lack of understanding of the logical modules our brains are using to solve for a risk assessment, not the abstract rules of the game making us run. \n\nIt’s problem solving. Does solving a math problem change reality, or is it a standard set of operations that are reproducible and able to be checked by logical and mathematical proof? \n\nCan someone explain the complexities and nuances I am missing here?",

An off-the-cuff summary of how modern science works is that it cares about repeatability and observing dice after they've been cast. This doesn't account for situations that only happen once, or that have a guiding hand on them, and those are both huge blind spots because they happen all the time in real life.\n\nFor example, if you look into the old practice of St. Bernard rescue dogs with whiskey barrels around their necks, you might be tempted to point to research about alcohol dilating your blood vessels and making you freeze to death faster, and then use that to condemn the practice. You would miss the larger context where:\n\n1. You also have a big fluffy dog to keep you warm.\n\n2. Finding you was the hard part of rescuing you, so you're going to get help soon.\n\n3. Warming up your extremities will help stave off frostbite.\n\n4. Anyone who has experience in the cold knows the biggest threat you actually face is losing morale, not freezing to death. You will die before you are dead, and then no one can save you. If alcohol improves morale for you, then it's for the better.\n\nThis is a toy example of a situation where there's a guiding hand involved that causes things to work differently in concert than in isolation. Since it's a toy I don't expect most scientific minds to get confused by it, but I've seen this overall pattern repeat time and time again.\n\nThe movie Herbert West: Reanimator does a good job showing the problem. Herbert West is a mad man, but he's also capable of doing things that other people cannot, and this is what makes him different: During the climax of the movie he's not worried about dying or saving people. He is still dedicated to his research, and he sees the disaster unfolding around him as an opportunity to learn things he couldn't learn any other way, so he doubles down and keeps pushing the situation to become more absurd. That the situation cannot be repeated makes it more valuable to him, not less, so he has to get his hands dirty to make the most of it.\n\nThus TEFPOE, The Engineer's Flippant Perspective On Epistemology: If you used something to do something, then you used something to do something.\n\nYou will never get perfect information about the world, if for no other reason than your head is physically smaller than the world, so just get used to dealing with imperfect information and everything starts making a lot more sense.",

It’s about thinking you go there without taking anything with you. Your notions about starting over, or anybody’s… you don’t start over. That’s what it’s about. Every step you take is forever. You can’t make it go away. None of it. You understand what I’m saying?”\n\n“I think so.”\n\n“I know you don’t, but let me try it one more time. You think when you wake up in the morning, yesterday don’t count. But yesterday is all that does count. What else is there? Your life is made out of the days it’s made out of. Nothing else. You might think you could run away and change your name and I don’t know what all, start over. And then one morning you wake up and look at the ceiling and guess who’s laying there?”",

Are you amazed to find that even with such extensive travel, to so many varied locales, you have not managed to shake off gloom and heaviness from your mind? As if that were a new experience! You must change the mind, not the venue. Though you cross the sea, though “lands and cities drop away,” as our poet Virgil says, still your faults will follow you wherever you go.\"\n\nWith a timely as well as timeless message, Seneca reminds all readers to face the inherent difficulties in human relations rather than trying to evade them by a change of location. In his classic unorthodox style, he even quotes the head of a rival philosophical school, Epicurus, to further his arguement: \"Awareness of wrongdoing is the starting point for healing.\" Here again, he aims to point out the importance of intellectual progress over physical movement.",

Routines, by definition, do not require willpower as you go about them, and establishing good ones require strategy. \n\nWillpower is roughly a catch-all term for various executive functions. It's your ability to translate abstract mental ideas/goals into tangible action, against the wishes of various other brain/body functions (including preexisting routines/habits) that are screaming about their own priorities. \n\nSo, yeah, you don't need to rely on that if you have good strategy around your routines. But strategy comes from abstract mental ideas, which means implementing them takes willpower. I don't think the Greeks would disagree, they were just more concerned with getting to that point in the first place, partly because it is a never-ending project of always trying to be a little better than you are now, which means talking about willpower.",

However typing FU would definitely \"feel\" beneficial to my *self*\\-righteous rage *in-the-moment* contributing to my perceptions of my self-esteem and self-worth.\n\nSo I guess won't-power does have a lot more heavy lifting to do than *will*\\-power which may be considered as a misnomer for what is the psychological ([logical+emotional](https://img.myloview.com/stickers/triangle-heart-adoption-symbol-outline-icon-clipart-image-isolated-on-white-background-700-259098718.jpg)) process (or conflict) that is actually going on ;) In any case, development or actually having forethought as an instinct always helps. But how does one train or develop forethought as an instinct especially in the case where one has to counteract one's own desires and/or perceptions?

The authors contend that norm-enacting speech not only makes a norm salient in a context but also creates conversational conditions that motivate adherence to that norm. Recognizing this allows us to define call-outs and call-ins: the act of calling-out brings with it the presupposition that its target's behavior is norm-violating, whereas the act of calling-in simply presupposes its target's willingness to revise their belief. With these definitions at hand, we evaluate whether call-outs and call-ins are suitable tools for combating social injustice.",

        "body": "At first when I was watching, I turned on fullscreen before looking at the time, and then it flashed a number I thought was an 1 hour and 20 something minutes.\n\nI was thinking I really needed to introduce myself to Heidegger's work, buckled down and swallowed deeply lol\n\nIf anybody can make anything intelligible out of this then it has to be interesting. And I might elect myself to laugh at that or find some way to better appropriate my own humor directed at myself if I fail in some way at the virtual word play-or greeting with the furthest extent of intelligibility that I can summon.\n\nWhen I hold A=A as a thought in my mind by thinking it, but never inspecting the integrity of this belief, I am trying to force myself to recognize what A is when implicated by the \"=\" 'etc.'. And, I will recklessly theorize that Heidegger was reaching a little beyond intelligibility by qualifying it as the highest principle.\n\nMetaphysical equality is not a given in the universe but we grant it with our words. Equality, like identity or sameness, reaches for something we cannot verify with our being outside of thought, eg. artifactually.\n\nSo, I believe the highest principle is A=/=A in philosophical appropriation, while A=A is the highest principle in math. And, better understanding the state of understanding of math is probably the best way to read Heidegger, whom positioned himself between both worlds of logic and the analysis of systemic evolution. If I'm not mistaken the idea that ideas evolve, or imitate physical nature is still very fresh and engrossing in his time; and, its still an idea we are wrestling with today on an extremely philosophic level (perhaps even a little scary to that extent; for argument's sake the extent to which this word is *not a settled issue in philosophy*-which I believe is a placebo of thinking towards the idea of hope).\n\nThat is we can't philosophical confirm equality actually exists despite all the circumstantial evidence.. if all evidence isn't merely circumstantial.\n\nMoreover, the closer we get pursue A=A the closer we arrive at the more or most foreign and secluded truth (of math/philosophy), arguably making it 'the number one thing', that A can never equal A. And, for outsiders reading this ig, think of A as a color. If you were colorblind then red does not equal red >!unless you kill yourself!<>!..and all other color blind people like you!<>!for the sake of protecting people from this malinformation about analogies and arguable mathematics!<. Also, even if you weren't color blind you've probably seen that famous illusion with the grey squares and aqua colored cylinder that literally shows you the same color appearing as 2 different ones at the same time, in the same frame and still image. And, so, the definition of color can be necessarily confused by us changing the lighting in the room, or who/what is looking at it. Only after you take into account all the who's and what's, including the unknown who and the unknown what, can you then get a better definition of red by better understanding the effects of red, and maybe even (better) where to randomly find it in the universe because of how it decided to benefit evolution in some particular eco-system, even if you understood red and redness yet to full complete--just enough to help you find more of it where you never found it before, before you look at that location for the first time.\n\nThese 'complete sets of red' for the sake of argument may not be an entity, because we will never find that last aspect or perception of it. That's more in line with truth in the real world than truth in math. But, if math were to accept truth from the real world than it would be forced to always say 'well we're never 100% certain A=A'. But, when we are certain, perhaps after 'finding it' as a conclusion in a proof by contradiction, then it certainly does give one that high on life energy they were looking for... When one feels confident to proclaim this is equal to itself because it cannot be equal to any other thing, and leave aside all the proof.\n\nA=A is like reaching the top of the Himalayas and getting a shirt. Then you travel everywhere else with it, sometimes wearing it in order to identify with that separated identity more; perhaps some identity that is the most foundational to everything we want to fit within the scope of math.",

        "body": "Even as someone who's only read \"introduction to metaphysics,\" I feel like Hiedegger is often softened in summary. This is the closest a visual/spoken adaptation of heidegger has gotten to the aesthetic experience of reading him for me. The myopic obsession with Greek/German etymology, the vague schwarzwald-themed nature visuals with integral significance to elaborate formulations, the constant addition of near-synonomic-neologism with vastly different connotations. The vague, yet deeply homoerotic, vibes. It's all there.\n\nI had the rare opportunity of reading that book while in the arctic circle for a week long moose hunt. It was my second or third attempt at reading it, so It was unbelievabley ideal conditions. I swear on my life, I fully grasped the spirit of heidegger on that hunt. A few years later, his prose is just as opaque as it was when i first picked him up. I feel as though Heidegger's writing is a synecdoce for the absurd. You gaze into it, plying for meaning, and occasionally it will gift you with bad faith, but given a lack of devotion, that meaning turns to shit in the palm of your hands. Invert that faith, and you get the reversal of fallen-ness into authentic dasein. For that reversal to work, however, you have to endure heidegger's oppositional defiance to every thinker post plato, and  general thievery of eastern concepts decorated with quasi-important linguistic tricks. \n\nOk, maybe I'm just bitter that I'm too dopamenergic to pick up being and time. I've felt the heidegger highs when I've been able to read him. It feels like piercing the veil. You have to wonder though, are these experiences of providence truly divine, or are they the the highly ordered ramblings of a mad man. We have to remember this guy was a nazi. A nazi that was capable of channeling the divine through mind-numbing prose, but a nazi nevertheless. Could we say his political philosophy was independant of his study of ontology? I guess so? I also don't think that opinion holds water, but maybe I'm looking for faults.\n\nIdk. I almost feel like the existentialists weren't radical enough in their rejection of social norms. What is the greatest social norm, if not the self determined individual? Freedom of choice? The wholeness of the self? I know it's cringe guys, but Zizekian schizo-analysis is looking more and more appealing the more I sit with these ideas. What actual substance, what horizon does existentialism provide appart from a formal affirmation of phenomena and a hysterical structure towards a priori structures? Remember, sarte wrote a whole book on affects without accepting the unconsciouss. \n\nThe video was dope and evoked nostalgia, but I believe it is the fate of every \"the stranger\"-radicalized-armchair-philosophers to regress back to hegel. That's my teleological truth. On parmenides's godess.\n\nThe pipeline: \n\n\"the stranger\"--> \"the myth of sysiphus\"--> \"nausea\" -->...--> not reading \"being in time\" or \"being in nothingness\"-->Zizek-->not reading \"the phenomenology of spirit\"--> vague misinterpretations of dialectics--> using misreading of Freud and Lacan through Zizek to render one's self schizophrenic and impotent to effective political/social action.\n\nSuch is my fate. Sorry guys, dasein must yeild to the embrace of void-black contradiction",

I think you can think of it as a cross between Thus Spake Z (Thus Spake Me) and A Thousand Plateaus (but child-like in its approach, which I do not think is a bad thing), while being essentially the same project as Phenomenology of Spirit. I found its form and content independently though, I'm not academically trained.\n\nIt isn't like academic philosophy, it is highly personal, but breaks through to the universal. You might find its form unusual or bad; but if you find you can stand it, please give it a chance and meet it where it is at. It exists as it does for a reason. It attempts to reframe our conception of corporations, expanding the word to encompass everything created by humans, as corporations as we currently understand them make explicit what is implicit within everything else we have made. From here, it mounts a critique of society, and uses the expanded definition of corporation to argue for how to restructure things, while using the disruption of said definition to show how frameworks that aren't as broad and as specific as possible are vulnerable to being attacked using truth. The work itself performs its own philosophy. Saying to each that real change is possible, by doing and being the change.\n\nI originally started thinking and writing after some of my friends didn't think the world could be changed, even after saying that clearly things were bad but they weren't exactly sure what. I started with trying to figure out exactly what was wrong, as that seemed like a really good place to start, and then from there it blossomed into a restructuring of things from first principles.",

We don't tolerate violent crime. We don't tolerate actions against our sovereignty. We don't tolerate thievery.\n\nWhen people preach tolerance, there's always an extra little fragment that's either spoken or unspoken: tolerance *for someone who isn't harming anyone else*. Tolerance for queer people, drag queens, the racially diverse, etc. The tolerance is encouraged explicitly because the mere existence of these people doesn't cause any harms that we normally refuse to tolerate. In essence, the argument is \"there's no reason *not* to tolerate these people.\"\n\nThe apparent paradoxical nature of the idea is weaponized by people who *do* have harmful perspectives and values, but who want to trick you into thinking that the playing field is more similar than it is.\n\nIf your value system demands harms committed against others, you don't deserve tolerance. Tolerance is a means for socially protecting people who aren't dangerous. These other fuckers are dangerous and thus exempt from the core premise.\n\nEDIT: I should have included that we tolerate things that are harmful when they're necessary for the benefit of society.",

The author and the general discourse tackles it as a more regular happening when the original book treats it as a shock to the free society that someone is so intolerant that they're willing to physically act on it. \n\nThe paradox is supposed to be noticed by the free society when its enemies are acting in a legitimately damaging way and discourse is no longer possible. It's supposed to be the 'nuclear option' of a free society, where you suppress the idea because it's both damaging and there is no other recourse. Kind of like being at a pub where everyone is feeling generally fine, but there is the one drunkard who decides to throw a punch after swearing everyone off. \n\nBut the paradox itself is now being pushed around as the first step in dealing with unpopular ideas. It's legitimately going against the original point by Popper. Even the second half of the title is also going against the ideas proposed by Popper - we're supposed to be enthusiastic about the exchange of ideas as long as they stick to the realm of the verbose. Well, enthusiastic might be a bit much, but if you're aware of the paradox itself, you should be glad that it's being kept to the level of words. \n\nYou might find some ideas abhorrent but in a free society, those will be encountered. They will be present. They will make you uncomfortable and you might want to avoid them. That's completely fine and natural. You might even want to exclude those ideas and that's also fine. What is not fine is using the paradox of tolerance as a blunt instrument to remove those ideas if they're only present at the level of ideas. \n\nIt's the cost of a free society to have all kinds of ideas within it, otherwise you're only cosplaying as one. So if it's your daily stance to be 'intolerant to the intolerant', you're not a tolerant person. You're not even defending tolerance. You're just searching for a target of your impulses and the paradox offers you a guilt-free outlet to be intolerant to people that you dislike or hate.",

It doesn’t matter if I stutter when I speak or if my writing lacks the flair...  \n\nHow about you let two principles, or sets of principles coexist. One is aristotelean, popperian reasoning. A case that stands purely on rational merit lives up to this principle. A second, separate set for \"rhetorical reasoning.\" Rhetoric has been with us a long time. It's not legible in the sense that rational reasoning is sensible... but still cannot be excluded. It will leak in, if you don't make space for it. \n\nOnce you are working with separate sets, the tensions ease. You will find that humans do this stuff quite naturally. Code switching is an intuitively acquired habit. \n\nYou will also find that what counts as a rational, scientific, academically valid case varies wildly between disciplines. It's not just \"hard\" vs \"soft\"n sciences. It's not just lower and higher standards. It's a whole different set of epistemic value systems.",

If someone is already resonating with an idea, what you have to do is *get them out of the emotional brain*.\n\nUltimately, any message someone isn't already identifying with, no matter its form, is a long-term solution because ideas need time to propagate and resonate.\n\nTalking to people calmly, purposefully, slowly, grounding them back in their bodies is what has to happen to change thought patterns and re-engage logic.

That's named the \"paradox of tolerance\" invented by some guy named Popper. No further thought is necessary\n\nIt's worth noting just how much of the discourse fails to move past this niveau. It's bafflingly childish. Do a majority of people really never think even once \"what if the other guy is calling himself lovely and tolerant and me intolerant? Once I've broken the one principle separating us, how do I distinguish myself, what makes my side the tolerant one? Maybe this was the whole point to begin with?\" Evidently not.\n\nWhat's worse is how blatant it is that that set of ideas is mere rhetoric. If it was _really_ about tolerance of speech, for example, the single and main correction would be turning \"free speech\" into \"free speech, except calls against free speech, those are banned\". Simple. And yet that's not what we see - it's a combination of very enthusiastic calls against free speech plus insinuations that some other ideas will absolutely definitely lead to the abolishment of free speech later and therefore, paradoxically, free speech must be restricted (however, the direct attempts to do that themselves don't threaten it, or it's good that they do).\n\nIt's very easy to guess what process generates this particular set of ideas, and it's not a rigorous commitment to principle by serious thinkers, but rank tribal hate.

Unfortunately, you never get the intelligent people designing helpful coercive systems for the unintelligent people, you always get a political group maliciously coercing another political group. The moment you try to make existing coercive policies more objective and less targeted at political enemies, or even make them at all effective instead of a counterproductive emotional reaction (e.g. most price controls), you're engaged in politics.\n\nThen all discussion immediately turns into a shitshow - your proposal sometimes leads to weaker punishments, are you really going to let <insert group here> do whatever they want? Or stronger punishments, so you must hate <insert group here> and want them all dead. Or your policy would affect groups X and Y unequally, so, again, you hate group Y and want them all dead. Did you know that prevention isn't rehabilitative, and rehabilitation is good, therefore prevention is bad? You think intelligence is real, which has been the uncontroversial mainstream scientific opinion since forever, so you must be some kind of weird fringe bigot pseudoscientist crank. And so on.\n\nThese detailed philosophical arguments are not used in any principled way - the only real principle that remains after politics breaks people's brains is a general sense of being \"for\" or \"against\" coercion. It's better to have an equilibrium in which _all_ such policies are seen as heavyhanded paternalist control than one in which one political side gets to justify anything they want on utilitarian grounds and the other is treated like authoritarian slaveowners the moment they try. The upside of removing all harmful paternalist policies is definitely worth the downside of removing the very few good ones.",

It frequently downplays the value of education while championing IQ, and lays poor outcomes at the feet of low IQ. The issue with this argument, as with all arguments relying heavily on IQ is that there is evidence that IQ can and does increase with education and experience. \n\nIn my opinion, education is much more important than paternalism when it comes to good outcomes. This paper tries to discount the effect of education, like the following passage:\n\n>As Gottfredson (2005, p. 177) says, the problem for people with low levels of literacy “is seldom that they cannot read or write the words, but usually that they are unable to carry out the mental operations the task calls for to compare two items, grasp an abstract concept, provide comprehensible and accurate information about themselves, follow a set of instructions, and so on. This is what it means to have poor ‘functional literacy’.” In regard to understanding the dangers of smoking, almost everyone can read words about the relevant evidence, **but not everyone can correctly interpret those words and assimilate the information and figure out how to act on it to advance their own interests**. It is these people who can be said to only ‘kinda’ understand the dangers of smoking. Those with higher levels of functional literacy, however, are much more likely to genuinely understand the dangers.\n\nThis passage, surrounded by statistics about health outcomes being correlated with IQ intimates that the people who cannot interpret said instructions cannot be taught to do so. Given also is an example of IQ test problems converted into problems that one might encounter in real life:\n\n>Level 5 (Quantitative): “Using \\[a\\] calculator, determine the total cost of carpet to cover a room” (Kirsch et al., 2002, Figure 1); only 5% of white adults are classified at this level of Quantitative literacy (Kirsch et al., 2002, Figure 1.6).  \nLevel 4 (Document): Use a moderately complicated bus schedule to determine how long you would have to wait for a bus traveling from one city to another after arriving at a specified time; 19% of adults are classified at this level of Document literacy, with 77% classified below.  \n...  \nAs noted above, an example of a problem from Document interpretation level 4 is to interpret a moderately complicated, albeit realistic, schedule to figure out how long one has to wait for a bus; 77% of adults cannot reliably perform this task. **Recall that Wikler and Feinberg assumed, without citing empirical evidence, that all but the mentally handicapped are ‘competent’ to solve problems encountered in modern life. The evidence suggests that this assumption is wrong**. The differences in intellectual ability reflected in the five NALS levels have profound implications for people’s ability to solve problems that relate to important real-life outcomes. People in the lower levels face serious challenges to making informed decisions related to health, finance and other matters.",

People ought to be saved from disaster even if those who do the saving do not share the same tendencies to make the same sorts of error. This does not mean that those who are higher on the intelligence continuum should micromanage the lives of those who are lower or impose draconian ‘paternalistic’ punishments on them – that would obviously cause psychic distress to people that would outweigh any potential benefit. However, if people are prone to engage in a highly self-destructive behavior due to an inability to assess complex evidence and the paternalistic remedy is not worse than the disaster it seeks to prevent, coercive paternalism can be called for.",

All natural systems converge on the most stable long term process they can, and organic life has settled on instruction through pleasure and pain. It is required for learning, and is common for life before trying to make sense of why. \n\nThe common refutation of this idea is that \"well, continuously doing just what feels good has negative long term side effects; so we start doing different things now in order to have more overall pleasure\". That's just hedonism with math. You're still maximizing pleasure. \n\nIf we look at philosophy from faiths, we see a functionally very lazy form of hedonistic morality in evangelical Christianity. \"Here's a list of bad things. Do them and experience eternal suffering\". Perfectly adjusts the math. Just do what's net pleasant, noting that infinite pain follows a few specific actions. \n\nA more charitable view of Abrahamic religions shows sins as \"acts that, upon doing, will create a lingering pain\". Hell is, in this concept, mental anguish that needs extra effort to cleanse. Buddhism calls this suffering, and has a similar perception despite the different philosophies.\n\nAt the core, the motivation is always pleasure and pain. Good is only good because it is pleasant. That includes goods like social goods, activism, charity, selfless effort. If these things did not inspire and feel good to the people doing them, not only would they not do them, but we wouldn't respect them as much.",

I'm never clear on whether the point is some actual philosophical topic, or the simple absurdity of the author's jokes (which often come, at least for me, completely out of left field). The problem with the jokey presentation is that it raises the level of familiarity needed with the topic in order to understand if a statement or opinion (that isn't a literal quote) being attributed is an actual reflection of what someone (in this case, Thomas Hobbes) said or intended, or if it's a joke at their expense.\n\nFor a more directly substantive critique, the referencing of the prisoner's dilemma to explain the benefits of cooperation falls flat for me. My general view on it is this: *If the only part of Game Theory one understands is the \"prisoner's dilemma,\" one doesn't understand enough of Game Theory to be referencing it.* (Personally, when it comes to attempting to work out cooperation within groups that are too large for personal relationships to be the driving factor, I find the Public Goods game is more enlightening of the benefits and pitfalls. But I'm not an expert on Game Theory, either.)\n\nThere is also what I have come to find is a really common oversight in the essay:\n\n> For example I could pay you for a service you never deliver on, or kill me and steal my money or something, in which cases I cannot pay you back for your uncooperative behavior. But in a community as described, people will find out that you are the sort of person who is uncooperative, and so they will be uncooperative towards you. This creates incentives for being cooperative, even if you can get away with it in single instances.\n\nOne problem: In-group versus Out-group. Otherwise stated as: \"We cheat the other guy and pass the savings on to you.\" This undercuts this common Libertarian idea that a self-organizing community will somehow only have willing members or be free of fraud or violence. One can't rely on: \"More importantly, we can create communities where we implicitly or explicitly agree that we sanction anyone who acts uncooperatively,\" because treating out-groups the same as the in-group can be treated as a form of culpable non-cooperation with implicit or explicit group norms. Sure, there are those people for whom Jim Crow was the sole work of an evil Sovereign imposing injustice on a society that wanted no part of it... but I have yet to encounter a serious historian (or Baby Boomer, for that matter) who felt that racial animosity was imposed by government.",

He points out that this idea hinders progress and is a great example to the idea that \"done is better than perfect\"; a clear statement against shame, resentment and regret.\n\nThe video breaks down the quote, idea and thought of Epicurus as well as apply it to our current daily lives; food for thought at a time filled with many new beginnings.

Conceiving oppression as wrong because it reduces freedom is at odds with recognizing structural cases of oppression, because (a) many cases of oppression, including many structural ones, do not reduce agents’ freedom, and (b) the type of freedom reduction involved in many structural instances of oppression is not morally objectionable. If the mechanisms of oppression are sometimes indistinguishable from benign, or even ineluctable, processes of social shaping, arguments that oppression is objectionably freedom-reducing risk implausibly suggesting that socialization itself is objectionably freedom-reducing. I show how three strategies for explaining how oppression reduces freedom either fall into the trap of overgenerality, or end up appealing to values other than freedom to avoid it. I conclude by suggesting that oppression might be better thought of as an affront to equality.",

I'm in agreement for the most part.\n\nHowever I would say that equality isn't inherently morally correct. At least not in a natural, widespread, or objective way. I certainly subscribe to the belief that equality is generally a good thing for people, so I don't want to come off as anything other than discussing from a philosophical standpoint. I just think equality isn't a strong enough baseline to argue for. If we take it as an axiom that equality is morally just, then I think the argument mostly stands, although it still could use a bit more elaboration. I just don't think that's the case.\n\nEquality is a nebulous concept for most humans, and even more so, if a concept at all, for other species. It exists on a spectrum of completely unequal to completely equal, with overlapping micro-equalities to bridge the gap. Over the course of life on this planet, different groups of organisms have had unequal rights and/or access to opportunities, and some have been perceived to be less deserving of those things. For example, does a serial killer deserve the same rights as a socially well-adjusted person who has never hurt anyone and consistently does charity work? Most would say no. That's all a weak attempt at saying equality isn't completely foolproof to point to as a gold standard. Sure, with more nuanced detail of what equality looks like, maybe the argument would appear stronger. (Or who knows, maybe I just need more coffee and a nap to really understand what was written).\n\nWhat I would like to posit, is that suffering is a better axiom to stand on in order to prove that oppression is morally incorrect. Suffering is almost universally accepted as a moral negative, especially from a utilitarian perspective, and used as an axiom for most ethical frameworks. Suffering is a direct output of oppression, and is what most oppressed individuals will talk about. I think it's the most obvious drawback to oppression, and that it doesn't require additional/alternative negativities to help admonish oppression.\n\nSomething that came to mind as I responded is that oppression, equality, and suffering, could also be explained to be pieces of one bigger system, as oppression being simply the force delta of perceived inequality, and suffering being one of the outputs of oppression. To me this exemplifies suffering (or freedom) as better points in arguing the wrong of oppression as they are the output rather than the medium.\n\nI also think there could be interesting work done to fit all these pieces together into one cohesive tapestry of a framework explaining how oppression is bad from a larger perspective.",

In other words, the idea that no difference between groups renders them effectively unequal is fairly recent.\n\nIt would be interesting to see how this understanding of oppression interacts with ideas on moral luck, given that so many groups of people throughout history have had moral assessments about them impacted by factors beyond their control. Not to mention the fact that groups are commonly held accountable for non-unanimous or even minority actions; theories of oppression tend to look at clear cases of \"innocents,\" but as defined in the paper, there are certainly historical instances of oppression what were seen as legitimate sanctions against a group.",

I can be as selfish and egocentric as I want and still be incredibly altruistic because I believe that which I give out to others will eventually return to me in some form. In fact, we could argue that that's the basis for the creation of the societies we live in. We come together and forego a bit of our own personal wants and freedoms not just for the betterment of others but for ourselves as well.",

        "body": "In Twilight of the Idols, Nietzsche opens up the chapter \"The Problem of Socrates\" with a bold statement: he calls him ugly.\n\nBy itself that's not really a controversial statement: Socrates's unsightly physique is well-attested in ancient sources, and Socrates himself (with a dint of his trademark irony) even agrees with detractors who insult his looks. (His bulging crab-like eyes, for example, allow him to take a broader view of the world than those with normal, forward-facing eyes can... he says to his friend Crito.)\n\nWhat's so provocative about Nietzsche's statement is not the statement itself but rather that he uses it as an argument against Socrates. Isn't that the classic example of an ad hominem attack? You're ugly therefore you're wrong?\n\nBut Nietzsche goes deeper into it and uses the ugliness of Socrates as a springboard to critique ancient Greek culture - how Socrates and the Socrates Revolution was a symptom of decadence, of the ancient pre-Socratic Greeks losing their noble tastes, allowing themselves to be seduced by reason, allowing Socrates to convince them that from now on, they needed good reasons, solid arguments, for their way of life. The happy instinct of the powerful, that needs no justification beyond itself, now stood in need of a justification: good reasons were required for your beliefs.\n\nAnd the Greeks had Socrates to thank for that.\n\nFor Nietzsche, this is not a sign of philosophical enlightenment, but a sign of decay, of decadence, of a loss of strength; of weakness.\n\nMoreover, with Socrates, the way was paved for Plato, and his world-changing distinction between appearance and reality. The Greeks used to judge books by their covers, and Plato changed that. Now, there is this rotten, fallen, imperfect material world juxtaposed with a perfect World of Forms. For the pre-Socratic Greeks, this idea was not as forceful as it is today: appearance WAS reality.\n\nAnd only ugly Socrates, who could not compete with the strong, healthy, noble Greeks on physical terms, had to invent a kind of mental challenge: the tyranny of reason, and the prelude to the World of Forms where reason would reign supreme over all the rest. Mind over body, reason over instinct, idea over reality.",

Nietzche decries the rise of democracy, blames the Jews for introducing Slave morality to the west through Christianity (instead of, you know, the Christians. Nietzsche wasn’t living in Ancient Rome), and generally hates the idea of equality because it makes “slaves of the masters.”\n\nBut we know the truth—that the sentiment that our fathers fathers were gods among men is as old as the Iliad—and that men have been the same since the dawn of the species. That charismatic leaders will rise regardless of their capability at statecraft, that those who espouse their own greatness will exploit anyone willing or desperate enough to follow, and that these mortals of flesh and bone depend on the masses far more than the masses depend on them. \n\nThe idea that Socrates sought to upend the social order that devalued him for his appearance is childish, and I’m not sure how more people don’t see that. But if I were to stoop to be childish for a moment as well, I’m pretty sure Nietzsche would change his mind about whether the weak don’t deserve to resent their treatment at the hands of their noble oppressors if my gorgeous ass rolled up and slapped his sickly academic little butt around for a few hours.\n\nTLDR N called S ugly but I say I could kick N’s ass and I think that’d make him reassess which side of the master/slave morality he occupies.",

I'm curious if they also reported it for breaking the subreddit's rules.\n\nBut, to the point. There was a stand-up comedian I saw once, who was doing part of his set on religion. He noted that he'd encountered people on the street proselytizing, and that he'd hit upon the idea of asking them why they believed in their religion. None of them, he told the audience, said \"Because some guy on the street told me to.\"\n\nIt got a laugh out of people (I certainly found it funny), but I also started thinking about it in the broader context of philosophy more generally. People spend a lot of time telling other people to believe things, or attacking them for believing something else, without appearing to try and lead people along the path that they themselves took to their beliefs.\n\nI was reading a dead-end argument on materialism, where one person was berating another for believing only in the material world, demanding to know precisely where in the brain concepts existed. But I doubt that this person came to the idea that ideas, concepts and deities were immaterial because they couldn't prove to someone else's satisfaction that the idea of a tree resided at a precise location in their brain. But now that they'd come to that place, perhaps they couldn't retrace their steps, so beating someone up for believing something else may have been the best they could do. Even though it wasn't, as they say, super-effective.\n\nI tend to think of my belief system as a stone wall, made up of a lot of blocks, with a lot of mortar holding them all together. And when people have debated it with me, in an attempt to have me adopt their belief system, I notice that they tend to put their shoulder to one of the foundational blocks at the base, and push really hard on it, as if intending to bring the whole edifice down. But when moving a wall, especially if moving it in sections, it seems that it would make more sense to start from the top. And so I wonder if this is what effective communicators of concepts do... they attempt to clear the land from the top of the structures they want to dismantle, and then build up again.",

These personal struggles, both small and profound, are interwoven with the daily personal tragedies—the quiet frustrations and fleeting hardships of everyday life and each sends ripples through our mediums of experience. Together, they form a dynamic shaped by fluctuating influences that, though these forces often remain hidden, affect the messy course of history in ways we may not immediately recognize. As sonder reminds us, each life carries its own unique weight, shaped by both personal experience and broader societal forces; they contribute to a collectively incoherent web of systems that stretches through time, rife with the simultaneous potential for equilibrium, stagnation, growth, decay and change despite the unacknowledged impact of ignorance in all its forms; willful or not. The sprawling and nonlinear tangle of history is not easily explained by clear causalities, but by a tension between conditions and states that resists simple conclusions.\"",

Since the processes of the mind can notice and think about consciousness, then consciousness must interact with those physico-chemical processes, hence be something physic/chemical itself.

Alpha. A new star floating in the void. The corner of the eye.\n\n2. EMOTIONAL WAVES: Our feelings don't paint the whole picture of course and can be wrong. But the modern approach to Stoicism tends to want to repress our emotions as inherently damaging, when in fact we have them for a reason and can point us in the right direction of how we're actually experiencing something. Vital/Flatlining signs. The veins of the eye.\n\n3. EXPERIENCING SPECTRUM: Spectrum of all of our experiences and reflection of our experieces. Not a binary. All shades of colour, light and darkness. Maybe we can learn to dial into these opposite shades when exploring how we have or can experience something. The iris of the eye.\n\n4. NARRATIVE GHOSTS: Beliefs/Stories/Meanings that haunt us. Put there by others as well as ourselves. We may have some choice in what we see and imagine. Images that float in our eye.\n\n5. ROAD/RIVER OF ACTIONS: Our actions and reactions, running from our past, through our present and into the unknown future. Our choices and how they affect our world, and the world of others. Like a road or river running through the eye.\n\n6. UNAWARENESS: Dark inverted peaks of shadowy unknowing. Because we can't always know everything, and we all have our blind spots. But hopefully we can bring up what dwells here into awareness. The lower lashes or blind spot of the eye.\n\n7. AWARENESS: The light/lighthouse of awareness/knowledge which illuminates the true nature of things, through the scientific method and what is provable about our existence. Or at least self-reflectivity about our self-reflectivity. I think of awareness as the Existential Eye itself, so it's like an eye within an eye within an eye.... The upper lashes of the eye.\n\n8. DEATH: Awareness of inevitable dying and death. Everything will end. Putting all our actions/beliefs/thoughts/relationships into context. Allowing us to contemplate the full scope of our lives as a whole. Omega. The waning moon. The end of the eye.\n\n9. VOID/NON- EXISTENCE: The oblivion at the heart of all existence. What life, action, memory and meaning disappears into. The true death. When all existence is forgotten utterly. The black pupil/hole at the centre of the Existential Eye, sucking in the iris of experience/life.\n\n10. OTHERS: Everyone else. As they all are/have their own Existential Eyes too. Floating in space. With their own roads, feelings, narratives, experiences, unawareness, awareness, deaths and voids of meaning. Whether they realise it or not. Their actions and influence can form a web of Existential Eyes with others. Other eyes outside your Existential Eye.\n\nSo that's how I choose to make sense of life, as a meaning seeking being in a meaningless existence, with knowledge of mortality.\n\nI suppose it's a way to remind myself of all the facets of existence and how we're all lost in space, alone, together.\n\nI find that when I use it for meditation, it makes sense and helps to stop any feelings of existential panic, or at least puts the panic in context.\n\nDoes anyone else use a similar philosophy based method to help process experience?",

        "body": "**The God of Settlement: Understanding Civilization as a Self-Destructive Multi-Mind Agent**\n\nI propose a framework for understanding civilization's relationship to environmental destruction by synthesizing insights from James Scott's analysis of early state formation, Vaclav Smil's examination of material dependencies, and Joscha Bach's concept of multi-mind agents. \n\nCore thesis: The \"god of settlement\" - the emergent distributed intelligence arising from permanent human settlements - established fundamental patterns of externalized costs and mandatory growth that predate and transcend any particular economic or political system. These patterns aren't bugs but features of settled civilization itself.\n\nKey patterns that emerge from the very beginning of settlement:\n1. Resource Externalization - From the first forest clearings onward, settlement operates through systematic undervaluation of environmental costs\n2. Coerced Labor - Exploitation of unpaid/undervalued labor emerges from settlement's fundamental requirements, starting with the first states\n3. Growth Imperative - The paradox where stability requires constant expansion\n4. Population Management - The necessity of concentrated, controlled populations for maintaining permanent large-scale organization\n\nCritical insight: Later economic systems like capitalism didn't create these patterns - they inherited and optimized them. This helps explain why attempts to address environmental destruction through different economic systems often fail to address the underlying patterns established by the god of settlement itself.\n\nUnderstanding civilization as a multi-mind agent  reveals how our collective participation in state-building creates a distributed intelligence that operates through us while following its own logic. Unlike divine inscrutability, this agent's \"indifference\" to environmental destruction is comprehensible - yet understanding doesn't grant escape from its patterns.\n\nThis perspective transforms awareness of individual failings, in  e.g. consumption behavior, into a moment of metacognition - the distributed agent becoming locally aware of its self-destructive nature through its constituent parts (us).\n\nReferences:\n- Scott, James C.

        "body": "Here's an attempt at refuting John Searle's [Chinese Room argument](https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/7150/1/10.1.1.83.5248.pdf) based on the idea of gradually transforming a physical network into a simulation of itself:\n\nSearle challenges the idea of \"strong AI\" which is roughly speaking, that a machine can think and that minds are \"software\" that can represented as symbolic programs and be embodied in different physical substrates/\"hardware\", including computers.\n\nThere are two main objections given:\n\n- The substrate argument: certain properties of cognition may depend on the physical properties of the biological brain, therefore cannot be implemented in computer hardware\n- The simulation argument: a computer program that attempts to replicate human cognition is only a simulation of a mind and not an actual mind. Searle says:\n\n> The idea that computer simulations could be the real thing ought to have seemed suspicious in the first place because the computer isn't confined to simulating mental operations, by any means. No one supposes that computer simulations of a five-alarm fire will burn the neighborhood down or that a computer simulation of a rainstorm will leave us all drenched. Why on earth would anyone suppose that a computer simulation of understanding actually understood anything?\n\nSimulation requires symbolic representations of the current system state and rules for manipulating the symbols to derive future states. The thought experiment with the man in the Chinese Room is an attempt to show us that simulation of human mental phenomena in the form of a set of instructions to manipulate symbols does not produce real understanding even if the outputs are the same as the real thing, because the function of manipulating symbols according to a table of rules is a mechanical \"dumb\" process. The man in the room is clearly an analogy of a Turing machine and the symbols are the strip of tape / memory.\n\nThe substrate and simulation concerns can be considered orthogonally to each other: you could have a bio substrate/realised mind (e.g. a brain), a non-bio substrate/simulated mind (e.g. normal PC running an AI), but also a non-bio substrate/realised mind (e.g. neural network physically implemented in silicon) and even conceivably a bio substrate/simulated mind (if a Turing machine is ever implemented using a synthetic biological substrate). You can also have a mixture of bio/non-bio substrates (cyborg) or even something intermediate between a physically realised mind and a simulation (see below).\n\nMy claim is that, provided we can get past the substrate objection, it can be shown that an implementation of an artificial neural network as a physical network can be transformed into a symbol-based simulation of that network via billions of small transformations while at all times remaining functionally unchanged, and therefore the boundary between the two is vague and meaningless.\n\nThere are lots of possible objections to the idea that the physical substrate matters but to me the best one is the evolutionary argument: since evolution selects for genes based on function, we could have evolved brains with any number of different physical substrates provided they support the necessary mental functions required for survival, so why should we assume the one we happened to end up with is the only one that supports subjective mental phenomena? In any case, it seems like Searle is prepared to give ground on this:\n\n> And indeed it might be possible to produce consciousness, intentionality, and all the rest of it using some other sorts of chemical principles than those that human beings use.\n\nThis is a bit surprising because surely the only reason to entertain this possibility is because other \"chemical principles\" might produce functionally identical results with a different substrate? But Searle rejects functionalism. FWIW he also says that human brains are thinking machines and are \"digital computers\" meaning \"anything at all that has a level of description where it can correctly be described as the instantiation of a computer program.\" So possible claims that human thought is not algorithmic etc are not relevant here.\n\nAnyhow, suppose we have an advanced neural network (either scanned from a human brain or trained from mountains of data), and instead of storing it as a set of weights in VRAM in a computer, it is actually physically realised in silicon, with links between artificial neurons being actual physical connections. It is then of a different substrate to a human mind, but it cannot be said to be a simulation of a mind but an instantiation of one. This makes it not a simulation of a human mind but an analogue of it, in the same way that, say, a butane flame is not a \"simulation\" of a propane flame. There isn't really anything analogous to the man in the Chinese Room as there is no symbol manipulation taking place, the signals simply propagate physically across the network, much like in the human brain. You could do a thought experiment imaging a billion men implementing each of the billions of artificial neurons and point out that none of them understand what the network is processing, and therefore nothing in the network understands anything - but this is not convincing as an individual neuron in a human brain does not understand what the brain does as a whole, so we already have an example of understanding at the level of the whole and not the individual components. It's also no good to object that this physically realised neural network is Turing-equivalent to a single processor with a large program in memory and try to make the Chinese Room argument on that basis - the whole point of the Chinese Room argument is that functional equivalence is not enough to attribute equivalent cognitive functions to different realisations.\n\nOnce you can entertain the idea that an artificial neural network physically realised in silicon or some other substrate (e.g. \"synthetic biology\") is an actual mind - as Searle did:\n\n> Assuming it is possible to produce artificially a machine with a nervous system, neurons with axons and dendrites, and all the rest of it, sufficiently like ours, again the answer to the question seems to be obviously, yes. If you can exactly duplicate the causes, you could duplicate the effects. And indeed it might be possible to produce consciousness, intentionality, and all the rest of it.\n\n...then we can ask what distinguishes it from a \"simulation\" and how clear the boundary is. Suppose we have an artificial neural network with a billion artificial neurons and a trillion connections between these neurons: a 1:1 correspondence between \"logical\" neurons and physical neurons. What if we then re-engineered two of these neurons (out of 1 billion) so that a single physical neuron was effectively doing the information processing of two logical ones, with some kind of internal memory state to store the activation of each neuron and a control input that selected which logical neuron to activate when sending signals to the neuron. Would it then be a simulation of two neurons, or just a more complex neuron that does the job of two normal ones? If only 1 of these neurons existed in the network along with 999,999,998 normal ones, the network as a whole could not be described as simulation as its contribution to the overall output would be miniscule. What if you then replaced the other 999,999,998 neurons one at a time until you ended up with 500 million of these tandem neurons. At that point, is it a simulation or a physically realised network? What if you then took the next step, and merged these neurons one pair at a time into even more complex neurons that can handle the work of 4 of the original neurons, then 4 to 8, 8 to 16 and so on. At each step of the way it is functionally equivalent to the previous step, producing the same outputs from the same inputs. Eventually you would end up with a single processing unit and an enormous amount of memory: a classical computer running a simulation of the original network.\n\nThe fact that you can incrementally change a physically realised network to a simulated one over billions of small steps makes it completely unlike the other examples that Searle mentions. You can't incrementally change a thunderstorm into a simulation of a thunderstorm with millions of small steps, and you can't incrementally change a real fire to a simulated fire. There's no point in the transition between physically realised network and simulation that you can point to and say \"before this step it is a real network, after this step it is a simulation\". This suggests that there is no real difference: an information system simulating the processes of an information system is, in fact, performing those processes.",

I've been reading Wittgenstein and Husserl and Heidegger lately, and I've been thinking about the sorts of words we often give so much weight in these fundamental and fairly abstract conversations. I think there are certain words we use because they carry a sense of 'expectation' or 'intuitive trust' due to our familiarity with them, or the frequency with which we use them in more surface-level speech.\n\nOften though, once interrogated, I think they are revealed to be much tricker or obfuscating in ontological and epistemological discussion. Some of the things I've been contemplating are:\n\n\\- what it means to 'ground' something\n\n\\- reason, logic, knowledge of various sorts\n\n\\- subjective and objective (they seem to mean very different things, depending on context)\n\n\\- how we often want to the world as a set of static 'things' in spacetime, essentially bumping into one another\n\n\\- embodiment vs abstract\n\n\\- Tautology, aboutness, and self-referential language",

For me, that journey started when I made the conscious effort to respect religious apologists as philosophers even if I categorically disagreed with them.

Because this is, far and away, the biggest problem encountered. Considered the following:\n\n> Which begs an interesting question: what makes a good dissenter?\n\nNote that this is considered an improper usage of \"begs the question,\" because \"begging the question\" as \"'begging' someone to pose and then answer the question\" is a very modern interpretation based on a fairly literal reading of the phrase. Should I, on the basis of this, decline to see Mon0 as a \"competent dissenter?\" I mean, they don't seem to understand how \"begging the question\" is used in philosophy. But I'm not much a philosopher myself... I just understand the logical fallacy being referenced.\n\nThe first quality of a good dissenter is listed as:\n\n> Good dissenters generally needs a deep understanding of the field they are challenging, including its foundational principles and methods.\n\nBut without the relevant expertise, I can't make that determination. So my recognition and valuing of a person is likely to fall into the same trap of appeal to authority, as I'm attempting to combat. I've simply chosen a different authority. Which is why I was speaking of the use of \"begging the question,\" above. That's likely a really poor reason to discount Mon0, but it may be all a layperson has.\n\nTo the degree that the problem of requiring relevant expertise is insoluble (after all, it's why humanity developed division of labor) leaning on competent dissenters may only shift the problem.",

I think at an individual level, we’ve over moralized and overemphasized being correct.\n\n1) I think the biggest and most important question is to honestly ask yourself if the dissenter you’re listening to actually believes what they’re saying. Ask yourself the same if the dissenter is you. \n\n2) how does authority react to the dissent? Are the questions dodged? Are reasonable enough questions/criticisms painted as unreasonable? Or are they directly addressed in good faith with reason. \n\nPeople will have bad ideas. That’s unavoidable. Sometimes large groups of people will have bad ideas at the same time, including authority. If the unauthoritative dissent is wrong but becomes too popular, the authorities need to ask themselves why they’re not being trusted. \n\nEx: when Purdue Pharma falsely claimed OxyContin wasn’t addictive, the dissent that sparked awareness largely came from husbands, wives, brothers, sisters etc. who saw what it did. The medical establishment really dropped the ball on that one. The people raising awareness weren’t grifters, and the media and medical authorities responded by minimizing the problem when they responded at all.\n\nDuring Covid, I think the authorities acted as though ‘people don’t trust us because of all these crazy conspiracies’ when the truth was ‘all these crazy conspiracies are catching wind because of valid loss of trust’.\n\nTLDR: misinformation happens. Don’t overthink it. Make sure you’re saying what you actually believe. Do your best to try and sniff out when others are/aren’t. Let the process play out at a societal scale. Be relieved that you in and of yourself won’t ruin the world if you’re wrong about a thing.",

That's circular and only convincing to idiots, and humanity is slowly waking up to that.

It’s something philosophers have long wrestled with—how power structures, whether social, political, or academic, can subtly define what we know and how we know it. In this sense, dissent becomes not just a way to oppose authority, but a crucial tool for clearing space for truth.\n\nBut here’s the catch: dissent itself isn’t enough. It’s not just about challenging the dominant narrative—it’s about engaging deeply with the ideas we oppose, questioning them, and understanding them better. Socrates didn’t just ask questions to disrupt; he asked to deepen understanding, to refine ideas and push past superficial conclusions.\n\nThere’s also the tricky issue of what counts as “justified belief.” In a world where authority and power often determine what is considered true, it’s not always clear where real critique ends and empty opposition begins. As Feyerabend would argue, knowledge can’t be one-size-fits-all. We have to let multiple perspectives exist, even when they clash. So, true dissent doesn’t mean rejecting everything we disagree with—it means reflecting on why we disagree and how our beliefs fit into the larger puzzle of human understanding.\n\nAnd then there’s the Foucaultian view that power and knowledge are inseparable. The knowledge we take for granted often comes wrapped in power. The question is not just how do we dissent?, but how do we know when our beliefs are our own, and when they’ve been shaped by the systems around us?\n\nMaybe the most radical thing we can do is stop seeing dissent as just opposition, and start seeing it as reframing—questioning the very way we understand authority and truth. Only then pcan we open ourselves up to a deeper, more genuine understanding of what it means to know something, and how we can shift the structures that control what we think we know.",

I can say, something is such, and if someone disagrees I can say \"well Kant covered it in...\" and that's a short way of basically saying \"all of what Kant has to say is how I feel\" not because he's authoritative but because he makes a good argument. If someone presents a logical argument so good that I adopt it, it just saves me (and everyone else) time to have this reference even if it means developing a sense of authority around it.\n\nThis extends into different sciences too, like physics especially. If I say something massive cannot exceed the speed of light \"because Einstein said so in his theories of relativity\" I am leveraging his entire works which are pretty sound. This doesn't feel like an appeal to authority to me here\n\nSo if questioning authority is broken down into questioning those works that built the sense of authority, then that's great and people try to do that all the time. But then a lot of people will read it as questioning authority in the way of \"why should we trust that massive particles can't go faster than c? Just because Einstein said it?\"",

I recently read a book (assigned by a book club) that talks about effective ways to change people's minds, and it brought up some long-standing questions I have around the methods and objectives of philosophical (and idealogical/political/cultural) debate and argumentation more generally.\n\n\"Rhetoric\" is sometimes positioned as antithetical to philosophy, but it's unavoidable when communicating. People (philosophers included) inevitably shape and shade their words in ways that will give their arguments the best chance of being given \"a fair shake\" by their audience. Actually, I'd argue that most people (and philosophers) go beyond that and actively present their arguments in ways designed (albeit perhaps not always with conscious intent) to make those arguments as appealing and persuasive as possible, and thus more and more rhetoric starts to creep in around the edges.\n\nAnd then, aside from the question of the inevitable rhetoric which occurs within philosophical discourse, there's the ethics of actively trying to \"change people's minds\". This is often seen as a benign or laudable undertaking, but it seems like the most effective ways to change other people's minds are often ways of bypassing analysis and evaluation. Rhetoric is a key feature here, but it goes beyond that into social, emotional, and relational wavelengths. Is cultural pressure (activism, media campaigns, etc) ethical simply because it's in service to the \"right\" beliefs? \n\nAnd what are the ethics of leveraging a personal (emotional or social) connection to someone - which is by far the most effective way to change a single person's mind - if such approaches are effective *regardless* of the *content* of the beliefs/arguments in question? There's a circularity to saying that persusion is ethical when the belief being advanced is \"good\" and unethical when the belief being advanced is \"bad\".",

This insight emerged from my own emotional journey with consumption choices. My initial anger at society's environmental indifference changed when viewed through Bach's framework of distributed agency and religious experience.\n\n The rage I felt toward collective inaction began to mirror the anger believers direct at God when confronting inexplicable suffering. Yet this parallel reveals a crucial difference: while the believer struggles with divine inscrutability, we face a god of our own making - one whose logic we can grasp through our shared commitment to state-building, even as this understanding fails to free us from its influence.\n\n\nDevelopment:\n\n1. Scott's analysis of how grain agriculture created specific dependencies that enabled state formation provides the historical foundation, though he doesn't directly address the implications for modern environmental crisis.\n\n\n2. While Smil demonstrates modern civilization's fundamental dependence on energy-intensive materials like steel and concrete, I extend this to argue these dependencies represent a deeper continuation of the agricultural trap Scott describes.\n\n\n3. Bach's framework of gods being multi-mind agent s, developed in his discussions of consciousness and reality (Bach, 2022), can be applied to civilization itself. In his Lex Fridman interview (#101), Bach explores how distributed agency relates to religious experience and normative power. \n\nBuilding on this, I argue this reveals a form of determinism emerging not from natural laws or divine will, but from the emergent properties of our shared agreement upon living as a state-building organism. Unlike a divine being whose apparent indifference might serve some higher purpose, this distributed agent's \"indifference\" to environmental destruction is an expression of its inherent self-destructive nature.\n\n\n4. Individual ethical choices become moments of metacognition where the distributed agent becomes aware of its own self-destructive nature through its individual nodes (us). While none of these authors explicitly makes this connection, synthesizing their insights reveals why the emotional response this generates differs fundamentally from religious anger at divine indifference: we aren't raging against incomprehensible divine mystery but against a pattern whose logic we can grasp yet remain bound by.\n\n\nAnticipated Objections and Responses:\n\n1. Objection: This is merely fatalism disguised as analysis\n\n   Response: Understanding the material basis of our predicament differs fundamentally from fatalism - it reveals the concrete rather than mysterious nature of our constraints\n\n\n2. Objection: Alternative materials and technologies could break these patterns\n\n   Response: All proposed alternatives remain bounded by the fundamental material constraints of large-scale civilization\n\n\n3. Objection: This understanding should enable systemic change\n\n   Response: The tragic nature of this knowledge lies precisely in how comprehension doesn't grant escape from the material conditions that bind us\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\nScott, James C.

        "body": "Morality and responsibilities vs Goals and success \n\nSo I was reading Jackie Chan's life story and got to know about his parents' story.I will provide a brief overview of how they met :\n\nJackie's father was a nationalist spy whose wife died due to cancer. Soon, he abandoned his two sons to save his life and left them to fend for themselves. In Shanghai, he met Jackie's mom, who was a widow with two daughters whose husband had died in an air bomb raid. Soon, when communist was spreading, Jackie's dad left for Hong Kong, and a few years later, Jackie's mom abandoned her daughters and left for Hong Kong, too, where they had jackie in 1954.\n\nHere, jackie was enrolled in an academy and leaned kungfu while his half brothers (10 and 8 years old) were literally begging for food and his older half sister who was 12 at time was working in a child labour factory to provide for her 4 yr sister and grandmother. Eventually, Jackie gained success and became famous, and his parents also got to enjoy his wealth. Eventually, the parents reconnect with abandoned children 38 years later. It was found that one of his half brother was a postman, and the other worked a pig farm, and the half-sisters had also married and had children of their own.\n\nHere, we see that even though the parents abandoned their children, they still lived amazing lives while the abandoned children lived below average lives. Had they done what was morally correct and not left their children, would they have been able to live such great lives, and we would not have gotten Jackie chan.\n\nHere arises the question: Does morality hold us back, and when it does, should we look out for ourselves or do the \"right\" thing.\n\nDoes achieving success/goals/happiness the greatest thing even for yourself even if it's at somebody's cost ? Does this justify all the wives who leave their husband for a richer man or the men who leave their wives for a more beautiful woman or the parents who abandon their children to have fun.\n\nShould one do what makes them happy, or should one follow their responsibilities and do what is \"right\" even if it requires sacrifice.\n\nAlso, is anyone objectively wrong or does success defines who was right or wrong. I think it doesn't matter if you were the one who betrayed or the one who was betrayed or done wrong with, as long as you become successful and achieve your dreams, you win. Here, even though Jackie's parents were people who abandoned their children, they still lived better lives and basically won in life because Jackie became successful. Jackie's success made their wrong decision their right one. \n\nSo whoever wins wins, I guess. Does morality even have a role to play like we have been made to believe, or does success define everything.\n\nPeople who have been done wrong often get into this \"oh poor me\" thinking that because they were wronged so justice will come to them, or karma will help them, while in reality, it is different and other might still live great. So these people should work harder so that they can become more successful than the other party and live a happier life.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this.",

        "body": "War in our hearts: violence that consumes us, even without conflict.\n\nI consider violence to be an inherent component of human nature. Like other fundamental instincts, such as hunger or the search for safety, violence is part of our biological and evolutionary heritage. It played a crucial role in the survival of our ancestors, allowing them to defend themselves, protect their resources and defend themselves against other human groups. This violence is therefore rooted in our deepest instincts and does not simply disappear with the evolution of society.\n\nHowever, rather than seeking to “temper” or suppress it, humans’ cognitive and social capacities have acted as catalysts for this violence. Instead of eliminating it, these abilities allow it to be expressed in more complex, subtle and sometimes socially acceptable ways. Our brains, capable of rationalizing and planning, allow us to use violence in a more strategic way. Rather than resolving a conflict through direct physical confrontation, we can resort to more indirect forms of violence: economic, psychological, or even digital.\n\nIn this sense, I do not see violence as a phenomenon that we necessarily seek to \"moderate\" or eradicate, but rather as something that we channel, whether in sports competitions, video games, or relationships. of power in modern societies. These forms of violence are not less violent, they are just different. They allow the individual or a group to manifest their desire for domination, control or security in a less physical but just as meaningful way.\n\nThe evolution of human societies has not abolished violence, it has transformed it. Instead of open confrontations, we have learned to express this violence through mechanisms of social pressure, economic competition, or psychological manipulation. This does not mean that violence has disappeared, but simply that it has become more subtle, often camouflaged in more socially accepted or invisible forms.\n\nWhat is particularly hypocritical in our modern societies is this facade of civilization and pacifism that we display while continuing to fuel violent mechanisms in different forms. Take, for example, war video games, which sell extremely well around the world. These games, which simulate violence in a very realistic and immersive way, are a huge market. However, the same society that consumes this virtual violence en masse is the one that displays its refusal of real violence. We celebrate war and destruction through media, movies and video games, but we condemn war when it breaks out in the real world. This is blatant hypocrisy: we have accepted violence in an entertaining form, but refuse to confront it when it manifests in reality.\n\nIt also reflects a historical change. In the past, war was part of people's daily lives. It was not only a political reality, but also an economic, social and even cultural necessity. Societies were constantly at war, and violence was a natural response to conflicts over territory, struggles over resources, and the assertion of power. Violence was a different need, a constant in daily life. Today, although war is no longer as omnipresent and direct, it remains present in forms of institutionalized violence, such as economic war, geopolitical conflicts or even internal social tensions.\n\nIn modern societies, rather than suppressing this violence, we have transmuted it. It is no longer an immediate need for survival or the conquest of territory, but a hidden force hidden behind mechanisms of power, inequalities and political manipulation. Our societies use violence in more refined and sometimes more effective forms, but always in the service of domination and control.\n\nIn conclusion, human violence has not disappeared. It simply morphed and hid itself under layers of legitimacy, justification and rationalization. What is hypocritical in our modern societies is this desire to deny violence while continuing to use it, in different forms, to maintain social, economic and political order. While we condemn war and open acts of violence, we celebrate them through video games, movies and media. We have created a society where violence is both accepted and rejected, visible and invisible, but always present, acting in more subtle and insidious forms.",

        "body": "Consciousness: An Emergent Structure of Matter and Energy\n\nConsciousness, understood as our ability to perceive and reflect on the world and ourselves, is not an isolated or mystical phenomenon, but the result of the complex interaction of matter, energy and our physical and mental qualities. Consciousness, far from being a unique or special phenomenon, is an emergent property that directly depends on our physical disposition and the conditions that surround us.\n\nThe Nonexistence of Absolute Originality\n\nTo understand this concept, it is essential to understand that there is no \"absolute originality\" in our subjective experience. Everything we perceive, think or imagine is based on what we have previously experienced or on the way our senses interpret the material world. Consciousness is not a completely new creation or separate from the rest of the universe; rather, it is a construction based on matter and interactions with our environment.\n\nThis lack of absolute originality implies that our subjective experience, although it may seem unique and individual, is a reiteration of previous perceptions and interpretations. The matter and energy that make up the universe are organized in ways that allow the emergence of consciousness, but what we experience is not an independent creation, but a series of responses to stimuli, circumstances, and physical qualities of our being.\n\nConsciousness: Dependent on the Physical and the Material\n\nConsciousness is not something that arises from nothing or is an independent entity. It completely depends on our physical constitution and the environmental conditions around us. Our primary instincts, such as the need to feed or reproduce, are the basic foundations of our existence, from which more complex sensations such as affection, pain or pleasure derive.\n\nThese instincts not only ensure our survival, but shape our perceptions and emotional responses. The most complex sensations, such as love or empathy, are constructions derived from these basic instincts, shaped by our cognitive abilities and the environment that surrounds us. It is through this relationship between the physical and the psychological that our subjective experience is generated. Without the interaction between these elements, consciousness could not exist in the form we know it.\n\nThe Illusion of the Unique\n\nA fundamental part of our conscious experience is the illusion of the \"unique.\" We believe that our mind is special, that our consciousness is unique, and that our way of experiencing the world is unrepeatable. However, this perception is an illusion derived from the difficulty of understanding how consciousness emerges and the impossibility of directly experiencing the consciousness of another being.\n\nConsciousness is not something exclusive to human beings, nor is it a phenomenon reserved for the most complex organisms. In fact, everything in the universe, at its core, is made up of energy and matter, arranged in various ways that give rise to different degrees of consciousness, or what we could call \"sensitivity.\" A rock, for example, is made up of matter and energy, but its structural arrangement does not allow for a subjective experience. Although it could be said to have \"potential\" for consciousness, its energy is not organized in the same way as in living beings, which limits the possibility of perceiving or experiencing the world.\n\nMatter and Energy: The Foundation of Everything\n\nEverything in the universe is made up of energy, and this energy is organized into various forms that generate what we perceive as matter. Consciousness, therefore, is not something foreign to matter, nor something that emerges from a mysterious and independent force. It is a property of matter and energy organized in a particular way. Without the right environment and without the right physical capabilities, consciousness could not exist.\n\nOur subjective experience is ultimately a manifestation of the energy that makes us up. The human mind, in its complexity, allows us to create complex mental constructions and develop reflective consciousness. However, all this is possible only thanks to the basic instincts of life, which drive us to act to ensure our survival and well-being, and the ability to perceive the material world through our senses.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn short, consciousness is not an isolated or mystical phenomenon, but an emergent property of the interaction between matter, energy and our physical and mental capacities. There is no absolute originality in our perceptions; Everything we experience is based on what we have learned and how our body and mind respond to stimuli from the environment. Consciousness does not arise from nothing, but depends on the material structures and the basic instincts that we have as living beings. This reflection allows us to understand that we are not unique and special beings, but that we are part of a complex network of material and energetic interactions, in which consciousness is just one more link in the chain.\n\n\n---",

However, imagine the author is also putting their own ideas into the book. They already know beforehand the general idea of the book and already have something valuable to contribute. Imagine the author is also reading through the final product to make sure they agree with everything in the final draft.

That is \"good\" is more fundamental than well-being, if I am doing correct argumentation here.\n\nDiscovery can also contribute to well-being, if we don't just agree that it is some form of unvalued/unknown good >!(I might on other occasions seize some moment to argue goods can be valued and unknown; for now I'll only mention)!<, but our avoidance of pain and pleasure can either just be simply irrelevant towards discovery if not what creates opportunity for well-beings in others, however instrumentally or not. I'm not sure if we can meaningfully talk about primary goods at the level of discovery since you are probably dealing with a healthy amount of the unknown and proverbial void/abyss, but that's where I would like to go with *said* argumentation on some other occasion. We might look at other places (eg. workplaces) and goods where this could be true but discovery to me seems to be the most poignant one to immediately deal with.. maybe because there's some value in teasing apart the contingency of good(s) that comes with a discovery - 'you don't know what you don't know' despite however good it may be.\n\nBut, the value of knowledge is mostly in translation. It's about 'starting' with things that are 'effible' and tangible, or working towards (either of) those as an end. Possibly asking, 'is all knowledge itself, and not just some form of it, (eg.) explainable?' which I don't think it is. So, if I'm assigning preferences to knowledges then one huge factor to me, maybe more as of late, to personally note, has been 'will I be able to explain anything I have done after I have done it'. Sometimes the answer is 'no', though it can feel like most of the time, so I just have to settle for some form of acceptable translation that may lose data along the way, or even cause some miscommunication by virtue of provisioning any form of translation. Tangentially again, there might be a need to argue about how immersion can separate a translation from a grouped 'trans-linguistic' explanation.",

You can basically ask people to self-define how others and how they see themselves, by selecting as many out of maybe 100-200 \"words\" which are ordinarily used to describe a person, like \"ambitious\" might be a choice, \"intrepid\" is another choice, and then you'll have like \"reserved\" or \"included.\"\n\nI'd rather see this type of philosopher on like BigThink or doing a short piece for like Vanity Fair.\n\nBecause why can't we have a conversation around people's attitudes towards business and research, and then how they actually view or believe that part of the world operates?\n\nAnd so yes - this is already narrowly a utilitarian view.

        "body": "\"How does the concept of the Panopticon relate to (contemporary) society as a whole?\" I love this question. Foucault suggests that the constant surveillance of the Panopticon can lead to self-regulation and conformity; the \"prison guard\" is essentially and efficiently internalized. But in the digital age, the effectiveness of this “digital Panopticon” is more complex. While it's true that surveillance mechanisms like social media algorithms, data tracking, and government monitoring can create a climate of self-censorship, it’s not clear-cut that they always achieve the desired level of control.\n\nOn the one hand, the constant surveillance in digital spaces certainly encourages conformity. Users often tailor their behavior and opinions based on what they think will be socially acceptable or attract attention, leading to a more sanitized and conformist digital public sphere.\n\nHowever, the digital Panopticon is not foolproof. People often find creative and subversive ways to resist surveillance and to express themselves in highly non-conformist ways. Tools like VPNs, encrypted messaging apps, anonymous browsing, and anonymous profiles allow users to maintain a level of privacy and evade monitoring. Furthermore, many users engage in forms of “digital deviance”—ranging from meme culture to hacking, anonymous activism, or even creating alternative online spaces where norms of surveillance are subverted. These acts of resistance demonstrate that, despite pervasive surveillance, the digital world is also a space where privacy and subversion are actively contested.\n\nIn this sense, while the digital Panopticon may create certain pressures for conformity, it doesn’t always work to fully control or suppress individuality. The constant surveillance creates a push-pull dynamic: on one hand, it fosters self-regulation; on the other, it sparks creativity and resistance. People aren’t just passive subjects of surveillance—they actively engage with, and often push back against, the systems of control that seek to discipline them.\n\nThis approach acknowledges that while surveillance might create conformity, it also invites subversive and creative responses, showing the tension between discipline and resistance in a digital society.",

        "body": "Abstract: \n\nDiscipline and Punish is Michael Foucault’s most famous book. In this book, he traces the evolution of the Western penal system and the changes in the treatment of criminals. \n\nBeneath the surface, Foucault makes a much deeper analysis of where power lies in society and how it’s always closely connected to Knowledge. He argues that power and knowledge are inseparable and constantly reinforce each other.\n\nA quick example would be that the people in power create knowledge because they’re in a position to observe and study criminals. This allows them to better understand criminal behavior and find more efficient ways to control it.\n\nThis knowledge, in turn, strengthens power by improving the effectiveness of disciplinary practices, creating a feedback loop.\n\nFoucault expands this argument beyond prisons, showing that the connection between power and knowledge applies to all institutions in society. He argues that the rise of the modern prison led to the emergence of a disciplinary society.\n\nThe modern prison marked a complete shift in the forms of punishment. In the 18th and 19th centuries, penal reforms led to an evolution of punishment, from being focused on inflicting pain on the body of the criminals to disciplining and reforming their behavior. \n\nSo how did the modern prison lead to the rise of a disciplinary society?",

        "body": "For those interested David Garland wrote an excellent critique of Focault's work in: Foucault's \"Discipline and Punish\"--An Exposition and Critique, which by the way shows the large gap between science and philosophy.\n\n\"In particular I will argue that neither punishment nor penal history can be wholly understood in terms of power or politics and that the attempt to analyze them in these terms has led to a number of serious errors in Discipline and Punish.\"\n\n\"As we saw, Discipline and Punish locates this historical development between about 1750 and 1820 and accounts for it primarily in terms of a strategic shift in the mode of exercising power. This explanation and periodization has been challenged on a number of counts by the work of Pieter Spierenburg,28 which argues that the abolition of the public execution should not be viewed as an independent event but instead as one stage in an extended process of change which brought about the privatization of punishment and a reduction in the display of suffering. This series of events began about 1600 when there was a sharp decline in the judicial use of mutilation and maiming in the European countries and proceeded in gradual stages (the removal of permanent scaffolds, the ending of the routine exposure of corpses, etc.) until by the 19th and 20th centuries most of these nations had altogether abandoned corporal and capital punishments. Viewed in these terms, the changes Foucault describes were already well under way during the Ancien Regime and appear to have been bound up with developments which were not entirely to do with power or politics. In this respect, Spierenburg sets out a strong case arguing that the decline in penal suffering and publicity was linked to general changes in sensibility and attitudes towards violence which can be traced over the same extended period—these cultural changes being in turn linked to the formation of states and their internal pacification.29 More recent work by John Beattie on criminal justice in England between 1660 and 1800 also questions the periodization set out by Foucault in this respect.\"\n\n\n\n\"Whereas for Foucault leniency in punishment is understood as a ruse of power, allowing a more extensive form of control to take hold, for these other accounts it is viewed as a genuine end that was sought after, along with others, for reasons of genuine benevolence or religious conviction. That such intentions sometimes resulted in the kind of outcomes that Foucault describes is not denied by these accounts. Indeed it is precisely this problem of distorted, unintended outcomes that they focus on, showing how the dictates of \"conscience\" can in practice become routines of \"convenience\" for other purposes. But they stress nonetheless that these motivational patterns and ideologies did have real effects and are therefore an important factor in understanding penal institutions and the process of penal change. Moreover, as Spierenburg points out, it is perfectly possible to combine a desire for more humane treatment with a demand for greater control, and there is no reason why one should be reduced to the other.\"",

It's not really a true analysis of society, in my opinion. \n\nThe thing is... ***Panopticon failed***. The \"reformatory\" model of prison and judicial punishment failed. Criminology, as Foucault and this essay point out, became a source of information for policing and social policy. It never succeeded at reforming prisoners... or turning prisons into reform/rehabilitation institutions... so it found a different job. \n\nMaybe in Foucault's time the reformatory ideal was still alive. Maybe in rhetorical discussions about prisons reformatory ideals still held water... but they were never a working system. Prisons never were effective at enrolling criminals and graduating productive society members. Those were ideals. Old hopes for what modern sciences could achieve. \n\nThat makes the last part argument of this bogus, to me. If the Panopticon project had been a marvelous success, maybe it would have gone on to inform surveillance capitalism. It didn't. The theory or Panopticon did not succeed in practice. \n\nCompanies/CEOs try to run surveillance strategies all the time. Screen trackers and whatnot.

We debate this sort of thing a lot as it pertains to medical insurance in the USA but this is an issue in any healthcare system that requires triage, which is every healthcare system in the world.\n\nThe second problem that I personally see is that if you as a human being are affirmatively ending someone else's life, that is a moral issue that will potentially haunt you - did you do the right thing? was the person savable? was their time on this plane not ready yet and you took them too soon?

Progress and novelty, as well as preservation and reform are simply too abstract to be evaluated wholesale. Second, it is not obvious these ideas are even incompatible. According to the understanding of progress and reform I am familiar with, most if not all progressive forms of social change are instances of reform. I also do not see why social progress, say of a more equal distribution of wealth and power along gender and racial lines, is not compatible with \"lasting stability\". If power and wealth are unfairly distributed, then class resentment will fester which in turn will lead to instability. I find the opposing of these only apparently conflicting values into two distinct worldviews to be ideological rather than philosophical. Philosophy should question the logical relation between values that often knotted together in the same dispositions and attitudes. If philosophy simply accepts as fact that values are related to one another as they appear to be within cultural debates, then philosophy becomes rationalization of ideologues rather than genuine thought.",

The downside is that philosophers are often lonely. Reading in solitude while wrestling with your own thoughts is difficult. We do discuss and debate our ideas with others at conferences and symposia, but these peers, invaluable as they are, are bounded by many of the same constraints we are, living and thinking in our own brief historical moment. To overcome this myopathy of the mind, I stumbled upon an unexpected hack: not just reading the ancients, but becoming friends with them. \n\n>The medieval Japanese Buddhist philosopher Kenkō [described](https://cup.columbia.edu/book/essays-in-idleness/9780231112550) this practice as follows in his free-flowing brush style: “The pleasantest of all diversions is to sit alone under the lamp, a book spread out before you, and to make friends with people of a distant past you have never known.” The medieval Italian poet and philosopher Petrarch not only wrote letters to his living friends, but also to the dead, such as Cicero, who lived 1,400 years before. In her biography of Rahel Varnhagen, an 18th-century German writer and salon host, Hannah Arendt called her “my closest friend, though she has been dead for some hundred years.” \n\n>Once you spot these friendships with the ancients, you start to see them everywhere (I [wrote](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-the-american-philosophical-association/article/friendship-with-the-ancients/AE999D0C3C814614138EEA6A30BBFC7B) more about them recently in the *Journal of the American Philosophical Association*). What do philosophers get out of not merely reading old philosophy texts but also befriending their authors? How does one even do this, given that the other person is, well, dead?",

There are patterns of thought, humans always trying to justify 'transcending' to some other plane of existence, humans trying to reason about the hardwork that must be done in each day, humans contemplating what it means to be.   When you look through history you can see that we have not changed much at all.\n\nBut this should be reassuring!  The Man of yesterday struggled just as you do.  What this provides to us is great insight into ontology in that we can see the pattern of thought and struggle throughout history, and it's similarity, and be able to narrow down a more fundamental ontology of what it means to be a person.  And we have found what people seek through various scientific endeavours and philosophical thought.  We know that people crave projects that reflect their authentic selves, we know people desire freedom, we know that people yearn for community and belonging, we have reasoned that we are ultimately in control of what we choose to do, we know what a person needs for a satisfying quality of life.  What remains is to enact an education so that we can finally mature out of our adolescence that still relies on some parental figure to guide us.  We know what to do, we have countless years of wisdom that has taught us.",

        "body": "This is largely a correct article, but not a very good one. At the very top of the article, there's a little blurb explaining that the article concludes the killing was wrong; when I saw that, I rehearsed my rebuttal in advance: *By failing to prevent the injustices of the private health insurance sector, the state abdicated its right to a monopoly on violence in enacting justice; thus a degree of vigilantism is permissible.* Then I read the article.\n\nThe author wades through a mire of trivialities (\"is fraud bad? how bad is it, if it's leading to people's deaths? does it matter that fraudulent denial of treatment does not, itself, cause the disease to begin with?\") He eventually concludes that, despite everything, a \"legitimate\" state is entitled to a monopoly on violence in pursuit of enacting justice, so the shooting would not be justified one way or another. Here are the article's final sentences:\n\n> A government that consistently and systematically reneges on its duties to protect rights within a particular domain, thereby weakens the exclusionary power of the reasons private citizens have to refrain from acting unilaterally within that domain. In such a case, the government loses legitimacy within that domain. With respect to health insurers, we are still, I believe, in early days; for example, the use of AI is a relatively new phenomenon for which regulations have yet to appear. But we may yet get to the point where it becomes clear that the government will never be willing or able to regulate these industries in the ways that morality requires and that the people demand.\n\nFor an article which spends so much time ironing out trivialities in precise detail, a statement like \"[w]ith respect to health insurers, we are still, I believe, in early days\" is kind of insane to me. AI? Who's talking about AI? Private health insurance did not wait for the invention of ChatGPT to start unjustly denying claims. Private health insurers have been hurting and killing people by denying coverage for for decades, and the government has proven unwilling or unable to prevent it. Now come the interesting questions: Are things bad enough to justify vigilantism? When, and to what degree? Does the need to enact justice outweigh the possible harms caused by normalizing vigilantism?\n\nBut these are not questions the author is interested in answering. They'd rather answer questions like, \"if you defraud someone out of life-saving treatment, are you responsible for their death?\" And I'm sorry, but I find the answer to that question obvious. I'm not saying elementary ethics aren't worth discussing, but this is not an elementary case. The key issue here is big and thorny, and after 3,600 words of very rigorous reasoning, this article walks right up to the edge of the big questions and says \"hmm, I feel like we're not there yet\" based on nothing but vibes. They've got all the material to mount a defence the killing (or to contest such a defence), but they just can't bring themselves to take that final step and argue that the government has lost a degree of legitimacy by failing to reign in the health insurance sector. They stop, apropos of nothing, right before the finish line. Nothing they say is really incorrect, but it all feels cowardly to me.",

Denying claims is par for the course. The issue, rather, is whether UHC denied *medically necessary* claims.**\"**\n\nThis is, I feel, the first philosophical claim he makes, but it requires a presumption that isn't defended in the piece. His entire argument is predicated on the *fraudulent* elements of the system. This isn't a philosophical argument which Bazargan-Forward (BF) puts forward, but a legal one. It circumvents the entirety of the argument that those who have celebrated this action are making by focusing on a class action law suit, rather than what may be more aptly described as \"the insurance zeitgeist.\"\n\nBF pigeonholes the discussions by *preempting* any actual philosophical discussion worth having. Yeah, sure, in a world where we have unanimous agreement that denying medical coverage is acceptable, or having a business model **predicated** on denying medical coverage is acceptable, there's no way to come to the conclusion that Mangione's actions could be found anything but morally bankrupt.\n\nBut if we step back and actually look at the discussion happening, rather than what BF **prefers** to discuss - an presumption that's unassailable without being accused of \"not engaging with his argument\" - we see what people have expressed in shorter posts than this.\n\nPeople celebrate killings all the time. With regularity. The current top comment references Gary Plauche, who often gets posted as an exemplar of how people think undesirables should be dealt with. His *retributive* act is celebrated. We have the celebration of those exonerated legally through self-defense, such as Daniel Penny or Kyle Rittenhouse, whose killings people champion in some circles. People celebrate killing *non-stop*, I'd argue.\n\nIf Mangione is found innocent through jury nullification, does he become post facto morally justified? Authorized by popular will? The law will have found he committed no wrong. Much like the hypothetical in section 4 where the Government fails to do anything about a Brian Thompson proven to be killing people through fraudulent denials, a citizen *could* be morally justified, does a citizen become authorized through ratification of the act by popular will? What of the State captured by insurance systems, denying claims without being fraudulent due to corrupt approvals? Does not the citizen maintain a right to justice, denied by the tyrant?\n\nBF engages with nothing in this essay, and says less. It's a recounting of a court case and a \"well actually, Brian Thompson is exonerated from the harm he did because Capitalism exists.\" This is hardly a philosophical argument. It's just reification through restatement.",

The only way it can be avoided is if Corporate America changes from, \" Greed is good,\" to a philosophy that really would make America great.!<\n\nFor more than fifty years, the United States has been in a class war. It actually dates back to the Powell Memo¹ of 1971. Read it and you'll understand that the purpose was to turn the middle class into the working class, and as many of them into the working poor, a phrase that has only come into our lexicon during the 1980s. \n\nJFK said, “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable.²\" That was in 1962. A decade later, the tyrants had already started.\n\nYes, there has been a class war going on for over half a century, but the only ones using offensive attacks have been those in power: now they are afraid that they will be in the cross hairs. If you go through some of the posts in other subreddits like r/law or r/antiwork, you'll notice several that point to NY Governor setting up a hotline for nervous CEOs afraid they're next. Besides Thompson, a Nigerian bank CEO was murdered in California earlier this year and a founder of Cash App last year.\n\nBy following the philosophy of greed, they have made millions suffer over the decades. Had they ignored, \"Greed is good, and worked to build their companies and the communities they served. This would not be a problem. Instead, the execs chose to line their own pockets while paying a less than livable wage and made themselves a target.\n\nIn 1933, FDR said:\n> In my Inaugural I laid down the simple proposition that nobody is going to starve in this country. It seems to me to be equally plain that no business which depends for existence on paying less than living wages to its workers has any right to continue in this country. By \"business\" I mean the whole of commerce as well as the whole of industry; by workers I mean all workers, the white collar class as well as the men in overalls; and by living wages I mean more than a bare subsistence level-I mean the wages of decent living³.\n\nToday, Corporate America has chosen to not only not pay livable wages, they have chosen to pay less than subsistence wages. How? Lobbying in DC and state capitols to keep wages low. Has it worked? 37 states, territories, and districts only have the federal minimum wage: a number that has not budged in 15  years. Worse, tipped employee wage has been held at $2.23/hr since 1993. Sure glad the cost of living hasn't gone up since then.\n\nEverything has a reason. I started sounding an alarm about a civil war coming to the US by 2050. I've said it several times over the last year as a prediction, only to have some posts removed for inciting violence. I'll post it here and you decide.\n\nIt will take two people at the top. The one with foresight and the strategist leader. \n\nThe one with foresight will likely target CEOs and C-suite executives. We've already seen what happens when 1 executive is gunned down in broad daylight. More can be expected. \n\nNext, the rebels will target the billionaire class. It could be the billionaire themself, or one of their family. \n\nThey would follow up with the financial institutions. A Ryder truck bomb at the NYSE, a suicide bomber at BofA HQ, and so on. Or, they could go for a triple-play of bombing a shareholders' meeting, eliminating CEOs, billionaires, and some executives from the equity companies deeply invested in whatever corporation is having the meeting. \n\nIf by the third step, Corporate America hasn't changed their philosophy from \"Greed is good,\" to making the world,  and America, a better place, the rebels will continue going over the steps several times, and finally turn their cross hairs to elected officials.\n\nWashington officials may be to sheltered for that, but when they visit their home states? Likewise, the rebels will realize that their home problems are fueled by local and state officials. A mayor that pushes for luxury homes while there is a homeless problem would be targeted. States with minimum wage at the federal level? Yup, reps and even the governors will become targets.  In a civil war, stealth is no always needed. \n\nI'm not advocating violence,  but putting this out there as a warning. This is how the civil war will be won. Will the FBI contact me? Possibly. Will they learn anything? Very little as I'm a disabled shut-in. No leader. \n\n\n\n1: Powell Memo: https://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/powellmemo/\n\n2: JFK quote. https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191843730.001.0001/q-oro-ed5-00006245#:~:text=Those%20who%20make%20peaceful%20revolution%20impossible%20will%20make%20violent%20revolution%20inevitable.\n\n3: FDR quote. http://docs.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/odnirast.html",

The individual conscience is immune from dogma? The individual conscience is immune from tradition? These two are simply not self evident at all. I would presuppose the opposite even. And the individual conscience is immune from external determination? How would you even hypothetically know? How do you decipher the origins or your beliefs? \n\nIs it conceptually possible for someone to watch this video and agree? Seemingly not, as the video is external and therefore forbidden, per its own definitions, from influence. What a weird and nonsensical stance that pervades his every argument. \n\n>[an individualist] should defend his reason and his will against [social constraints]. ...he will advance towards perfect indifference which is what wisdom is when confronting things that do not depend on him\n\nThis seems like a sudden shift in messaging. Previously the priority was achieving authenticity which ostensibly occurs at the rejection of influence... until the goal is pragmatism attained by apathy toward the unchangeable? Surely we recognize those are different? What is my authentic and uninfluenced disposition is to care about the unchangeable? \n\n>so Riner wants us to free ourselves from our emotional attachment regarding these social problems in the world\n\n...unless changing our view isn't possible of him, in which case he doesn't want to do it? Is this the inspiration for \"fox and the grapes\"?\n\n>our anger or sadness is not going to definitively change anything; the only practical result of our political involvement is our negative emotions\n\nFor me to explain why this is wrong would insult us both. Is society now identical to society at every prior point? No? What do you know: societal change is possible. \n\n>happiness of the people has no meaning; happiness is internal and individual\n\nAt what point do i accuse someone of speaking in bad faith? By this logic what are people, if persons are individual? What is an individual, if constituted of properties and substances? Is this a peak into a cohesive rejection of emergent phenomena... or an ad hoc argument shoehorned in? Also, in what way is consideration of a collective lazy compared to its neglect? Also, how lazy and pointless an ad homenim to say people advocating others \"don't even know\" the persons they advocate for. This is based on what?\n\n>does the wise man then have no pity for the oppressed? the wise man knows that the oppressed who complain aspire to be oppressors\n\nThat's a \"yes\". Lets assume, falsely, that this isn't projection; what would it matter to Ryner anyway? Is systemic oppression not both external and (purportedly) unchangeable? Surely Ryner isn't guilty of \"self inflicting wounds\"...\n\n>apoliticism doesn't equate to a total rejection of the troubles others face\n\nThe others just previously accused of being hopeful oppressors? Yeah I'm sure Ryner has great sympathy. ok.\n\n>the wise man knows that we can't destroy either social injustice... but he strives to save an oppressed person from a particular Injustice\n\nCan't destroy in entirety, or can't alter at all? The parallels to Ryner and the present american republican party are resounding. Same logic as \"the government can never absolutely eliminate all gun violence because some bad guy will always find a way to get a gun, therefore we should do nothing to reduce gun violence\". Why is there no acknowledgement that systemic approaches can be affective even if they can't be absolute in their impact? Is it because the immediate logical conclusion from that observation is a rejection of individualism, which then necessitates you help the oppressed that you ostensibly don't, but very clearly do, disdain? And this is your \"most agreeable quote\"? I think the rules forbid my next feedback so I'll leave it to your imagination what I think about you. \n\nAlso I am amazed how the societal problem of under-tipping servers is so clearly impacted by societal pressure to tip more that you feel the urge to include that pressure in your video, and in doing so abandoned the whole philosophy you're selling by forgetting that five minutes ago the essential teaching was established that these social pressures are incompatible with authentic individualism. \n\n...So the whole thing was ad hoc then. What was the point.",

Ryner believed that the true individualist lets their actions harmonize with their personal moral conscience. Although this sounds easy, social pressures and influences often override our authenticity and can make us act in ways we wouldn't normally act in. However, Ryner still believes sincerity to our true selves is a moral act worth pursuing. \n     With this in mind, it's easy to label him as an individualist. However, he advocates for indifference towards external things such as the world and society. Even blatantly calling anarchism a naivete, he wants us to instead focus on ourselves and what's in our immediate control rather than changing any large scale systems.",

The point of religion is (from a non-religious perspective) psychological. To create a sense of connection & meaning. To ward off existential anxiety. To give expression to that thing many of us feel deep inside: that we matter. That our choices matter. Our families matter. \n\nFurthermore, the article put me off right at the headline. There was never any “rise” in religion. Archaeology affirms there has been religion as long as there has been something that could reasonably be called human. \n\nSo, too, there will never be a “fall” of religion.

I miss the golden age of blogs and Im hopeful for your continued success.\n\nI have a few issues with pragmatism as the explanation for why religion persists. If religion existed because it told moral truths but those truths predate and exist independently of religion. If that's the case, why would religion be useful? We know not to kill, regardless of being told by a religion, so religion doesnt add any pragmatic value to ensuring society follows the proposition not to kill. And religion may be useful for broader social purposes, like building community (to put it nicely) or controlling people (to put it cynically), but I think we've seen plenty of pseudo-religious ideologies, like nationalism, have the same effect. So the explanation fails to account for why religion specifically was the mechanism to transmit these social or moral truths.\n\nI also would push back on the notion that most religion attempts to answer the big questions. Of course Christianity, Judaism, Islam etc. do try to account for cosmology and ethics, but a lot of animist and folk religions, which were the majority of religions through human history, treat the supernatural as just part of life and dont really look to that realm for guidance.\n\nUltimately give the diversity of religions and human reactions to them I think no one will find a single necessary and sufficient condition to account for the rise of religion, its persistence, and its downfall.",

But this is a very different notion. It is uncontroversial that what is rational or justified to believe changes over time in light of new evidence or theories. This doesn’t require that truth actually changes, only that we get closer to truth.\n\nAs a fellow pragmatism enjoyer, I’d recommend checking out C.S. Peirce and his commentators (Hookway, Misak, Haack, etc) on his theory of truth as “the end of inquiry.” Many pragmatists are drawn to William James’ “pragmatic theory of truth,” but Peirce’s theory is a lot less freewheeling and lot more philosophically defensible.",

Where we once had, \"If the answer to a question is unknown, it must be god\", this concept will gradually be replaced by, \"If the answer to a question is unknown, further research is needed to answer it.\"",

Social norms can and do evolve through criticism, dialogue, and experimentation—consider the abolition of slavery or the expansion of human rights. These are examples of error correction in moral philosophy, enabled by societies that tolerate and encourage dissent.\n\nOP asserts that truths depend on their usefulness to someone, but this neglects the objectivity of truth. Truth transcends immediate utility and personal perspective. A society thrives not by tailoring truths to what is useful for specific groups, but by fostering systems where errors—whether in social norms or physical theories—can be identified and corrected. This is the essence of a dynamic society, where ideas compete in an open marketplace and the best explanations prevail.\n\nThe post falls into the trap of conflating usefulness with validity, overlooking the role of error correction as the engine of progress. This easily leads to relativism, treating all subjectively \"pragmatic\" solutions as equal, regardless of how transient or superficial they are. Good explanations, by contrast, go beyond mere practicality.\n\nAn excellent video to explore some of these ideas: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x8-OYE5CRQ&t=588s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x8-OYE5CRQ&t=588s)\n\nAnd this one is fantastic as well, diving deeper into characteristics of good explanations: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63UNFIlrOIo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63UNFIlrOIo)",

Tylor's evolutionism, popularized by J. G. Frazer's *The Golden Bough*.  The assumption presented here - asserting that \"pre-science, religion was a useful source of answers in a world we really didn’t understand\" - doesn't seem that different from Tylor's, though this isn't a widely held position on the origin or nature of religion; there are far too many examples that don't fit and far too many explanations that better fit. Durkheim's functionalist approach isn't perfect, but he roots it in his theory of collective effervescence which completely sidesteps any attempts at \"religion as explanation\" and it seems resonate with more religious expressions than the rationalist approach.\n\nWittgenstein was criticizing Frazer and not Tylor directly, but his critique of Frazer's \"religion/magic as proto-science\" approach was devastating. Later Wittgensteinian philosopher of religion D. Z. Phillips points out more clearly that unlike the proto-scientist searching for explanations, no religious person is indifferent to their coming to \"believe in God\" - that's not how the word is used. \n\nI think this counterexample of a nonrational theory of religion explains why another premise of this argument is false - there is no fall of religion in need of explaining. The prevalence of religion - as well as its definition - waxes and wanes at different points in history. On another note, I question the utility in making a firm distinction between religion and culture itself.\n\n\n\n*“Religion didn’t create and uphold our social values; rather the values predated the religion, which acted as a container for them.”*\n\nA) Religion isn't a thing capable of creating anything. It is itself a creation, possibly a mode of creating discourse rather than something apart from culture.\n\nB) If there were values that \"predated religion\", that doesn't mean we are the inheritors of those particular values. Values are going to reflect the culture in which they are meant to function, constantly changing and being renegotiated, so I don't think it makes sense to say values predated the religion as if that explains something. We've \"been religious\" since the time we shared the land with the Neanderthals, but I can't think of some value from that epoch that predated religion and still remains relevant to humans today.

Either of those things require moral judgement on what is a good person. Traditionally, the study of mental health sought to skirt these problems by adopting the approach of physical health. They attempted to restore the capabilities that a \"normative\" person has. However, this approach has been cracking at the seams for a long time. We have positive psychology, which attempts to improve even normative people. Seeking self-improvement and improvement in other people requires us to make moral judgements about how we *should* be. There's also a bunch of mental health conditions that stretch the traditional definition, or where returning somebody to normative might not actually be helpful. Neurodiversity challenges the notion that for some disorders, we must return people to being normative. The ubiquity of ADHD diagnoses, and the varying severities which it has, challenge the notion that there is a clearly defined norm, which encompasses a large majority of people. Trans issues are also a big challenge in many ways.\n\nPsychologists need to become more knowledgeable in ethics and more comfortable talking about it if we are to solve these challenges.",

I used Freud’s essay on the Uncanny for a paper on Stairs in the Woods.\n\nIn psychology today, the only cache they have is in PsyDs and PsyD programs that specifically teach depth psychology for therapeutic purposes.

I am going somewhere with it.\n\nCounter to the rhetoric online of insufferable \"intro philosophy or anthropology students\", I think the people that really need to hear this messaging most are the people who *haven't* taken those classes, because in my experience professors do a tremendous job of contextualizing what is actually meant by ideas like \"racism is prejudice + power\". The worst versions of these arguments get repeated by people who either don't have that context, or haven't taken the time to really understand. \n\nThere's the dictionary, then there are colloquialisms, and then there are *field specific* definitions of words. The exact same word, used in completely different ways, in completely different contexts. \n\nDifferent academic fields do this all the time. For example: Freud used the term \"Sublimation\" to refer to when socially unacceptable impulses, desires, or urges are transformed into socially acceptable actions. Geology/chemistry use the term \"Sublimation\" to refer to the process by which a substance transitions directly from a solid state to a gaseous state without passing through the liquid phase. Philosophy uses the term \"Sublimation\" to refer to a metaphorical process of elevating instinctual or primal energies into cultural, intellectual, or spiritual achievements.\n\nSo first, this is part of why being an expert in one field does not make you an expert in every other field of academics. You might know the scientific method, but you've only learned the language of your own field. It is *literally* like learning another language. Different words are used in different fields to refer to the same phenomena, aspects of your work, equipment, methods, etc., and the same words can be used across disciplines to refer to wildly different concepts.\n\nFor example: Anthropology, as a field, was not trying to say that \"people can't be racist\". They were simply saying that, when we talk about racism *in anthropology*, the word is used to refer to a broader concept of structural inequality (prejudice + power). Individuals can still be racist. Anthropology studies structures and societies, not individuals.\n\nMore directly related to OP's mention of the misapplication of the idea of power: It's the same blind, rigid, contextless application of an idea that no one with real academic qualifications would ever advocate for, because they've spent time gaining context and learning the language.\n\nWe have to remember that when we see an idea repeated online, we are 9 times out of 10 seeing the least subtle and most rigid and thoughtlessly applied version of it, by people who are emotionally incensed and not prepared with the context and rigor of academics.\n\n*ANY* moral system taken to such an extreme and applied so rigidly will fail to stand up to scruntiny. This is an ongoing sociological problem right now, across really all domains. When everyone is polarized, every idea becomes valuable as a tool to serve their purpose, rather than something valuable unto itself.",

Who actually makes this argument? I don't know, the article doesn't say—it's just the ominous “*They.*” The author brings up Marx and Foucault while never actually quoting them; which is not surprising, because if they had been intellectually responsible and had bothered to learn anything about Marx, they would know that dividing the world between a group of oppressor and a group of oppressee would be laughably reductive of Marxian theory. Likewise, while never outright ascribing any normative position to Foucault, the author mentions him and a few short lines later brings up how postmodern academics supposedly view all power relations as oppressive—leaving it to the reader to make the association with Foucault. But does Foucault think all power relations are oppressive? How about we *actually* quote the man himself?\n\n\"But it seems to me now that the notion of repression is quite inadequate for capturing what is precisely the productive aspect of power. In defining the effects of power as repression, one adopts a purely juridical conception of such power; one identifies power with a law which says no; power is taken above all as carrying the force of a prohibition. **Now I believe that this is a wholly negative, narrow, skeletal conception of power, one which has been curiously widespread. If power were never anything but repressive, if it never did anything but to say no, do you really think one would be brought to obey it? What makes power hold good, what makes it accepted, is simply the fact that it doesn't only weigh on us as a force that says no, but that it traverses and produces things, it induces pleasure, forms knowledge, produces discourse. It needs to be considered as a productive network which runs through the whole social body much more than as a negative instance whose function is repression.**\"\n\n- from *Power/Knowledge*\n\nIt's easy to sound smart by debating bogeymen and strawmen. It's the favorite tactic of online “intellectuals” and reactionaries. This type of content is not looking to challenge its readers, to offer unique insight, or to engage with philosophy and theory in a serious and intellectually responsible way.

It highlights how governments and corporations exploit this interconnectedness to control, surveil, and manipulate populations.

        "body": "You make a compelling case about the limits of argumentation, and while I get where you're coming from, I think you might be overstating things. The idea that arguments can _only_ convince us of things we’re already implicitly committed to sells human reasoning short. If that were true, then meaningful change through dialogue would be nearly impossible—and that just doesn’t track with reality. People _do_ change their minds through arguments, sometimes in profound ways, and it’s not always because they discover an inconsistency in their own beliefs.\n\nFor one, focusing too heavily on logical consistency can miss the messiness of how people actually form and revise their beliefs. Sure, deductive arguments rely on premises being consistent, but most people don’t walk around with a perfectly coherent web of credences. We’re not robots. We hold contradictory beliefs all the time, often without realizing it. And that doesn’t mean we’re irrational—it means we’re human. Sometimes, being convinced by an argument doesn’t come from spotting an inconsistency; it comes from seeing an issue framed in a way we hadn’t considered before.\n\nPlus, the idea that rational persuasion can only succeed when our beliefs are internally inconsistent assumes too much about how tightly people cling to their frameworks. In reality, people’s beliefs are often more fluid. We’re influenced by stories, analogies, experiences, and values—not just cold logic. As some of the replies in that thread pointed out, persuasion often works through reframing or offering a new perspective, not just pointing out contradictions. A good argument can plant a seed that grows over time, even if someone isn’t ready to accept it immediately. The person who talked about overcoming addiction after being confronted with rational arguments is a perfect example. At the time, they weren’t implicitly committed to changing their life, but the arguments eventually broke through.\n\nRegarding values, you're right that a lot of arguments boil down to differing values, and if two people’s core values are wildly different, finding common ground is tough. But that doesn’t mean it’s _impossible_. Values aren’t set in stone. People can and do revise what they care about, often through discussion. The assumption that if Person A values X and Person B values Y, they’ll never agree misses the potential for dialogue to _reshape_ those values. Sometimes, an argument isn’t about convincing someone to change their conclusion but about getting them to reconsider what they value in the first place.\n\nAnother thing worth pushing back on is the idea that rational persuasion is doomed if people have different starting points. This assumes that all disagreements are about airtight webs of belief clashing, but most of the time, it’s not that clean. Our beliefs are shaped by social contexts, personal experiences, and who we trust. As someone in this thread noted, a lot of persuasion depends on _trusting the person making the argument_. If you think someone is biased or acting in bad faith, their argument won’t land, no matter how logical it is. But if you build trust and show empathy, you can open someone up to ideas they weren’t previously on board with.\n\nAnd let’s not forget that arguments are rarely isolated syllogisms. They’re part of a broader dialogue where people clarify their views, ask questions, and adjust their thinking. This back-and-forth can lead to genuine shifts in perspective, even if it doesn’t resolve into perfect agreement. Graham Oppy’s idea about laying out your worldview and assessing its overall strengths hits on this. Sometimes, progress isn’t about “winning” an argument but about showing someone that your framework has explanatory power or coherence in a way they hadn’t seen before.\n\nThe notion that rational persuasion is only possible when our beliefs are inconsistent also underestimates the role of _new evidence_ and _new interpretations_. People change their minds not just because they spot contradictions but because they encounter new information or see old information in a new light. It’s not always about discovering flaws; sometimes, it’s about expanding what we consider plausible or worth caring about. If someone believes that people are fundamentally selfish, and you show them compelling evidence of altruism, that can nudge them toward a different view—not by exposing an inconsistency, but by broadening their understanding of human nature.\n\nThere are limits to argumentation—especially when core values clash—I don’t think those limits are as rigid as you suggest. Humans are more adaptable than your thesis implies. We’re capable of changing our minds through dialogue, reframing, and trust-building, not just through spotting contradictions.\n\nIf rational persuasion were as narrow as you describe, we’d all be locked into our starting beliefs forever. Thankfully, that’s not the case. Dialogue still matters, and the effort to understand and be understood can lead to real, meaningful change—even if it doesn’t happen on the spot.\n\nHaving said all that, it's refreshing to even be able to discuss such things in a forum. It isn't about right or wrong here, just feeling out the borders of the canvas of discussion and enjoying the exploration, so thank you.",

I was raised by very good people and had excellent role models growing up, for instance. I can say \"I believe people are basically good\", because that's my experience, it's what I was taught, and it's a perspective that has served me well through my 60 years.\n\nOf course, it might not be true. It's probably not the sort of thing that could be proven, but if it could and if reality were proven to be opposite that would be difficult. I don't want to change my position, so I'd probably come to some cordial internal arrangement where I'd stand over here, and reality would have to mind its business over there, and that's how it would stay.\n\nThere are a lot of people who have a very basic belief that people are *not* good, which may well come from their own experiences and be non-negotiable parts of their identity. That leads to political viewpoints that differ significantly from mine, and it leads to a lot of behavioral differences as well. Which I see as dysfunctional, but might well be based on reality regardless. There's not much I can do about it.\n\nAnyway, that would be the example I think of to understand how people can turn away from rational arguments and ignore something that's obviously true. It applies best to philosophical arguments, of course, whereas other things (like flat earth theory and so forth) are entirely different. The problem with those is that people don't necessarily *care* about what is real or not, or value types of social interaction as much more important. Not everyone has a solid concept of \"external reality\".",

There _is_ a single truth - including many personalized \"should\"-statements, if you grant a few axioms - and most people would want to converge to it. But it's also almost certain that people's ultimate post-lots-of-reflection preferences still differ and conflict with each other, and not just in the boring zero-sum way (10 people, 8 ice-creams, everyone wants one), nor just personality and taste (I want privacy, you don't / chocolate vs. vanilla), but in other interesting recursive ways (I want everyone to have privacy, you want everyone to not have it). That, however, doesn't mean they should rationally disagree about reality; they should rationally hide information from each other, but that's different.\n\nOne idea you seem to be missing about convincingness is the very important node(s) in the web containing all propositions akin to \"what does the other guy know, what is he trying to do, is he honest, is he biased, is he trying to fool me\" and so on. A lot of the time convincing people is less like \"you saw a red ball, therefore you'll also see a green ball, and here are the reasons to believe this\" and more like \"I told you if red then green, therefore if red then green, and here are the reasons to believe this\", a meta-layer higher. The logical structure of the base argument can be irrelevant, and instead what matters is the (recursive models of) behavior, beliefs, preferences etc. of you and your interlocutor. It can be rational to ignore someone, it can be rational to believe them, it can be rational to believe them even as you know they're lying k% of the time, it depends mostly on what you think about each other. Look up Bayesian persuasion.\n\nAnother idea is that this kind of logical deductive argument is most of the time not complete. It only works within a context, it ignores information and forces reality into a few propositions, and this \"forcing\" is where you hide any problems, not the logic. Consider what the most common response to such arguments is - not that the logic is bad or a straightforward rejection of one premise, but something like \"it's not that simple\". You can perfectly well reconcile \"theft is bad\" and \"taxes are theft\" and \"taxes are good\" if you're careful about what general statements like those mean - they're obviously not always-true but they're also not meant to be true \"on average\" or \"most of the time\", they're something more complicated (see e.g. [here](https://www.problang.org/chapters/07-generics.html)).",

        "body": "The problem is that, fundamentally, asking for forgiveness and being forgiven are very different things.\n\nTake, as an example, you punching me because we were drunk and fighting.  But we are friends, and it's all in good fun.  The next day, you apologize, I accept your forgiveness.  There we go, all good.\n\nBut, to use the same example of a punch, and the same qualification that you are drunk, this time I'm your spouse.  And you are always drunk, and always hitting me.  Then you say you are sorry and ask for forgiveness.  Why should I believe you this time?  Why should I assume you are actually sorry, and not desperately just trying to keep me from leaving?\n\nIf you want to ask for forgiveness, go wild.  But the fact of you asking forgiveness does not mean I must accept it.  I might, if I think you are genuinely sorry, trying to do better and the harm has been rectified.  But I shouldn't have to, just because a piece of shit invoked god and made a statement that comes down to 'I know I'm not perfect, but I'm trying, and that's good enough for god.'  If asking for forgiveness must be met with an affirmative, then it is less a request than a demand.  And how dare you demand that of me, and of the people you have hurt?\n\nWhat this really comes down to are the ways conservatives and progressives view power.  As an example, let's look at two people accused of...less than stellar conduct, Clarence Thomas and Al Franken.  Thomas used the conservative playbook, denying and defaming.  And conservatives may not have liked it, but key members of the movement judged that having that person in that position was valuable enough that they would fight the charges.  Franken had a much different response.  Those accusations were a risk to his career, and a weapon that could- and would- be deployed against him any time he spoke on women's issues, regardless if they were true or not.  Many in his base lost their faith with him as his advocate.  The principle was seen as more valuable than his position, so he stepped down.  This lead to a power vacuum, and had the potential to loose the democrats votes.\n\nSo when someone on the right does something really bad, something that they can't 'it wasn't me!' out of, they apologize, and use that alleged contrition to hold onto power.  And yeah, pundits that agree with them attack anyone who doesn't accept the apology, because they know accusing their rivals with being inhuman is a good way to shift the blame away from the people in the story that did something super wrong.  But I don't know.  I think standing up and saying, 'that guy had copies of a lot of CP.  Like a lot.  A disturbing amount.  Maybe giving him a hug and telling him it's okay isn't something I care to do right now' is a reasonable thing to do.  Maybe it's worth it, in those moments, to come correct with all the times those same pundits have demonized people for shoplifting or loitering.  Maybe it's okay to say, 'I'm not forgiving shit until there has been something tangible backing up this statement'.  Or 'these fuckers lie all the time, and since we now know they are also a pedophile, I can doubly tell them to fuck off.'\n\nBut nobody wants to do that, because all their bosses are out there partying with Diddy and know they are one bad day away from being in the same goddamn boat, and when that push comes to shove they would really like if everyone just forgave them and moved on.  After all, that's just the way of the world, right?",

The forgiveness of the powerless person that the abused is meaningless to them because they don't fear them for revenge.",

He was concerned with what it means to be, specifically, he was responding to idealists who thought the context of the material world existed within the mind. For Descartes, to think is sufficient to be. However, for Gasset, you need to be in the world to be. The world provides us with things to think about and experience. We have a codependent relationship with the world where it doesn't exist without us and we don't exist without it.",

Or does it simply mean that the thoughts would be completely different and unrecognizable to our \"now-minds\"? \n\nWould we still consider an unrecognizable thought pattern as \"thought\"? If the answer is \"yes\", we would still have to consider that Descartes's statement holds up as fact. If the answer is \"no\", then we would have to consider that Jose Ortega y Gassett's statements hold as fact. Or do we?\n\nVery interesting!! Thank you for the share!!",

If every particle and quantized energy in the universe was recorded at a certain time, given enough processing power, the trajectory from that point on could be calculated.\n\n2. Since humans follow the laws of the universe, their behavior could also be predicted.\n\n3. This would mean every action and scenario in the future would be predetermined.\n\nAs a human being with consciousness the thought of a predetermined future makes free will seem to not exist.\n\nThinking more into human choice making, humans are almost always inaccurate in predicting the future either due to lack of information or bias in calculation. This may create a feeling of randomness in the universe, making it seem like the future is not predetermined and implying that the actions and choices we make can change what is to come.\n\nThus, is our ability to ignorantly make predictions about the future (whether it be from bias in processing or lack of information) what makes us human? This might explain why computers, designed to make unbiased predictions from real data, seem to have no consciousness.\n\nTo me this seems like us humans beings should embrace our inherently inaccurate predictions and thoughts as what makes us “conscious”.",

Recently, someone suggested a more holistic approach to these ideas, and their feedback really resonated with me, inspiring me to broaden my perspective.\n\nHere’s the refined concept:\n\n1. Faith as a Shared Transmission Through Family\n\nOriginally, I framed faith transmission as a “father-to-son” inheritance, symbolizing a lineage of spiritual wisdom passed through generations. However, I now see the value in adopting a more holistic view—one that incorporates the shared roles of both parents.\n\nFaith isn’t just passed through words or teachings but through actions, rituals, and a shared commitment to spiritual life. This includes traditions like the Sacrament of Baptism, which bridges the spiritual and tangible by embodying theological teachings in a lived practice. Together, parents symbolize the fullness of divine love, offering children a comprehensive view of faith that is both nurturing and guiding.\n\n2. Sexual Intercourse as a Sacred Act of Creation\n\nI continue to see human intimacy as more than just a biological act—it is a reflection of divine love and the unity between Creator and creation. Sexuality holds spiritual significance as a means of participating in the divine narrative of creation, mirroring the interconnectedness of love, life, and purpose.\n\nThrough this lens, human relationships, particularly familial ones, become a microcosm of the divine—where love and creation are intertwined in a sacred dance that echoes God’s creative work.\n\n3. Symbolism in Religious Texts and Rituals\n\nReligious symbols often point to deeper spiritual truths, particularly those tied to family and creation. I see procreation, family dynamics, and the act of nurturing as metaphors for larger divine purposes. For example, the role of parents in guiding their children mirrors God’s care for humanity.\n\nParticipating in religious traditions and rituals provides a tangible way to connect with these spiritual truths. The Sacrament of Baptism, for instance, symbolizes rebirth and divine grace, grounding abstract theological concepts in lived experience.\n\n4. Bridging the Spiritual and Physical\n\nAt its heart, this concept explores how our earthly experiences—love, intimacy, family, and tradition—reflect larger spiritual truths. By uniting the physical and spiritual realms, we see how human relationships and religious practices are intertwined, offering a fuller understanding of divine love and creation.\n\nQuestions for the Community\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts on these ideas:\n\nHow do you see the roles of both parents in transmitting faith? Do you believe there’s a balance between maternal and paternal contributions that reflects divine love?\n\nDo you think sexuality as a sacred act of creation is underexplored in religious teachings?\n\nHow do rituals like Baptism or other family-oriented religious practices help bridge the gap between spiritual and physical realms?\n\n\nI’m excited to hear your feedback, insights, or critiques. Let’s dive into a thoughtful discussion about the interplay of faith, family, and creation.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, and I look forward to exploring these ideas together!",

        "body": "Was talking with someone about the corpus of sage advice and human knowledge, inherited from generations before. We disagreed on this point:\n\nJust because an idea existed for thousands of years doesn't mean that it is impervious to being forgotten, or becoming impractical in a future context. An idea that we hold to be sacred might actually be unfit for our current context as well. That was my stance, she begged to differ.\n\nIn reading anthropology and history, I can think of many ideas that died or changed in character through the eons, yet had hundreds, if not thousands of years of backing before they died/changed. \n\n\\- The mythology of Egypt and the Pharaoh's divinity may have had primacy in Egyptian society for 2000+ years, but that didn't stop it from eventually being fused with or supplanted by Hellenistic, Coptic Christian, and later Islamic religion. What they would have considered as sage advice in 500 BCE Egypt because it had 2000+ years backing is now inapplicable, or at least foreign to what we engage with today.\n\n\\- Even the divine right of kings. We have so many secular, constitutional societies today where politicians and people are limited in the type of power they have compared to kings, because constitutional republics upended a 2000+ year old tradition of theological monarchy by outcompeting those societies.\n\n\\- What about the Greek Four Humors? Developed by Hippocrates, it was considered sage advice for a while to bring a patient to health by restoring the balance of Blood, Phlegm, Black Bile, and Yellow Bile in the human body. After 2000 years of bloodletting and similar practices that were at best placebo, it died in the face of enlightenment and industrial medical advances. \n\nThe Internet is a meat grinder for traditions and human knowledge, and I feel as if many of the things inherited from the past have been rearranged, taken out of context, killed, revitalized, and mixed together to form the information soup we all swim through nowadays. In this context, what ideas will prove to survive and best serve the human soul in the future?\n\nPerhaps universal human truths. Birth, death. Cooperation, malice. Pleasure, pain. Self interest, self sacrifice. Spiritual reality, material reality. Warfare, peace. Love, hate. How much more fundamental can someone get than that? Could they be the common thread of all these ideas, where ideas shed and trim their fat, but these core truths will remain to be passed on and reinterpreted for future generations?\n\nIdk if this makes sense for the main post board. That's why I am posting it here.",

        "body": "This video essay examines the existential themes of isolation and home in *Super Mario Galaxy*, drawing a parallel to *The Little Prince*. Both Mario and the Little Prince travel through space, encountering strange worlds and new relationships, yet their reasons for leaving their homes are starkly different. The Little Prince chooses his journey, while Mario is thrust into it by loss—his quest to rescue Princess Peach spiraling into a larger cosmic struggle that forces him into an endless search. The essay connects this to existentialism, particularly the sense of being trapped in a \"no exit\" scenario: Mario’s journey is infinite, without the finality or closure that might bring peace, unlike the Prince's voluntary departure. The narrative of Rosalina, too, highlights themes of loss and adaptation, as she finds a new sense of home among the stars after the death of her parents. In this light, *Super Mario Galaxy* becomes a subtle exploration of how, when all is lost, the stars can become both a symbol of infinite isolation and, paradoxically, of a new home. The essay argues that the game’s existential undercurrents—masked beneath its playful design—suggest that, in the face of overwhelming isolation, we must make peace with the void and find meaning in it.",

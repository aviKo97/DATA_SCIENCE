Paying this $29 fee allows the person to keep building their credit if they get stuck in a shit month.\n\nI don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any way to leverage this $29 waiver to your advantage, but it‚Äôs cool to have as a just in case type of thing",

No. \n\nDoes shit happen and it‚Äôs probably an ok idea in rare circumstances? Yes. \n\nShould you skip for something that is a WANT and not a NEED? NO. \n\nBut most wealthy people don‚Äôt get it.

I'm other words, if you charge jobs, you can't take it with you and you need to start over again. \n\nOutside of work you can buy whole life, term, universal, hybrids and derivatives of all the above to meet your needs. \n\nWhich brings us to the next point others have raised.  Life insurance protects others (the beneficiary) in case something happens to you. It could be a business partner, family, etc.  If you have nothing that you want protected, take whatever is free from your employer and nothing else.\n\nWhen you get married and have kids, get term and invest the rest.

        "body": " I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this ‚Äî both the health stuff and the wealth manager nightmare. You‚Äôre absolutely not alone. A lot of folks hand over money to ‚Äúbig name‚Äù firms thinking they‚Äôll be in good hands, and then realize years later that they‚Äôve just paid a premium for underperformance and jargon.\n\nLet me try to address some of your questions:\n\n‚∏ª\n\n> How does one unwind a position with a wealth manager?\n\nIt‚Äôs usually easier than it feels emotionally. Start by setting up new accounts at a custodian you trust ‚Äî Vanguard, Fidelity, Schwab are the big 3 DIY-friendly options.\n\nOnce your new account is open, you initiate an ACATS transfer (Automated Customer Account Transfer Service). It can be in-kind, meaning you move your existing holdings as-is ‚Äî no selling involved, so no capital gains triggered. Just be careful with any proprietary funds (some big firms use these), which may not be transferable and would need to be liquidated.\n\nOnce the assets land at your new custodian, you can decide what to keep, sell, or reallocate.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n> Can I move the 529s to low-cost providers and use target date funds?\n\nYes, absolutely. Most states let you roll 529 plans to another provider once per 12 months per beneficiary. Vanguard, Utah‚Äôs My529, and NY‚Äôs 529 plan are all great low-cost options. Just check your current plan‚Äôs details ‚Äî some states give tax deductions for contributions that may be clawed back if you move the funds too soon.\n\nTarget enrollment funds for 529s are a totally valid ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù option.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n> IRA with $900K ‚Äì can I move this and go with a target date fund?\n\n100% yes. You can do a trustee-to-trustee transfer of the IRA (no tax implications), then invest it however you want. A target date fund at Fidelity, Schwab, or Vanguard is perfectly reasonable if you want something simple, diversified, and low maintenance.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n> What about the $2M in mixed assets (cash equivalents, private equity, stocks/bonds)?\n\nThis is the trickiest part. The liquid assets (cash, stocks, bonds) can probably be transferred in-kind with little issue. If there are significant unrealized gains, be strategic about what you sell and when, especially in taxable accounts.\n\nFor the PE-style stuff: unfortunately, you may be stuck with those until they hit their liquidation timelines. You can still transfer ownership, but some alt investments aren‚Äôt ACATS-eligible and may require additional paperwork or even approval from the issuer. Your new advisor or custodian can help with that process.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n> Should I let the new advisor manage everything or keep some accounts DIY?\n\nTotally up to you. Many people do a hybrid ‚Äî for example, hire a flat-fee planner for the complex stuff (like the $2M), and DIY the IRAs and 529s with simple, passive strategies.\n\nBut if you‚Äôre dealing with a serious health issue and just don‚Äôt want the stress, it‚Äôs valid to hand more over ‚Äî just be sure the advisor you hire is truly fiduciary, transparent, and earns their fee.\n\nAsk for a sample investment plan or portfolio. See how they communicate. If they speak in clear language and can justify their choices without BS, that‚Äôs a good sign.\n\nLet us know how it goes üôå",

I just could not imagine being retired and paying our financial advisor so many dollars per year. We left a taxable investment account with ML but just this week took that over to fidelity. Once you have decided to move your accounts it‚Äôs actually very easy to actually get them transferred. Fidelity/vanguard can help you find the right form but it can all be done on line, including the signatures. You have done the hardest part and that is making the decisions. If you need to open new accounts at fidelity/vanguard just make sure the names on the new accounts exactly match the current ones also do this with the 529s.

And I was a bit surprised at how small the profit margin is on insurance (googling returned a range of 2-5% being most common).\n\nIf an insurance company thinks/sees that payouts are going up, or their overhead gets more expensive, then they'll raise prices.  Home values / rebuild costs are part of that payout calculation.  Along with risk assessment for \"chances home X will encounter event Y costing $Z to pay for\".  If things like damaging weather events get more common, like those tornadoes that passed through St. Paul a few weeks back, their predicted payout numbers go up which again means they have to raise prices.\n\nClaim predictions tend to be more accurate with a larger customer base; look up the \"law of large numbers\" for context.  So if a given company has started losing a significant number of customers, they need to have a bigger reserve buffer (aka collect more in premiums) to hedge against higher uncertainty.\n\nTL/DR: the home insurance market is getting pricier for a lot of people.  You can try to mitigate your particular situation by shopping around for another provider, adjust your coverage down (within required guidelines set by law/mortgage), maybe go with a higher deductible, check whether the policy's \"replacement value\" is in line with the actual value of the home, etc.",

I lived and breathed Army.  I served at the highest levels and was rewarded handsomely.

I was on active duty for 15% of the Army's total existence on the day I retired.  \n\nThe day after I retired no one cared. The Army went rolling along.\n\nAnd guess what, its worse in \"regular\" jobs.  The Army is still paying me (retirement) and taking care of me (medical).  Unless you happen to have an amazing employer, they wont give a crap about you the day after you leave.  The company I work for now just got bought out by private equity.  That caused people at corporate to become \"redundant.\"  One dude who had been with the company for almost 20 years and was largely responsible for coordinating the buyout got pushed out less than a week later.  Sure they wrote him a big check but they also escorted him to the door.

Now some of that was hard living.  War messes with you.  But for a lot of those guys work was their life and when work went away, so did their desire to live.  Dont be like that.

Had I waited another 6 months she would not have been able to answer the questions they asked her to ensure I was who I said I was.  \n\n- get control of her phone.  I switched my mom to a VOIP \"land line\" for a bunch of reasons but the biggest was so I could monitor her received calls from across the country.  And the account was in my name so the company had to deal with me.  That was actually the phone companies suggestion.  I could call them and say \"block this number\" and it got done.  Worth every dime of the $60 a month I paid.  \n\n- Set the 2FA to YOUR device/email.\n\n- Because I was ON the account with the bank it was easy to get notified of any unusual transactions.  My mom used a very local bank for over 30 years so we went over what her normal transactions were and what was going to change as she transitioned to assisted living.  Basically if any money came out any time outside of the first 5 days of the month they were going to call me.  Same with any transaction over $xx that wasnt the living facility.",

But, and this is not for a very small percentage of folks, if you will have a retirement income higher than your I come today, then Roth may be better overall. The way this usually happens is you save enough for retirement, let‚Äôs say $2-3M, but then keep working another 10+ years. If that is your plan, I say bias the 401K to more Roth. If you feel you will retire when you have ‚Äúenough‚Äù, then Traditional 401K is the answer.",

I start with an emergency fund of six months (at least) of expenses. If your expenses are low, as mine are, you might need a little more. My wife and I plan on retiring at 50, which requires a more aggressive investment contribution, but you should generally be investing at least 15% of gross income to tax-advantaged retirement accounts.\n\nThen comes short- to medium-term goals. When I buy a car, I expect I'll have to replace it one day - let's say I expect my car to last ten years and I want to replace it for $30k, that's a $250 payment to savings. If your car lasts beyond that, you can just let it ride in HYSA to keep up with inflation if you like the car enough to keep driving it (I've been driving the same 2003 Honda for 22 years). If I want to take a $10k trip to Italy in 12 months, that becomes a line item. If I want a $25k wedding in two years, that's a line item.\n\nAfter accounting for all of your goals, whatever remains is yours to spend guilt-free. If you don't like how much you have leftover, you have to adjust your other goals. If you have too much, figure out if you'd like to invest more, travel more, buy a nicer car, whatever.\n\nMy wife and I don't take out debt for anything. We rented for seventeen years before buying our house in cash out of our investments. I don't think folks have to go debt-free for a house, but I'd stop thinking in terms of debt for things like cars, weddings, vacations. Save cash. If you aren't able or aren't willing to save up the requisite amount of cash, set it on the floor, and figuratively light it on fire, then it's too much or too soon for your financial world. If you are willing to do that, buy whatever the heck you want - cars, vacations, Pok√©mon cards.",

If I'm doing the math right, you are saving about 10% for retirement. My goal has been above 15% plus whatever the employer does.  Once you get to your wedding goal, I'd recommend upping that  401k and challenge yourself to get to Max contributions. Not saying it has to be this year. It took me 5 years to get there by taking every raise I got and increasing my 401k by that exact %. Trust me when I say it's a lot easier to do this than plan catch up years later. You can't miss money you never had. \n\nI also prefer to only keep 2 months expenses in my checking. Will this make you rich, no not really. I just find checking provide almost no return and seeing my checking balance being high/accessable tends to drive more frivolous spending. I find having money in a HYSA at a different bank helps control that impulse. \n\nLastly, are you talking to your partner on their goals and numbers? You may find that looking at the two of you as one will change your decisions. Example, my wife was not saving more than the match and we worked to build budgets to get to a goal we agreed on. \n\nGood luck!",

Get a good nights sleep if you have been neglecting that. Now, look at the bright side. you have a good paying job. If you are not in your apprenticeship program, does that mean that your job is at stake? If so, that should be your first call, to the union.  set up a payment plan, or at least find out if you have been irrevocably fired so that you can move on.\n\nDoes your lover also have a job? That should be tandem-step one, assuming you two are planning on staying together and she shares your goal of stability and prosperity. If she worked part time at a grocery store, she may get a discount on food. If she works in an office, she may get free health insurance. Think like that when looking at job listings for her. Apply the same logic to you, if you need a new job. You are staying full time at an airbnb, does the owner have other units that you could clean or maintain for lower rent?\n\nPlease don't take offense, but from your post, I am guessing that maybe you grew up with money but neglected on a human level. You are staying in an airbnb while deep in debt, that is a very bougie option. You bought a new car two years ago and ran it into the ground. It is nothing to be ashamed of. If you did not receive financial guidance, of course you will be behind your peers. Do not be ashamed, but don't hide from the pain of all this. This can either be the most stressful time of your life, and from it you learn and grow--- or you could be at step one of a toxic pattern that follows you forever. The difference is SO simple-- can you FACE this and take tiny steps every day to change it? \n\nDay one: make a list. It will be SO uncomfortable to list all the things you've been neglecting, and you will be exhausted afterward. Have some ice cream. \n\nDay two: organize the list between urgent and non urgent, and important and less-important. Do a few tasks, and find the paperwork/phone-numbers/whatever for a few others. \n\nYou really truly can do this. Every time you give up and wallow in it, you are just putting off something that will **never bother you again**\n\nOnce you understand this stuff and it's all on a schedule, it will pracically disappear. it will become no harder than showering. It is only your hesitation and the accumulation that is so bad. Trust me, a million young people have been in your shoes, and it becomes a charming story in 40 years. You are going to be fine.",

Instead of giving your brother a free out and paying it off which he will likely eventually be back in. Offer to do an interest free loan to him. This will force him to have accountability and still be on the hook for his mistakes but not actually be drowning in that debt. \n\n\nA good part about this is it will force him to make ends meet with the budget he has. After a while he might find that he doesn‚Äôt need as much as he has been spending so once he pays you back, he can start putting that payment to you towards a positive account like a Roth IRA or a high yields savings. \n\n\nIf you want to at a later date forgive the rest of the loan because he has proven to be more responsible then you can do that. \n\n\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n\n\nThis worked for me and saved me from making the same mistakes. My original debt including credit cards, school loans, plus car loan was 42k at 23 years old. Fortunately my parents helped and I paid $1100/month for over 3 years at which point my family forgave the loan because they trusted me. I‚Äôm now 30 nearing 6 figures in investment accounts and own my own home with about 60k in equity, and own two cars. All because that loan, without the interest, forced me to live within my means and not let my parents down.\n\n\nEdit: also like to add, I had signed an agreement that had a witness. Basically trying to make it legal liable for the debt as possible without get a lawyer to draw up a document. There were rules such as how I could spend, whether I could take vacations, collateral (my car), and late payment fees and a 2 week requirement to pay off the entire outstanding debt if I missed a payment.",

Obviously more of this work exists in a city than a small town.

I would be very wary of doing this for anything other than the minimum money you *need*.\n\nYes a HELOC carries a lower interest rate than a credit card. However, if you don‚Äôt pay the HELOC *you lose your house.* So it‚Äôs a dangerous idea to transform your unsecured debt (credit card, they can‚Äôt take anything) into secured debt (HELOC, they can take your home). \n\nWhat‚Äôs your plan for paying off the HELOC? If you can‚Äôt afford $300 a month extra for your new insurance policy, how are you going to pay off this new loan? You‚Äôve had credit card debt since college and you haven‚Äôt been able to pay it off yet. This is not to shame you. There is no shame here. It‚Äôs just laying out the math. \n\nThe HELOC seems like an exciting opportunity to you to restart. Put your past behind you, consolidate it into one loan, turn over a new leaf. But that emotional/psychological impulse is risking your home. \n\nIf I were you, I would take it one step at a time. No expensive metal roof. No deck. No extra HELOC loan to pay credit card debt.\n\nDo the math on what a cheap traditional roof would cost you (dollar amount, forget about the interest rate for now). Then do the math on what your new insurance policy costs you. Does it make sense to get a HELOC to pay for a new roof, or could you pay the extra premium while you save for a new roof? Or could you get new quotes from other insurance companies? They might not require you to fix your roof. \n\nIf you are serious about paying off the credit card debt, I would see about getting a new credit card with a 12-18 month 0% APR offer with balance transfers. The idea is that you transfer your existing credit card debt onto a new credit card, and have 12-18 months to pay it off interest free before the usual interest rate starts up again. There is usually a a fee, a few hundred dollars, and it‚Äôs tacked onto the credit card balance.",

The latter is not suing and it is a common tactic where they expect debtors to see a letter from a law firm and think they're going to prison. If the former, then fine you'll have to engage an attorney, but if the latter then I wouldn't give it much thought.\n\nRegarding your credit - if it's showing on your credit report then the damage has already been done and it is not coming off for 7 years. The only exception would be if you form an agreement with the debt collector that they remove it from your credit report once paid, and I've yet to find any debt collector that will do that or know how. If there is no such option then my advice would be to not pay it because it will not accomplish anything. If you wish to pay it because it is the right thing to do then god bless you go do as you wish, but aside from that there is nothing more you'll receive then self-satisfaction. Unfortunately even if you pay it's not common for these collection accounts to be marked as unsatisfied. The debt collector will take your money and then sell the account off to another collector and the cycle will repeat with each debt collector hoping they can just scare you into paying even if you have nothing more to pay. It's a dirty business that's why I say don't bother paying it because you'll just hurt yourself more.\n\nYou can always build credit by paying your utility bills on time and/or being added onto a loan or line of credit with someone else, but that stain will be there for 7 years. I learned this the hard way as I received inheritance from my parents passing and paid $15K of that to Discover (originally $6.5K of outstanding unpaid debt) which their collections happily accepted only to see it took 7 years to fall off my credit report. Yes they will send you letters and maybe call but give them a PO Box address and a Google voice number to call so their bitching can fall into an abyss that will not bother you.",

        "body": "Hi, I've worked in medical billing for almost 10 years. \n\nFirst and foremost, you need to get this figured out ASAP. It has already gone on too long - insurance companies have a *very* strict window on how long a provider has to send them a claim. This can be as little as 90 days or as long as 365 days. If the hospital/provider can't rebill their claim to insurance, you will be liable for whatever balance is unpaid. \n\n\nIf you are unsure if this balance is truly owed by you, you'll want to call your insurance first. Have them send you what is called an \"EOB\" (explanation of bill/balance). This EOB will tell you exactly what insurance was billed, what they covered, and what they are stating you owe. This should match exactly with what the hospital is reflecting you owe. Make sure you are comparing the correct amounts as sometimes complicated bills like births or surgery can be split up into different claims. The fee for the physician/surgeon, for example, will sometimes be separate from the actual cost of your hospital stay and that can sometimes also be separate from anethesia. Make sure you're comparing the same bills. \n\n\nIf your insurance is stating you owe something different than the hospital, then you'll need to contact the hospital and have it corrected. Sometimes its beneficial to have your insurance call them with you on the line. Make it clear that your insurance is reflecting a different owed amount than the hospital and have them explain where that amount is coming from. If the hospital has their amount incorrect, they'll need to fix it and this should reset the collection process from zero. If the collection process starts over, then the hospital may have some programs you qualify for that could help take some amount off the top but you'll still be responsible for whatever your balance is. \n\n\nIf the hospital and your insurance are reflecting the same amount, you have fewer options. Your two options are to settle with the collection agency if you can pay in full as they'll usually give you a good discount if you do. If you can't pay in full, then you need to set up a repayment plan. They may or may not charge interest, so you need to keep on top of it. \n\nI hope this helps!",

Ceilings can also be deadened with more drywall but this is slightly less DIY friendly\n\nSelling a place is a lot of work, anxiety and money. You can afford it but I'd suggest making it your own before you pull the plug on it",

I think this is a peace of mind question, and it sounds like from my perspective for your peace of mind, and your emotional well-being I would move out. I would in a few weeks request a vacation day or two. And start looking now to do apartment tours on those days (it will take a week or two to set them up, sadly most leasing places aren't that organized). And I would decide where I would be moving to. Look at least at 2-3 places. Don't sign a lease that day for any of them. You need to let it percolate, then decide. Then move out. Book the movers if you have furniture, if you don't and it fits in your car, you can do it by yourself in a weekend. Give notice to your dad as needed. Your emotional well being at this point in this post reads way more important than padding that emergency fund.¬†\n\n\nIf you have been living with your parents and saving 2k a month for a while you should have a very healthy savings account. You hopefully should be able to find something that rents for less than rent plus utilities for less that 2k, ideally less than 1500 a month. If you cannot find that, look for rooms to sublet/rent with roommates that don't tie you into a long-term lease that you can afford or rooms on Airbnb for example. But serious mental illness recovery combined with emotionally unwell environment does not sound like a healthy environment.¬†\n\n\nI think my calculation would be if the cost of rent plus utilities plus what I would need to bare minimum to have in savings to feel comfortable is less than or equal to 2000 a month, I would more out ASAP.¬†\n\n\nYou can help your mom from a distance too.

When considering investing always consider your tolerance for risk and how quickly you could need your money.  \nRisk is abstract and (usually) can not be numerated, so it's perfectly OK to make up a number based on how it makes you feel.

Paying for college next year or a house, much lower risk tolerance.  \nIf you're about to close on a house you'll likely have enough time to pull your money out of a bank account or a mutual fund which could take a couple weeks but not if you are in 12 month CD.",

At least after that, your ex won't have the car, they'll sell it and reduce the debt you owe significantly, and you can pretend like the repo people must have followed you looking for it.",

If there's even a small chance they cannot, I wouldn't entertain cosigning.

Because it may allow them to get their foot in the door, make all their payments on time, their landlord may not require you to cosign additional leases or you could maybe say at the start that this will be the only time you'll do it. Different cultures have different expectations on caring for parents as an adult - personally I don't think you have any obligation at all, but I've had family cosign for grandparents/cousins' student loans, leases, car loans, etc. It happens a lot and when you say everything reads as \"bad news\", that's probably mostly because the ones that work out just fine aren't ending up as a story on the internet. \n\nFramed another way, if they told you they were about to be kicked out unless you were to help pay this month's rent - would you do it?",

Is this an exclusive school and they are getting a huge discount because your wife will work there?\n\nWhat gives me pause is that the top private schools pay more than public schools; otherwise they wouldn't be able to offer better education and get the best professors/teachers. Some also hire PhDS for high schools that were teaching at colleges. This private school that is charging a lot is paying your wife LESS than the public school? I think it's probably more of a \"I want my kids to go to private and not mingle with kids in public school' instead of a 'this is a school giving you the best education possible'\n\nLet's do math: If you kids are in elementary, let's assume they need to be in school for 10 more years and you pay 880 for 9 months a year. That's 880 \\* 9 \\* 10 = 79200. Let's round it up to 80kThat's without uniform, school supplies, maybe trips, etc. etc. (I think you are paying for 2 kids 800, not 800 per kid)\n\nI used one of the college fund calculators, and if you put the yearly tuition in a college fund, the kids would have **124,988** each at 18 (I assumed they are 8). That's close to enough to pay for 4-years of college for a in-state tuition with some scholarships.\n\nThe only way the school helps is if this is a super exclusive school and not a religious school or something like that. I have a friend whose kid went to one that's among the top high schools in the US and the school is like a mini college, and they got a full ride to a university in the Honor's college with tons of 'extras'. But again, this was a TOP school which paid their teachers well.\n\nHowever, if that's not the case, then your kids will still need funding for college. Also, what if your wife has to switch jobs? Are you going to move your kids into public school?\n\nFinally, technically, you are not paying 800 per month. You are paying 800 + loss of money. So 8 \\* 9 = 7200 + 10,000 your wife is getting cut = 17,200 a year",

But think of it this way. I didn't get this until I got older and had plenty of money to realize. Long, low interest loans when you have stable income and are still above water monthly is a way to make more money with you money than just buying things outright.\n\nSo please, for the love of God, don't pay that off early or pay a penny to refinance it for any reason (unless you find a grail level loan that will give you 0.5% interest in the future)\n\nYou have enough money to put equal that payment in an S&P ETF monthly starting today. If you do that, based on the average annual growth of the s&p over the last 30 years, you'll end up making 12k total through the 6 years  investment and paying your note each month.  If you choose to use that 500 a month to pay it off earlier, yes you get out of the loan in 34 months, but you leave $3500 on the table through loss of that 34 months of 500 from compounding over that 6 years of in month 35 you swing to investing 1000 a month for the remainder of it 72 months.\n\nSo if I were in your position, I'd let go of the remorse unless you just don't like the vehicle now that it's your daily driver. That's a separate issue from the money side of it.  And if you are worried about emergency loss of income in the 6 years, you putting the money in the investment is still better as a rainy day fund than paying it off early or adding to the money used to borrow the loan by refinancing.",

It was a cheap payment, and I hate buying cars.\n\nThe way I saw it at the time, is I could buy my lightly used car for a known price and I knew it wasn't a lemon and that it was maintained properly by my standards (oil changes, etc).  \n\nSo in the end I probably paid a couple thousand more for that car and I paid it off in seven years (36mo lease + 48mo finance).  Again I wouldn't do it today because it is typically more expensive and I can now pay cash for a car that suits my needs.  But I drove that car into the dirt over 14 years and the payments weren't burdensome.  \n\nBy the end it was leaking and burning oil, so I bought a vehicle my in-laws were trading in at the time for the value they were offered, but I digress.\n\nPeople in the comments will give you more specific advice around what makes sense from a pure financial standpoint (rightfully so, this is r/personalfinance after all).  My experience is that while it was a bit inefficient financially, I had a reliable car that got me through my mid 20s and into late 30s while I had student loans and then a mortgage to pay, and I survived it.",

I say this as a native homegrown cracker but FL is simply insane.\n\n\nIn the 6 years we owned a house there:\n¬†- groceries nearly tripled in price\n¬†- home insurance doubled\n¬†- forced to get a new roof due to insurance*\n¬†- car insurance went from $150/Mo to almost $500/mo*\n¬†- any meaningful upgrade from our starter 1k sq ft house was over $400k, would cause property taxes to nearly triple and would still be under 2k sq ft with a smaller yard -- which to me was insanity giving we bought our house for $100k (granted we also sold at nearly $275k so we made out with the insane price explosion)\n\n\n* Insurance... In FL, essentially nobody will write a new policy if the roof is older than 15 years. You start getting threats of, or actually, dropped once the roof gets closer to 20 years. This is on a 25 year warranty architect shingle roof with zero damage and certified by multiple roofing companies who inspected it so we could appeal *and* the insurance company's own inspector finding no issue\n\n\n* Car insurance is partially our own fault. 2 car accidents within 3 years, even though both were ruled 100% not our fault (FL is no fault but in both cases other drivers got tickets and we did not). Due to a regulation or rule or whichever, in FL, those 2 within that timeframe suddenly count against you and it drove our insurance up significantly.\n\n\nWe ended up moving out of state and our property insurance dropped - no exaggeration - 70%, property taxes on the house is 50% less and car insurance went back down to $175/mo. Now, granted, other aspects DID increase in cost (giving up our 2.7% mortgage, general cost of living higher etc, now having to pay property taxes of vehicles, now having income tax).\n\n\nUltimately it's probably 15-20% more expensive but our house is newer, more than double the size (admittedly probably a tad too big but works for our family size) and generally have a better quality of life, not to mention significantly higher selection of stores to shop at in nearly every category, ditto to places of service (think spa, mechanics, basically anything selling a service vs goods).\n\n\nLove FL but I don't see ever living there again and I can't honestly recommend it to anybody.",

Maybe the person who usually processes the deposits went on vacation, and management forgot to delegate it to someone else. Maybe your company's fiscal year recently ended, and there was a brief moratorium on bank transactions. Maybe there was an unexpected cash flow glitch.\n\nIf, on the other hand, it's a long term pattern, you should report it up the chain of command. It won't do you any good to talk to the plan administrator, they aren't the ones transferring the money. Whoever is dropping the ball, their boss - or that person's boss - are the only ones who can get things back on track.\n\nIn my case, both myself and our head of HR were on the same level of the org chart - department directors - and I engaged him via email (so there would be a record). I factually laid out the long delays in deposits, and noted how it appeared to be a systemic failure. I made the point that all it would take would be one disgruntled employee making a complaint to EBSA (the Federal Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration) to bring down a full-on audit of the company's 401(k) plan, and that if shortcomings were found, the fines and compensatory remedies could get quite expensive. I added quote, \"of course, it won't be me making such a complaint, but all it takes is one.\"\n\nIt got the point across. With rare exceptions, the deposits started reaching the plan administrator a day or two *before* payday.\n\nIf your plan does get audited, the Feds can order your employer to compensate employees for missed gains, which not only can be expensive, but the process of calculating those lost gains is a real PITA.",

You're better off contracting wheel repair, paintless dent repair, etc on your own. I've done this and you can find reasonable prices.\n\n* Complete wheel refinish or bent wheel repair I've paid $140-250 per wheel including mount/dismount.\n* Refinish leather seat $150\n* Paintless dent repair can be expensive, $300-500 per panel/dent\n* Windshield I was just quoted $250 installed for Chinese glass, went with $450 for Sekurit climate comfort for $450.

With a current balance of $465k that'd imply you've made roughly $175k in additional payment over the last year and a half.  If that's what you're saying, very impressive.\n\n>If I understand correctly, the current monthly interest owed would remain the same regardless of recasting correct?\n\nCorrect.  Somewhat simplified, your monthly interest charge is equal to loan's APR% \\* $currentBalance / 12.  Since your balance isn't changing (until new payments occur) and your APR isn't changing, next month's interest charge would be identical whether or not you recast today.\n\nEach payment goes to interest \"first\", then principal, then escrow (might have those last two flipped, but doesn't really matter as long as you're meeting minimum payment).  That means that any extra payment you make in a given month will have have the same amount go towards paying down principle whether you've done the recast or not.\n\nThe main thing recasting does is reduce your required monthly payment because the bank re-amortizes your loan from its current balance and APR out to the same end date as the original mortgage.  Since you're \"paid ahead\" due to your lump-sums, less is necessary in each of those 343 remaining months to reach $0 owed.\n\nIf you take advantage of that lower amount, you somewhat \"lose\" the earlier payoff that would've happened without the recast if you went back to only required payment.  Under your original setup, you were likely to reach $0 owed about 4 years early (so in 26 years vs. 30).  Under the recast, if you stuck to only the new $2900 monthly payment you'd reach $0 at the original 30 year payoff date.\n\nIf you intend to simply continue making extra payments, I believe you'd be paid off on the same date whether you recast or not.  \n\nThat \"lower required payment\" does offer you a bit more flexibility around your future cash flow.  If you had a rough month with a lot of unexpected expenses, you'd have a $1100 \"buffer\" of money that doesn't have to go out for your mortgage if you didn't want it to.  That has some potential value, alongside the higher chance of being net positive if you go the rental route.",

If ture, you are off to a great start. \n\nWhat I would say is #1, do not fall into the trap that because you can now afford more things you should buy it. AFter you put about 12-15% in 401k, taxes and social security, benifits will likely take another 20% per check. Since this is all new money you technically have been able to live without for years, that extra 60% should be allocated where most of that can now be invested in your own personal accounts (i.e. bonds that track S&P 500, HYSA for future house purchase, etc). I would say maybe half of that 60% should be invested in your future and your kids future. The rest of the 30% can be used to either bring down any debt and a small portion, personal spending, and a very small percent should be anything you may want to buy the kids. or yourselves to lavish yourselves a bit. This could be travel, trips, toys, a new tv, etc. \n\nChange the percentages how you see fit. The problem is if you now think about it as \"an extra 57k, we can get a brand new 60k car where we all fit, a bigger apartment, a newer house, etc.\" Then with your 57k income you somehow have loans topping over 100k, your spending is alot more than you earn, and you somehow are in a worse position than you were before.",

I think correcting spending is much easier to solve for than needing to increase income. \n\nI've been there, believe me. There was one point I was 120 days late on my car loan, I can't believe they never tried to repossess the car. I think I was nearly $2k behind in payments, and what's really embarrassing is that I made plenty of money to cover all my expenses with a lot of cushion, but I had a spending problem. In other words, I had no business being $2k behind my car loan. I got caught up by paying $700 with every biweekly paycheck. Last month, I sent in my last payment due, 1 month earlier than the original 72-month loan! Next month, I'm sending in my final payment on a personal loan that I took out, like you, to pay off credit card balances (which I also later maxed out again--I've paid them off since and am keeping it that way!)

This might be a good option if you could get a significantly lower interest rate on a loan you could make reasonable monthly payments on depending on the term of the loan. You can check with various lenders; you may or may not qualify. \n\nThe other option would be to continue buckling down and pay off the credit cards as they are. Pay minimums on all cards (if there are multiple) and then pay extra on top of the largest interest rate card. Do not just make minimum payments unless it's all you can make - this will drastically prolong the length of the debt. $12k in consumer/bad debt is something I'd put off saving very much for - meaning that you should be paying your regular bills and then putting the rest of your income into your debt - don't just cut down on impulsive spending, eliminate it. You could consider saving up for a 1-3mo emergency fund for buffer depending on how secure you feel in your current job. \n\nIt's daunting, but there's plenty of worse debts out there.

They looked at your situation and decided you were too risky for their standards.  Doing multiple applications at the same time might not even have a been factor, there can be some lag before an event (first bank doing a hard inquiry) and its impact on your credit score.  I thought multiple inquiries from the same sort of product application (mortgage, credit card, auto loan) tended to get treated as one, since many people will shop around for that kind of thing.  I could be wrong on that, though.\n\nHard as it may be to hear, your options boil down to:\n\n* Keep making payments on this loan from current income.  As long as your payments are above what you're charging to these cards each month (ideally $0 but that's not always viable) and keep that up it'll get paid off eventually.  \n* Find some other product where you can borrow enough money to pay the card(s) off.  This doesn't really \"fix\" the problem.  You'll owe the same total (might be more with fees), just hopefully under less expensive terms.  Borrowing your way out of high-interest debt isn't a perfect solution, but can sometimes be a mechanism to pare down the length of time you're in debt because less in interest accrues along the way.\n\nHow long \"eventually\" ends up being (under either strategy) depends on how much money you can throw at it each month.  That might mean cutting expenses you can live without for a while.  Might mean finding additional sources of income: selling possession that have some value, gig work, etc.  Or both.\n\nWhat level of income are you getting from your work right now?  How much are your \"must pay\" bills each month?  $12k would be tough to get rid of if you only have a few hundred dollars a month to spare, easier if you have $1-2k.",

Credit utilization looks at various factors such as % of overall utilization, % of per account utilization, % of accounts reporting balance, and there are also some dollar amount variables.\n\nIn other words if you have a $500 limit card reporting $450 balance your scores will drop for a \"maxed out\" account even if you have 10 other cards with $300k of credit limits.\n\nAlso keep in mind the contents of your credit report matter. You can have 1 or 2 $800 limit cards and a decent 740 credit score, but you'll be much less likely to get approved for loans compared to having $20k credit limits.\n\nIn some limited cases, usually with subprime banks such as Capital One, spending more might lower your credit scores in the short term but help you get credit limit increases.

From the brokerage account I'd start by putting either all or half 4500-9000 into an S&P 500 index fund, I think Vanguard has the lowest management fees. You'll end up following the market news more closely and when you get more cash to invest you'll have more insight. Then you need to raise your monthly income, probably by getting another job. I don't have much insight in that, but a full time job would come with health insurance which is more important than you might think at your age.",

I believe there are benefits to having a mix of tax treatments once you reach retirement and start drawing from your saved balance.  Withdrawals from a Traditional retirement account goes through more-or-less the same treatment as your regular income does now: distributions get included in your \"Adjusted Gross Income\", standard/itemized deduction subtracted to get your \"taxable income\", then that amount gets process through the tax brackets starting from the bottom one (currently 10%) and up until all that taxable income has been accounted for.\n\nThat means a single retired person retired who this year takes out only $15k from a tax deferred account still ends up paying $0 in tax on those dollars, despite not being taxed on those contributions/earnings in the past.  Then the next $12k is taxed at 10% (costing only $1200 in tax on $27k of withdrawal), and so on.\n\nThat is oversimplified, since there could be other sources of taxable income raising the cost of those retirement withdrawals, how much tax was saved on past contributions, potential future tax code changes, etc.  \n\nMy own personal goal is to reach retirement with a mix of roughly 1/3 Roth + 2/3 taxable.  The taxable balance gets enough withdrawn each year to \"fill up\" the standard deduction + lowest one or two brackets, with tax-free Roth withdrawals to cover spending needs beyond that.  I admit, there's not a lot of mathematical rigor in how I picked that breakdown, but playing around with some spreadsheets made it look like a reasonable plan.  And I may have to re-evaluate as I get closer to retirement (so less uncertainty on my starting point) to factor in required minimum distributions; mandatory withdrawals from tax deferred retirement accounts starting in your 70s.",

They are legally required to research it and if the proof is there they will correct it.\n3. Don‚Äôt take out any more new debt! No cards at the store, no new car, etc. \n4. Check out resources in your city or county for credit counseling. There should be free options through a nonprofit or through the city. \n5.

I was in a similar situation around the same age and dug my way out.\n\nThe most important thing you can do to improve your credit is to never miss payments on any loans or debt service (like credit cards). This will take time but you will see results eventually. Even if you can only afford a minimum payment at the time, be sure to make that payment.\n\nThe other thing you need to do is get your credit report and look it over very carefully. Credit reports have a dispute process which allow you to report things that don't belong. My wife disputed an erroneous item that an asshole cable company reported and her score jumped almost 50 points after it was taken off.\n\nThe last thing you can do is what your buddy suggested. Call the places you owe money to and negotiate a sensible repayment plan that you can afford. Companies will always prefer getting paid back over you defaulting on debt. Showing steady debt repayment over time will improve your credit to debt ratio and improve your credit score.\n\nLastly, don't overspend (if this is an issue for you). You should consider budgeting your expenses to avoid trouble with debt. Even if you're aren't strict with spending limits at first, budgeting helps you get an idea of how much money you need for core expenses. This will help you make better spending decisions overall.",

Takes a few days.\n\nYou don't even need the receipts to withdraw. HSAs operate on the honor system. The only time you're going to be asked for proof is if the IRS audits you, and that is extremely unlikely.",

But your provider doesn't have the authority to require that information in order to send you your money.  Those are basically just additional notes for your own records.  Any validation about a given HSA withdrawal being qualified or not is strictly between you and the IRS based on what you claim (and can back up) on your tax return.\n\nIf you have a mix of cash + investments in your HSA, withdrawals can only be done from your cash balance.  So you may have to first execute a \"sell\" transaction on some of your shares to get enough dollars for your desired withdrawal.  That's a separate step from the withdrawal itself, and can take a few business days to finalize before getting accessible cash.\n\nThere may be providers that are less smooth.  Maybe some only mail checks.  Maybe some require paper forms to be filled out and mailed / emailed / faxed to make the reimbursement claim.  But that's not inherent to an HSA, just the bank managing it.  At this point, I'd think anything that old fashioned being the only option would be fairly rare.",

Depending on the cost basis of the stocks that would be sold, you may very well also have to pay capital gains on the stocks that you are being forced to sell.\n\nLong story short, PALs can work well for high net worth individuals where a significant poriton of their wealth is tied up in highly appreciated stocks that they a) believe are going to keep increasing in value, and b) don't want to liquidate to pay capital gains on (yet).",

The account has grown by 25% since that rollover.\n\nIf you're doing calculations, be sure to account for at least 6% growth of your existing balance each year. That's a conservative estimate too.

Adding more risk doesn't guarantee higher returns and can actually result in worse returns in prolonged ~~bull~~ bear markets.  Look up the concept of \"uncompensated risk\" to find out more.\n\nNote that the saving for retirement problem can be attacked from multiple angles:\n\n* Make more money so you can save more\n* Spend less money so you can save more\n* Live more frugally in general so that you don't need as much money to retire\n\nIdeally, you want to combine all three.\n\nYou got this.",

The discount brokerages named above charge no monthly fees for IRAs and taxable accounts.

For you, that might mean maxing out a 401k at $23,500, Doing a \"backdoor Roth\" contribution of $7,000, and then separately saving around $4,000 in a taxable brokerage account.   \n(3) What else do you want?  Many finance people will eventually want to buy a house in the suburbs.  Others will want to stay in the city and buy a nice apartment.  Others will want to leave the industry.  None of those are likely to be \"soon\" for you, but maybe 5-10 years. Aiming to save for a 20% down payment on a $1 million home is not absurd given real estate prices.  That would be $200,000 saved. If we assume 4% returns, saving $25,000 per year or around $2,100 a month would get you there in 7 years. \n\nWhat do you want to spend on now?  If your rent is $2,300, and other bills are $700 and food/ eating out is $1,000, with the above savings, that leaves you $3,200 or so a month.  I'd probably decide to keep $1,500 for fun and $1,500 of that for savings usually.  It seems me that if you have $2,500 for groceries, eating out, dating, you should be able to \"enjoy your 20s,\" even in expensive New York. \n\nThis puts you at a 34% savings rate which means you might be able to retire after around 25 years of working. \n\nWhen you get a bonus, I'd put 34% toward \"fun\" and 66% toward savings. My understanding is these bonuses can be large. ($100k+)  That can absolutely speed up a goal of buying a home or retiring early.  Or, quitting and doing your own thing.  \n\nWhat you are likely to find, though, is that you will be spending WAY WAY less than a lot of your colleagues.  But, if they let their lifestyle inflate, they will be trapped in this job, like it or not \"golden handcuffs.\"  And if the job doesn't work out, they will be financially devastated.",

As you may know, there is no penalty to remove contributions from Roth.  So there is nothing stopping you from doing what makes you both comfortable for now.

That would have made things much simpler, and likely less costly from a tax perspective.\n\nIf you withdraw the entire $550k in a single year, the tax you owe will be **much** higher than 12%. Some of it may be taxed at 12%, yes, but then some will be taxed at 22%, some at 24%, some at 32%, and some at 35%. You would likely pay less tax overall if you spread the withdrawals out over 10 years rather than taking a lump sum.\n\nYour siblings don't owe any tax on gifts they receive.\n\nRegardless of whether you take the withdrawal in a single year or spread it out, you will want to make sure you determine the actual income tax cost to yourself and split that cost between the 3 of you as well. One way to determine this cost is to mock up a tax return with just your regular income, and see what your total tax is. Then add the IRA withdrawal and see what the difference in tax is.

        "body": "If you were the sole beneficiary of this IRA, then legally it's all your money regardless of what might've been laid out in your parent's will or your state's probate laws.  I'm pretty sure there is no mechanism to retroactively treat your siblings as beneficiaries.  Choosing to gift 1/3 of it each to each sibling outside of the inheritance process is your choice, but as you've said that has its own consequences.\n\nOption 1: Are you still in the probate process?  If there happens to be $370k worth of \"stuff\" for your share in the overall estate, you may propose giving that portion up (I believe the legal term is \"disclaim\") to your siblings in exchange for keeping all the IRA's balance for yourself.  This could be things like partial ownership of property, balance in a cash account, etc.  So each sibling would get an extra $185k from those non-IRA assets and you get the entire $550k IRA.  That feels like something that should involve an estate lawyer to make sure everything gets done properly.  If probate is over, then this is likely no longer an available option.\n\nOption 2: You could cash out the entire $550k this year.  The tax cost of that should come \"from\" the balance before splitting the rest among the three of you.  What that cost is depends on your filing status and how much \"space\" you have left in your 12% bracket.  If you are single at just barely below the next bracket from your regular income, my very rough ballpark estimate for the additional tax from the withdrawal comes to roughly $174k.  You could request that be withheld from the distribution (goes to the IRS in your name as pre-payment), then the $376k remaining cash gets split three ways and each gets $125k.\n\nOption 2b: You could immediately cash out only your siblings' 2/3 share ($370k) and keep your share in the IRA to take out in smaller chunks over the next 10 years.  Tax cost of this size withdrawal is about $110k, so your siblings split the remaining $260k and each gets $130k.  You can then spread out your distributions for a lower tax cost up until the ten year deadline to zero the IRA out.\n\nCalculating the tax impact from either of those may be something worth getting professional direction.  If you're married the cost goes down due to larger brackets.  Having a large reported income could disqualify you from things like deductions/credits you'd otherwise get to claim (tax cost goes up).  And your state may also be taxing those distributions.\n\nOption 3: You spread out the distributions over the next ten years, do the same \"pay tax from distribution\" process as above, and split the rest.  This should be the lowest tax cost, but delays everyone getting money and is more work.\n\nLike many things in life, you can have it easy or you can have it cheap but you can almost never get both.\n\n>I will owe that amount of tax when I pull this money out, will my siblings owe anything on their taxes once that money is gifted to them? Will I owe anything additional come tax season?\n\nGifts are not income for the recipient.  The giver would have to report any amount over $19k gifted to a particular individual during the tax year, a small amount of extra paperwork with your return.  But no tax is owed on that gift until you've gotten over $13 million, so unlikely to come up.  Those are the federal rules, states may have different ones, so you'd need to check your (and possibly siblings') state tax law to see if anything crops up there.",

I‚Äôd check the HSA store and see if there‚Äôs anything you regularly use or products you may need soon. Sometimes if there‚Äôs an expensive item that I want and it‚Äôs covered by HSA, I‚Äôll contribute an extra amount the following month and just buy the item with my HSA so it‚Äôs tax free.\n\nEdit: I misread the first as the red plan, edited to remove that",

It was so bad that I couldn‚Äôt even sell it to junk car company for a couple hundred bucks because I didn‚Äôt own the title. Parking isn‚Äôt abundant where I lived so I couldn‚Äôt just leave the car anywhere while I had to pay the auto loan off. Long story short I had to open a personal loan, pay the car off, wait for title, sell car to a mechanic for like $600.\n\nFast forward to today I just recently paid off a 2022 sedan. I had only put about $4-5k down. My method was simply putting a continuous amount of  cash into my car loan. Depending on your situation, you may just have 1 single stream of receiving money that doesn‚Äôt fluctuate. Or you may have some side gigs etc.\n\nI just continuously transferred money into the loan, several times a week. Whenever I checked my main bank account, I‚Äôd be like okay I can definitely afford $40 right now < transfer to loan.\n\nNext 1-3 days, check bank account, ‚Äúokay I just paid for all this, but‚Ä¶ can I afford $5 right now, ofc. *pays $5 into loan*.\n\nReceived main pay check, straight $100 into loan. End of pay period and about to be paid tomorrow, cool I can throw an extra $300-400 into my car loan.\n\nIt gets much better the closer you get to paying it off, and I have zero regrets about all the times I transferred the smallest amounts that seemed like they didn‚Äôt matter at the time.",

Others may tell you, at your income level, to contribute to the Roth version and pay the tax now, but the danger there is that you'll owe a little bit in tax when you file in April. There is wisdom in that approach, and I wouldn't tell you that contributing to the Roth is wrong.\n\n- There should not be an issue as long as you don't exceed the contribution limit. Note that they will still withhold taxes from your paycheck, but you will get that money back when you file your taxes (assuming you do not otherwise owe).\n\n- If you choose the pre-tax option as I've suggested, you would roll it into a regular (not Roth) IRA. You would then have two accounts - a regular IRA and a Roth IRA. If you choose the Roth version, it will go into your Roth IRA.\n\nThe key difference between a regular IRA and a Roth IRA: The money in the regular IRA has not yet been taxed, so you would pay income taxes at retirement. The money in the Roth IRA has already been taxed, so you would take that out tax-free at retirement. It is legal to have both at once, although the contribution limits are combined. Since you have maxed your Roth, you can not make any regular, non-rollover contributions to a regular IRA this year.",

But auto insurance laws are generally done through the state where the vehicle is registered. If you live in Michigan and registered the vehicle in Michigan and they can't figure out how to move the title from Texas to Michigan without jumping through a hoop that dumb then I'd say that's tough tits for them. But do double check your loan agreement and make sure your Michigan insurance is in line with what you are required to keep on the vehicle. If it is not, they could possibly try to put you in default on the loan, even while making payments, for failing to insure it; or try to force-apply insurance they provide and tac that onto your bill.\n\nI would communicate directly with the CU.",

Look for something closer to work, which is probably what you do most, even if it means longer commutes to other things.\n\nFor a car, you should be able to find a place that'll sell you something for cash. It won't be great, but you could get lucky. Find something you can (learn to) maintain yourself. Don't forget that you'll probably (depending on laws where you live) need insurance, and that'll take your car and credit and location and driving habits and range into consideration. With your income, you should be able to scrape together a few hundred dollars for a total beater, or a few thousand for a reliable beast, in a few paychecks, maybe with some hard choices.\n\nConsider alternatives, too. If you can bike, they tend to be really cheap. You can half-step up from that with an e-bike to extend your range and speed. Or step a full-step up and consider a scooter or motorcycle, if you're able. They can be much less expensive to find than cars, but might not help with taking other people to appointments, or carrying groceries.\n\nAnd you can tier your transportation. Bike for now, scooter or motorcycle or car later.\n\nWithout knowing where you live, or any of the other budget things you should have in control, $75K sounds like a decent amount, and you should be able to find a place and vehicle with a little discipline and sacrifice.",

        "body": "Why is taking out a loan to pay credit card debt a bad idea?\n\nBecause many people are bad at managing credit and income. It's how they got the big debt in the first place.\n\nIf you have control of your budget now, and won't run up more new credit card debt as soon as it's paid off, then a loan isn't a bad idea. \n\nIf you can get even lower interest and better terms from your bank or credit union, or even a different lender, try that. Using multiple lenders you might get lower interest and payments by getting separate smaller loans. \n\nIf you do get the loan, you need to make and stick to a budget plan. If you can cut costs or increase income, that's even better. Figure out why you got in debt, then don't do that again. \n\nIt's hard to avoid hardship costs, and debt is a useful tool to survive short term income loss and costs, but you can't afford that forever, and need to get to a stable income and expenses.\n\nThe good news is that you'll get an immediate boost to your credit score because you paid off debt. If you make sure to pay any new credit card bills in full every month, you'll probably do fine.\n\nYou can even try for a better loan with your better credit score, before the five years are up. That will save you even more money. \n\nThe risk remains that if you are likely to fall short on income, or have extra high expenses, you'll feel the need to tap that 25k of credit to get by. But if you do that, you'll build up your credit card debt, and in five years be in the same situation.",

There is a reason that people end up in deep credit card debt, and while sometimes it really is just a string of bad luck and they seemingly had no other option, the majority of the time its from them not being responsible with their money.  so making an assumption that someone who wasnt responsible with money will start being responsible with money is generally not a good assumption.\n\nSo if you have fixed the behavior side of things that lead to being in debt, then yes, refinancing to lower interest rate debt is a positive thing.  But if you havent fixed the behavior, then refinancing into a personal loan like this is just a good way to end up with not only the personal loan debt that you are working to pay off, but another $10k of credit card debt that you racked up.\n\nmy general recommendation for people is to prove that you have actually fixed the behavior.  Spend 3-4 months doing your detailed budget, and prove that you can do that without running up more debt.  Then after 4 months if you are still on track, then look at doing the personal loan, just dont let up off the gas when you do.",

That cleared up pretty quickly and our scores were back up over 700 within a few months. We financed a car in the middle of the program with no issues.

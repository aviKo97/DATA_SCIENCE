      "content": "The article by Jacopo Berneri: explores how philosophical thinking often begins where contradictions and paradoxes emerge in our everyday concepts. It argues that concepts like \"set\" in mathematics or \"property\" in metaphysics, which seem simple at first, can lead to deep inconsistencies when examined carefully. These paradoxes are not just technical glitches, they reveal limitations in our conceptual frameworks.\n\nBerneri suggests that philosophical labor lies in the slow, difficult process of refining or even rebuilding our ideas in response to these contradictions. Rather than offering final answers, philosophy should be seen as a discipline that embraces complexity and works through conceptual problems with intellectual honesty. Ultimately, the article calls for more appreciation of the hard, unglamorous work involved in serious philosophical thinking.\n\nFinally, Berneri points to the concrete consequences of how we handle contradictions. The decisions we make about logic, categories, properties, concepts etc. all have ramifications for the language we encode into everything from common-sense to our computers, even AI.\n\nRead further in the article if you want a brief run-down on the classic paradoxes of sets and properties, and how they were resolved.",

      "content": "The newly discovered colour Olo, may stumble on Wittgenstein’s Private Language Argument. \n\nAmong the many ideas at play in the argument, naming sensation words, (like pain or colour experiences), is reinvigorated with the naming of Olo. The colour can only be seen after a laser treatment that (de)activates certain cones in the eye of the beholder.\n\nWittgenstein’s argument examines the relationship between public language and private sensations. In this case, what it means to associate a word (like ‘Olo’) with a sensation (ie the experience of seeing the colour). \n\nWittgenstein’s argument shows that the strictly private nature of the experience of Olo (ie the colour is only briefly perceptible after a laser treatment), renders the definition of the word ‘Olo’ meaningless. The claim is that the words of a private language cannot be defined in any meaningful way. \n\n“But still I can give myself a kind of ostensive definition. – How? Can I point to the sensation? Not in the ordinary sense. But I speak, or write the sign down, and at the same time I concentrate my attention on the sensation – and so, as it were, point to it inwardly.” - Philosophical Investigations,  §243.\n\nAgain, the private nature of this definition means that it is impossible to tell whether one has remembered the connection correctly. Whatever seems to be right will be right. There is no difference between believing one is right and actually being right about the connection between the colour sensation and the word. \n\n“And that only means that here we can’t talk about right”.\n",

Such fictional examples, subject to certain constraints, can play a similar role to real cases in establishing the generality of a social phenomenon. Furthermore, the distinct psychological vantage point offered by literature renders it a potent resource for elucidating intricate social dynamics. This advantage of the internal insight that fictional examples can (though do not always) possess helps explain their prevalence in certain areas of philosophy, such as ethics, epistemology, and the philosophy of emotion, in which we can require a more precise characterization of a subject's mental states. While the respective advantages of fictional examples, real cases, and thought experiments clearly depend on many contextual factors, the former have an important, and arguably underappreciated, role to play in philosophical inquiry.",

This paper provides a novel proposal for guiding belief about possibilities via scientific theories. The proposal draws on the notion of an effective theory: a theory that applies very well to a particular, restricted domain. We argue that it is the models of effective theories that we should believe correspond, at least in part, to possibilities. It is thus effective theories that should guide modal reasoning in science.*",

      "title": "Epistemological analysis of The Early Buddhist Texts and their falsifisbility",
      "content": "**Introduction:**\n\nThis post explores the building blocks of postmodern theory and the application of modern epistemological razors to the epistemological framework presented in the Early Buddhist Texts for analysis of their falsifiability. \n\n**1. Problem Statement:**\n\nIn the landscape of philosophical and religious thought, there’s a recurring debate about the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity, as well as the nature of knowledge and truth.\n\nTraditional philosophical frameworks like Hume’s Guillotine and Kantian epistemology  have laid the groundwork for understanding this relationship.\n\nThe emergence of radical postmodern thought further complicates the matters by challenging the very merit of looking for foundations of objectivity.\n\nAmidst this philosophical turmoil, there’s a need for a robust epistemological tool that can cut through the ambiguity and identify the fundamental flaws in various interpretations of reality.\n\n**2. Thesis Statement:**\n\nThe Postmodern Razor offers a powerful framework for evaluating philosophical and religious claims by asserting the impossibility of deriving objective truth about subjective experience exclusively from subjective experience.\n\nBuilding upon Hume’s Razors and Kantian criticism of religion, The Postmodern Razor sharpens the distinction between analytical truths derived from objective reality and synthetic interpretations arising from subjective experiences.\n\nBy emphasizing the limitations of reason and the subjective nature of knowledge, The Postmodern Razor provides a lens through which to critically examine diverse philosophical and religious doctrines.\n\nThrough this framework, we aim to demonstrate that certain claims, such as those found in Early Buddhist Texts regarding the attainment of enlightenment and the nature of reality, remain impervious to logical scrutiny due to their reliance on a supra-empirical verification rather than empirical evidence, logic or reason.\n\n**3. Thesis:**\n\nI've made something of an epistemological razor, merging Hume's Guillotine and Fork, as to sharpen the critique — I call it \"The Postmodern Razor\". I will explain things in brief, as and in as far as I understood. \n\nIt is very similar to Hume's Guillotine which asserts that: 'no ought can be derived from what is'\n\nThe meaning of Hume's statement is in that something being a certain way doesn't tell us that we ought to do something about it. \n\n**Example:** The ocean is salty and it doesn't follow that we should do something about it.\n\n**Analogy 1:** Suppose you are playing an extremely complicated game and do not know the rules. To know what to do in a given situation you need to know something other than what is the circumstance of the game, you need to know the rules and objectives.\n\n**Analogy 2:** Suppose a person only eats one type of food all of his life, he wouldn't be able to say whether it is good or bad food because it's all he knows.\n\nThe Guillotine is also used with Hume's Fork which separates between two kinds of statements \n\n**Analytical** - definitive, eg a cube having six sides (true by definition)\n\n**Synthetic** - a human has two thumbs (not true by definition because not having two thumbs doesn't disqualify the designation 'a human').\n\nOne can derive that \n\nAny variant subjective interpretation of what is - is a synthetic interpretation.\n\nThe objective interpretation of what is - an analytical interpretation.\n\nIt folllows that no objective interpretation of existence can be derived from studying subjective existence exclusively.\n\nThe popularized implication of Hume's Law is in that: no morality can be derived from studying what is not morality.\n\nIn other words, what should be cannot be inferred exclusively from what is.\n\nI basically sharpened this thing to be a postmodern \"Scripture Shredder\", meant to falsify all pseudo-analytical interpretations of existence on principle.\n\n**The Postmodern Razor asserts: no objectivity from subjectivity; or no analysis from synthesis.**\n\nThe meaning here is in that \n\nNo analytical truth about the synthesized can be synthesized by exclusively studying the synthesized. To know the analytical truth about the synthesized one has to somehow know the unsynthesized as a whatnot that it is.\n\nIn other words, no analytical interpretation of subjective existence can arise without a coming to know the not-being [of existence] as a whatnot that it is.\n\n**The Building Blocks Of Postmodern Theory: Kantian Philosophy**\n\nKant, in his \"Critique of Reason\", asserts that Logos can not know reality, for it's scope is limited to it’s own constructs. Kant states that one has to reject logic to make room for faith, because reasoning alone can not justify religion.\n\nThis was a radical critique of logic, in western philosophy, nobody had popularized this general of an assertion before Kant.\n\nHe reasoned that the mind can in principle only be oriented towards reconstruction of itself based on subjective conception & perception and so therefore knowledge is limited to the scope of feeling & perception. It follows therefore that knowledge itself is subjective in principle.\n\nIt also follows that minds can not align on matters of cosmology because of running into contradictions and a lack of means to test hypotheses. Thus he concluded that reasoning about things like cosmology is useless because there can be no basis for agreement and we should stop asking these questions, for such unifying truth is inaccessible to mind\n\n**Post Kantian Philosophy**\n\nHegel thought that contradictions are only a problem if you decide that they are a problem, and suggested that new means of knowing could be discovered so as to not succumb to the antithesis of pursuing a unifying truth.\n\nHe theorized about a kind of reasoning which somehow embraces contradiction & paradox. \n\nKierkegaard agreed in that it is not unreasonable to suggest that not all means of knowing have been discovered. And that the attainment of truth might require a leap of faith.\n\nSchopenhauer asserted that logic is secondary to emotive apprehension and that it is through sensation that we grasp reality rather than by hammering it out with rigid logic.\n\nNietzche agreed and wrote about ‘genealogy of morality’. He reasoned that the succumbing to reason entails an oppressive denial of one's instinctual drives and that this was a pitiful state of existence. He thought people in the future would tap into their deepest drives & will for power, and that the logos would be used to strategize the channeling of all one's effort into that direction.\n\nHeidegger laid the groundwork for the postmodernists of the 20th century. He identified with the Kantian tradition and pointed out that it is not reasonable to ask questions like ‘why existence exists?’ Because the answer would require coming to know what is not included in the scope of existence. Yet he pointed out that these questions are emotively profound & stirring to him, and so where logic dictates setting those questions aside, he has a hunger for it’s pursuit, and he entertains a pursuit of knowledge in a non-verbal & emotive way. He thought that contradictions & paradoxes mean that we are onto something important and feeling here ought to trump logic.\n\n**The Postmodern Razor**\n\nBased on these principles The Postmodern Razor falsifies any claim to analytical truth being synthesized without coming to know the not-coming-into-play of existence as a whatnot that it is.\n\n**Putting the Razor to the Early Buddhist Texts**\n\nKey Excerpts:\n\n*This, bhikkhu, is a designation for the element of Nibbāna (lit. Extinguishment): the removal of lust, the removal of hatred, the removal of delusion. The destruction of the taints is spoken of in that way.” - SN45.7*\n\n*The cessation of existence is nibbāna; the cessation of existence is nibbāna.’-AN10.7*\n\n*There he addressed the mendicants: “Reverends, extinguishment is bliss! Extinguishment is bliss!”*\n\n*When he said this, Venerable Udāyī said to him, “But Reverend Sāriputta, what’s blissful about it, since nothing is felt?”*\n\n*“The fact that nothing is felt is precisely what’s blissful about it.  -AN9.34*\n\n*'Whatever is felt has the designation suffering.' That I have stated simply in connection with the inconstancy of fabrications. That I have stated simply in connection with the nature of fabrications to end... in connection with the nature of fabrications to fall away... to fade away... to cease... in connection with the nature of fabrications to change. -SN36.11*\n\n*There is, monks, an unborn — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated. If there were not that unborn — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated, there would not be the case that escape from the born — become — made — fabricated would be discerned. But precisely because there is an unborn — unbecome — unmade — unfabricated, escape from the born — become — made — fabricated is discerned. - Ud8.3*\n\n*The born, become, produced, made, fabricated, impermanent, fabricated of aging & death, a nest of illnesses, perishing, come-into-being through nourishment and the guide [that is craving] — is unfit for delight. The escape from that is calm, permanent, a sphere beyond conjecture, unborn, unproduced, the sorrowless, stainless state, the cessation of all suffering, stilling-of-fabrications bliss. -Iti43*\n\n*Where neither water nor yet earth, nor fire nor air gain a foothold, there gleam no stars, no sun sheds light, there shines no moon, yet there no darkness found. When a sage, a brahman, has come to know this, for himself through his own wisdom, then he is freed from form and formless. Freed from pleasure and from pain. -Ud1.10*\n\n*He understands what exists, what is low, what is excellent, and what escape there is from this field of perception. -MN7*\n\n*\"Now it’s possible, Ananda, that some wanderers of other persuasions might say, ‘Gotama the contemplative speaks of the cessation of perception & feeling and yet describes it as pleasure. What is this? How can this be?’ When they say that, they are to be told, ‘It’s not the case, friends, that the Blessed One describes only pleasant feeling as included under pleasure. Wherever pleasure is found, in whatever terms, the Blessed One describes it as pleasure.’” -MN59*\n\n\n**Result:**\n\nThese texts don't get \"cut\" by the razor because they don't make objective claims about reality based solely on subjective experiences.\n\nInstead, they offer a new way of knowing through achieving a state of \"cessation of perception & feeling\" which goes beyond observation and subjective experience.\n\nThis \"cessation-extinguishment\" is described as the pleasure in a definitive sense and possible because there is an unmade truth & reality.\n\nThe Buddha is making an irrefutable statement inviting a direct verification.\n\nIt's not a hypothesis because these are unverifiable and it's not a theory because theories are falsifiable. \n\n***The cessation does not require empirical proof because it is the non empirical proof.***\n\nThe Unconstructed truth, can not be inferred from the constructed or empirically verified otherwise. Anything that can be inferred from the constructed is just another constructed thing. If you’re relying on inference, logic, or empirical verification, you’re still operating within the scope of constructed phenomena. The unmade isn’t something that can be grasped that way—it’s realized through direct cessation, not conceptualization or subjective existence. Therefore it is always explained as what it is not.\n\nKantian epistemology and it's insight cuts off wrong views but remains incomplete in that it overlooks the dependent origination of synthesis and the possibility of the cessation of synthesis. \n\nThus, Kant correctly negates but doesn't transcend. The Buddha completes what Kant leaves unresolved by demonstrating that the so-called \"noumenal\" is not an objective reality lurking beyond experience but simply it's cessation.\n\nThere is a general exhortation: \n\n*Whatever phenomena arise from cause: their cause and their cessation. Such is the teaching of the Tathagata, the Great Contemplative.—Mv 1.23.1-10*\n\nThis is what remains overlooked in postmodernity. The persistence of synthesis is taken for granted, the causes unexplored, and this has been a philosophical dead-end defining postmodernity.\n\nBuddhas teach how to realize the cessation of synthesis (sankharānirodha) as a whatnot that it is. The four noble truths that he postulates based on this — are analytical (true by definition) and the synthesis is called \"suffering\" because it's cessation is the definitive pleasure where nothing is felt.\n\n*This noble truth of the cessation of suffering is to be directly experienced’ -SN56.11*\n\n*Very good. Both formerly & now, it is only suffering that I describe, and the cessation of suffering.\" -SN22.86*\n\nThus, verily, The Buddha is making an appeal to the deep emotive drives of the likes of Nietzche, Heidegger and Schopenhauer, in proclaiming the principal cessation of feeling & perception to be the most extreme pleasure & happiness, a type of undiscovered knowing which was rightly asserted to require a leap of faith.\n\nFaith, in this context, isn’t just blind belief — it’s a trust in something which we can't falsify, a process that leads to direct verification. The cessation of perception and feeling isn’t something one can prove to another person through measurement or inference. It requires a leap—the willingness to commit to a path without empirical guarantees, trusting that the attainment itself will be the proof.\n\n**4. Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, we think that the limitation of the razor represents a significant advancement in epistemological research, and the lens of Hume's Laws a sophisticated tool for navigating the complexities of philosophical and religious discourse.\n\nBy recognizing the interplay between subjectivity and objectivity, analysis and synthesis, this framework enables a more nuanced understanding of truth and knowledge, highlighting the inherent limitations and biases that shape human cognition.\n\nWhile not without its challenges and potential criticisms, The Postmodern Razor ultimately empowers individuals to engage critically with diverse perspectives, fostering a richer and more inclusive dialogue about the nature of reality and our place within it.\n\n**5. Anticipated Criticisms:**\n\nCritics may assert that the work  proposed “discounting subjective experience” altogether as a means of obtaining objective knowledge. \n\nHowever, it’s important to clarify that the framework offers a nuanced perspective that acknowledges the inherent limitations of human cognition while still valuing critical inquiry, empirical evidence and axiom praxis.\n\nHere it would be important to clarify that the whole purpose of this analysis is **to protect** a specific class of experience — namely, the cessation of synthesis — from being misunderstood.\n\nFurthermore the work may be perceived as defending materialist empiricism. It’s not. It’s challenging the epistemological inflation that happens when people make objective or universal claims based solely on subjective experience, without acknowledging the limits of what subjectivity can ground. It is an attempt to articulate a path that doesn’t reject subjectivity, but also doesn’t derive objectivity from it — rather, it proposes that subjectivity itself can collapse, and that such a cessation isn't conceptual speculation, but direct verification by a kind of knowing that’s neither analytical nor synthetic.\n\nSo this isn’t scientism vs. metaphysics. It’s a call to be more precise about how we claim to know what we think we know — and what sort of knowing becomes possible once the “synthesized” stops spinning altogether.\nThus, this is not a dismissal of metaphysics. It’s a reframing of it. From speculation about what lies beyond, to silence about what remains when everything else ceases.\n\nAnother potential criticism would want to dismiss non-empirical means of verification.\n\nHere it is important to clarify that whilst the claims presented in the Early Buddhist Texts remain empirically unverifiable—they are set apart as being epistemologically irrefutable and therefore categorically different from traditional frameworks which require faith forever and remain falsifiable by well-established principles.\n\nEither way, when it comes to faith—there are no empirical guarantees.\n\nUltimately, the framework provided by The Postmodern Razor encourages a deeper engagement with philosophical and religious texts, challenging readers to confront the complexities of existence rather than settling for simplistic or dogmatic interpretations.",

      "content": "(if you don't care about details see TLDR at the bottom) To clear some things out of the way, this comes from multiple years of amateur research in physics, and I personally believe that the universe has always existed. I don't mean this presentation of our universe that began with the big bang; I mean existence in its totality. This is, of course, the precursor to the Boltzmann brain. I will absolutely grant that Boltzmann brains have almost certainly existed under this idea and will continue to exist, but out knowledge of physics pretty firmly sais that they are much, MUCH rarer than naturally occurring brains.\n\nFor a Boltzmann brain to exist, a brain needs to form from randomness (obviously) and of course this is inevitable, but lets think about what needs to happen. For something as (or likely more) complex as a human brain to form, that requires a lot of very very specific things to all go absolutely perfect, as well as a few other things to be set to feed it nutrients for at least a few seconds to form your moment of consciousness. And of course it has to happen to form with a sensible form of thought that also happens to form an entire human life, a model of the minds inner world, and much more. And all of this has to form within a few minutes maximum of itself otherwise while the rest of the brain is forming other parts may decay or break down.\n\nNow lets think of what needs to happen for a 'natural' human brain to form. A universe needs to be created, it needs to have stars and planets and those planets need to have a diverse and particular collection of molecules that allows life to form, as well as other things life needs like being in the habitable zone, not tidally locked etc. Then, complex life and consciousness needs to evolve, and finally that life turns into a human civilization where one of its inhabitants lives a life to form memories and consciousness over time. Seems pretty unlikely doesn't it?\n\nThats how the question is usually framed but there's one major problem with this. Thats what happens on the way to form a human brain, sure, but what does the universe really need to do to start that in motion? Turns out, we know enough about physics to know exactly what you need to start a big bang (assuming were right). All that's needed is time (which we have infinite of) and a sufficiently small and massive blob of general energy. That's it. Any collection somewhat similar to the one that started our universe will work, and create pretty much the same thing. This is already orders of magnitude more likely than a Boltzmann brain, since under this a (sufficiently large) failed Boltzmann brain could just become a universe. And even more, about 100 billion humans have lived by our estimates. One single universe has already created at minimum 100,000,000,000 naturally conscious minds (ignoring other animals potentially being conscious as well, and the potential of other planets having just as much conscious life even if we haven't found them yet) So really, the chances of you being a Boltzmann brain might as well be zero, since the chance of one forming is astronomically smaller than any good enough blob of energy that would create potentially trillions to quadrillions of brains. Obviously yeah, you could be a Boltzmann brain, but you almost certainly aren't.\n\n  \nTLDR: A Boltzmann brain requires a brain to form; a universe that hosts natural brains requires any sufficiently large blob of energy to form, and will create maybe trillions or more brains. The argument of you being a Boltzmann brain is framed in a way that hides how easy it is for a universe to form (relatively), and in reality you are almost certainly not a Boltzmann brain.\n\nMaybe this clears someone's existential anxiety, or maybe you think I'm wrong. If you do please explain in the comments I would love to hear what you think.",

      "title": "Parallels between Intelligent Design and criticism of Large Language Models",
      "content": "**Summary**\n\nThere are some similarities between arguments about the unreliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on next token prediction and arguments about the unreliability of human minds that have evolved as a result of natural selection for survival and reproduction, as opposed to accurate representation of external reality. My contention is that some AI skeptic arguments closely resemble \"intelligent design\" arguments and can be answered along similar lines. At the very least, the parallels show that some of the supposed limitations of AI systems also apply to human beings if you accept evolution as true.\n\n**Critiques of LLMs**\n\nThe argument that LLMs don't and can't \"think\", represent knowledge or model external reality because they are only concerned with statistical prediction of word/token sequences is fairly widespread, one example is [here] (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5). The authors argue that LLMs (specifically ChatGPT) are \"bullshitters\" that are indifferent to the truth, because they work by modelling statistically plausible text rather than providing factually accurate responses. Of course, it is true that LLM chatbots are trained on next-token prediction (although they are also trained using reinforcement learning and are influenced by \"system prompts\" that direct their behaviour). It's also true that LLM chatbots often produce factually incorrect output. The question I'm interested in is whether training on next token prediction *in principle* limits an LLM from reliably modelling reality.\n\n**Critiques of Human Cognition**\n\nThe argument that if human brains are a result of evolution through natural selection then they are unreliable \"truth trackers\" is popular with intelligent design believers, one example being Alvin Plantinga in his [\"Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_argument_against_naturalism) (EAAN) - although there is more to the EAAN than that. Plantinga gives some examples of false beliefs that may lead to evolutionarily adaptive behaviour, and since it's the latter that natural selection rewards, we can't trust nervous systems that are the product of natural selection to reliably perceive or express truth. Even if these organisms were to express truthful beliefs, the truthfulness would only ever be incidental - an accidental byproduct of a process that is concerned with other criteria. In a similar way, an LLM might output a true statement, but that's also said to be incidental and accidental to the next token prediction task.\n\n**Parallels**\n\nThe crux of it is whether a complex system that has been tuned by some process to do one thing can reliably do another, when the criteria for success of the second thing only partially overlaps with the first.\n\nIn the case of an LLM, the fitness function is accuracy predicting the next token in a sequence, and the process is training using the back-propagation algorithm which reinforces model weights that tend contribute to correct predictions and weakens weights that don't. The scale being brought to bear is the number of parameters in the model and number of training rounds, and the search space is the billions of dimensions defined by the model weights. In the case of evolution, the fitness function is (effectively) the ability to pass genes on to the next generation, and the process is natural selection, which increases the frequency of alleles that contribute to reproductive success and decreases the frequency of those that don't. The scale being brought to bear is millions of years of evolution and the search space is the set of all possible configurations or combinations of biological traits, genetic sequences, or phenotypic characteristics.\n\nOf course, there are differences — humans operate in a physical and social world, while LLMs exist in a purely linguistic space. It's also true that evolution doesn't operate directly on the connections between neurons in human brains the way LLM training works on connection weights. However, this doesn't negate the parallel that both are shaped by optimization processes not explicitly aimed at truth-seeking.\n\n**Shared Objections to the Critiques**\n\nOne of the objections to Plantinga's claims is that even if it is not directly selected for by natural selection, accurately modelling the world has obvious survival and therefore reproductive advantages. For example being mistaken about whether a noise in the bush is a predator or just the wind could mean the difference between life and death. However, a parallel argument can be made about LLMs: an accurate world model implicitly encoded within their model weights (or to be more precise a model of the speaker's mental world model) would be an advantage in predicting the next word out of a speaker's mouth. Because it implicitly models the mental world models of millions of speakers and writers, an LLM could effectively model a consensus reality - a shared world model. Regardless of whether the current generations of LLMs actually have this capability - just the fact that it confers an advantage means that the next-token-prediction goal and the world-modelling goals could plausibly converge, which means that being \"just\" token-predictors doesn't categorically prevent LLMs from being accurate and reliable world-modellers. The \"just\" is also misplaced, because world-modelling is a lesser subgoal of the token-prediction goal, and not the other way around.\n\nI would even go further and suggest that the next-token-prediction goal aligns more closely with \"truth tracking\" than the survival/reproduction goal, because it's a pure reality-modelling goal: \"form a model of reality to predict this aspect of reality based on this other aspect\" and not \"form a model of reality in order to change it in some way\". Consider two hypothetical science departments: one is funded by a corporation that grants/withholds funding based on how the research contributes to the company's bottom line. Another is funded by a university with no profit motive: the catch being that the department can't directly do any research itself but formulates theories based on reading thousands of scientific journals in the university's library. The department's success is gauged by how well it can predict the newly published results of these scientists after reading their earlier work. The first is an analogy to natural selection, with the \"bottom line\" being reproductive success. The second is an LLM. Which one is more trustworthy? In practise, of course the LLMs are being developed by billion dollar corporations that very much do care about their bottom lines, and it seems unlikely that this motivation won't work it's way into an LLMs output somehow, but I'm just talking about the bias (if any) inherent in the next-token-prediction task.\n\n**Other Possible Parallels Between ID and AI Skepticism**\n\nOne parallel pointed out by many people is the \"AI of the gaps\" - the tendency of AI skeptics to move the goal posts when AI systems become capable of something that was previously considered the sole preserve of humans: they shift focus to the remaining things that AI can't do. This is likened to the \"God of the gaps\" - the way creationists claim that there is a gap in the fossil record between two fossils but when a new intermediate fossil is discovered simply claim there are now two gaps.\n\nAnother possible parallel is between theistic evolution and neuro-symbolic programming, which seeks to combine \"top-down\" symbolic reasoning with the bottom-up, emergent capabilities of deep learning. Critics like Gary Marcus argue that deep learning alone is insufficient for creating reliable, agentic intelligence, just as proponents of TE argue that natural selection alone is insufficient to account for the complexity of life. Theistic evolutionists posit that while natural selection has significant power to adapt organisms to their environments, it requires divine guidance to achieve the complexity we see in nature. Similarly, advocates of neuro-symbolic AI suggest that symbolic reasoning provides the \"top-down\" structure necessary to complement the emergent patterns discovered by neural networks. Both approaches aim to reconcile the perceived limits of purely emergent systems with the need for directed complexity. But this prompts the question: are those limits really there, or can bottom-up processes get there on their own given enough scale and time?\n\nCurrent AI systems have many limitations and the internal workings of how the models produce their outputs are still not well understood. It's therefore justified to be skeptical of some claims about their future capability. However, many skeptical arguments have similarities with intelligent design theories, and people who reject those theories should be cautious that they don't embrace the ideas underlying them in another context.",

      "title": "Effective altruism and the Selfish Gene",
      "content": "**Summary:**\n\nPeter Singer’s philosophy of Effective Altruism is justified by his Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests, which specifies that I should benefit everyone exactly alike, according to their needs, including myself, taking the “point of view of the universe”.\n\nThe Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests may be used to justify non-discrimination and justice, because the point of view of these must be impartial in order to work.  The same principle may not be used to justify altruism, because altruism is necessarily egocentric: I give to you, not “just anybody” gives to you.\n\nI have a moral responsibility (I am the object of a legitimate moral demand) to help needy strangers over the other side of the world.  But I don’t have an obligation to do so, because if I don't, nothing bad will happen to me.  By contrast, there is both a legitimate demand and an obligation for me to help myself, because if I don’t, bad things will happen to me.  So, it is important for me to help myself preferentially over a needy stranger over the other side of the world.\n\nWhy will bad things happen to me if I do not help myself preferentially over others?  The point is not that I \\*should\\* help myself preferentially, just that if I don’t, nobody else will, because they are necessarily too busy looking after themselves.\n\n>I have through all regions wandered;\n\n>Still have I none ever found\n\n>Who loved another more than himself.\n\n>So is one’s own self dearer than another,\n\n>Therefore out of love to one’s own self\n\n>Doth no-one injure another.\n\n>*The Buddha  (Narasu, 1993)*\n\n>... altruism becomes applied egotism.\n\n>*Narasu (1993)*\n\n>... dopamine-related neural pleasure centers in human brains are stimulated when someone acts generously or responds to a generous act.\n\n>*Sarah Blaffer Hrdy – “Mothers and Others – the evolutionary origins of mutual understanding”*\n\n>... we feel a “warm glow”, a pleasurable feeling, at improving the plight of others\n\n>*Frans de Waal – “The Age of Empathy”*\n\n>... is it right to spend money on entertaining ourselves when we could use it to help people living in extreme poverty?\n\n>*Singer (2011:vii)*\n\n**The principle of equal consideration of interests**\n\nPeter Singer bases his prescriptive theories of altruism and of non-discrimination on the Principle of Equal Consideration of Interests.  This principle is based on an argument from authority: lots of philosophers have espoused this principle, therefore it must be true.  The principle is best stated by utilitarians Jeremy Bentham and Henry Sidgwick, as “Each to count for one and none for more than one”; and “The good of any one individual is of no more importance, from the point of view (if I may say so) of the Universe, than the good of any other” respectively.\n\n>The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of an alleged actual equality among humans: it is a prescription of how we should treat humans.\n\n>Singer (1989:1)\n\n>... in making ethical judgments, we go beyond our own likes and dislikes.  From an ethical perspective, it is irrelevant that it is I who benefit from cheating you and you who lose by it.  Ethics goes beyond ‘I’ and ‘you’ to the universal law, the universalizable judgment, the standpoint of the impartial spectator or ideal observer, or whatever we choose to call it. ...\n\n>In accepting that ethical judgments must be made from a universal point of view, I am accepting that my own needs, wants and desires cannot, simply because they are my preferences, count more than the wants, needs and desires of anyone else.\n\n>Singer (2011:11)\n\n>So – to return to the situation of the finder of abundant fruit, who is deciding whether to share it with others – I might hold that I have a right to the fruit, because I found it.  Or I might claim that it is fair that I should get the fruit, because I did the hard work of finding the tree.  Alternatively, I could hold that everyone has an equal right to the abundance nature provides, and so I am required to share the fruit equally.\n\n>Singer (2011:13)\n\n>\n\n**Altruism and the principle of equal consideration**\n\nAltruism is necessarily ego-centred, because it is not “anybody” or “somebody” or “the universe” who is doing the giving.  It is me, myself and I.  Hence, the Principle of Equal Considerations cannot be used to justify altruism, because persons are not equal under altruism.  One is giving, the other is receiving.\n\n**Egocentric altruism**\n\nAll altruism is necessarily egocentric, because it is me who is doing the giving.  What my ego does for myself, it can also do for others.  In effect, I expand the limits of my ego’s operation to include the interests of others who need it or deserve it.  If I have benevolent intentions, then I will aim to benefit these others.  If I have selfish and/or malevolent intentions, then I will aim to exploit and/or harm these others.\n\nHumans have an evolved drive to help other humans in need, derived from their interdependence: if I depend on you, then if I help you, I am helping myself (Tomasello et al., 2012).  This is thought to have evolved in the ancient context of small bands of people living and surviving together, and so, evolutionarily, it only applies to people in my vicinity.  However, psychology is a flexible thing, and I am likely to feel empathic concern towards, and a desire to help, any human being in need.\n\nGiven that I need to prefer myself, but also that I have an altruistic desire to benefit and not harm others: each person affected by my action is to receive the maximum benefit and minimum harm available to them.  I call this formula, “Perfect Compassion”.\n\n[Diagram of Perfect Compassion: egocentric altruism](https://orangebud.co.uk/Perfect_Compassion.PNG)\n\n**Circles of concern**\n\nWhat is “available” for me to give someone else varies according to how close they are to me in “circles of concern”.  According to this scheme, I am likely to give more to those I depend on the most and am genetically related to the most, because doing this positively impacts my own fitness in some way, whether directly for myself, or indirectly, for my genetic relatives and those I depend on.\n\n**Justice, non-discrimination, and the principle of equal consideration**\n\nSinger is correct to apply the “point of view of the universe” to the question of discrimination based on identity, since this is ultimately a matter of justice – of treating people impartially.\n\nJustice or fairness could be defined as giving each person concerned an equal unit of benefit (or harm) per unit of deservingness or need, which has to be judged impartially, without fear or favour or self-preference\n\nWe all have the same need – the need to thrive and survive to the maximum possible extent.  Therefore we are all vulnerable to our needs not being met (Andorno and Boffone, 2014): we are all vulnerable to being vulnerable.  If someone is struggling, and their basic needs are not being met, but I am flourishing – I am flourishing, but they are not.  To restore mutual benefit, I could perform an act of altruism towards them.\n\nThe \"should\" of non-discrimination and universal human rights is ultimately the \"should\" of human compassion, that is founded on human interdependence.\n\n**Responsibility and obligation – the carrot and the stick**\n\nObligation comes in two parts: legitimate demand (responsibility), and forceful bindingness (which makes the responsibility an obligation).\n\nResponsibility is a legitimate demand whose legitimacy motivates us to live up to it; obligation is something we must do and cannot get out of.  Thereby I have a responsibility to help needy strangers over the other side of the world: I should do it.  But I must help myself and those close to me.\n\n**References**\n\nAndorno, Roberto; Cristiana Baffone – “Human Rights and the Moral Obligation to Alleviate Suffering”; in Ronald Green and Nathan Palpant (eds.), Suffering and bioethics, New York, Oxford University Press, p. 182-200, 2014\n\nNarasu, P Lakshmi – “The Essence of Buddhism”; Asian Educational Services, New Delhi, Madras; 1993\n\nSinger, Peter – “All Animals are Equal”; in Tom Regan & Peter Singer (eds.), Animal Rights and Human Obligations, pp. 148-162; New Jersey: Prentice-Hall; 1989\n\nSinger, Peter – “Practical Ethics – 3rd edition”; Cambridge University Press, 2011\n\nTomasello, Michael; Alicia P Melis; Claudio Tennie; Emily Wyman; Esther Herrmann – “Two Key Steps in the Evolution of Human Cooperation – The Interdependence Hypothesis” – Current Anthropology, vol. 53, no. 6, Dec 2012",

      "title": "Dolorem Ipsum -- Filling space with my praise for the work of Cicero -- De finibus bonorum et malorum (\"On the ends of good and evil\")",
      "content": "For most people, ***Lorem ipsum*** [is simply a filler text for graphic artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum) used to test the formatting of their work in progress.\n\nIt's where I first found Cicero's book. I was curious what that text actually meant, and looked it up. \n\nIf you are able to read the Latin or grab a translation, the section that begins with Dolorem Ipsum, \"Pain Itself,\" is a profound concept, and an indictment of praising either pain or pleasure as any kind of final moral ideal in life.\n\nThe section goes, in English, according to Harris Rackham in 1914:\n\n>\"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose. To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?  \n  \n\"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.\"\n\nAccording to Cicero's [\"On the Ends of Good and Evil,\"](https://archive.org/details/cicerosfivebooks00cice/page/n5/mode/2up) otherwise called \"On the Ends, Concerning the Last Object, Desire and Aversion,\" *(the title is just the beginning of centuries of localization headaches)* there are three fundamental states of life:\n\n\\- Pleasure in the absence of pain.  \n\\- Pain in the absence of pleasure.   \n\\- A mix of pleasure and pain. \n\n*These are delivered more as a criticism of various philosophies than as a dogma of its own. Keep that in mind.*\n\nPain of course isn't the pain we feel when picked by a needle. It is, in a way, that kind of pain included, but instead it is more of a kind of Revulsion, or Misery, or Suffering. The kind of abject discomfort and discontent that arises from bad circumstances, the kind which we find ourselves in when we're being punished by an authority for bad behavior, or the simple fateful ramifications of our own maligned stupidity.\n\nPleasure also isn't some orgasmic sensory goodness, from sex or food or a gentle caress. Well, *it is*, but it is also the joy of living. It is freedom from oppression, from misery brought on by not understanding the cause of our suffering, the kind we endure when we have a bad back due to not following the recommendations to lift with your legs instead of your spine. It's avoiding the miserable marriage, or a job we hate, and instead living free from such agony.\n\nI'd posit a fourth, being \"true neutral,\" to complete the quadrants of a kind of Pain, Pleasure, Absence graph. *(But how much an absence of sensation is itself possible outside of contrast with the other two is itself a dive into the realm of* [*Democritus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Void_(philosophy))*, and neuroscience, and is outside the scope of this post.)*\n\nThe is delivered as a criticism of aponia, the Epicurean concept of living free from pain, being the highest moral aim. But this idea of a kind of unavoidable return to this duality isn't lost in dismissal -- instead of the *measurements* being thrown out, it's the *conclusions* of the philosophy he's wrestling with.  \n\nWe can then begin to look at our daily lives and assess, \"what brings the most joy, to myself and those near me which reflect upon me, and what diminishes the most pain the same way? And what of these actions do I benefit from immediately, and what over the long term?\"\n\nThis isn't merely an encouragement for absolute narcissism. It's not a joyous romp for wealthy men luxuriating in their high villas free from the daily torment of involuntary labor. If anything, this philosophy sees the Individual and the World as a united pair, each interrogating one another, seeing answers to the difficult question of, \"by what mechanism is the greatest good achieved and the worst miseries are diminished?\"\n\nHow much pain can you live with while pursuing joy? \n\nThere is a medical answer to that question. \n\nThere is a scientific answer to that question. \n\nThere is a purely subjective opinion answer to that question. \n\nThere is a political answer as to how much you're willing to shift from yourself onto others.\n\nUltimately, as the book continues, we are reminded that the questioner is not the arbiter of the ultimate answer. Life reveals to us what is true by what happens, not by what we intended to happen, or what we want to happen, but by what actually happens. We're left spinning, trying to understand the truth as these events unfold, with or without our deserving them or desiring them.\n\nThe goal in life is not merely to reduce pain to zero and live in bliss. Nor is it to live in overwhelming suffering, embracing misery, and treating pleasure as a fancy unfit for a wise being living in eternal penance for our alleged sins.   \n  \nInstead life is formed of the interplay of pain and pleasure, desire and revulsion, treating them each with honesty and nonjudgmental curiosity.\n\nJust as the Stoic founder Zeno would say, and as Nietzsche would say as Amor Fati, \"Loving One's Fate,\" we're left to live in a reality that doesn't ask if we want to experience this or not, but it becomes endemic upon us not to merely tolerate living, but to embrace it. In Nietzsche's case that means truly loving it. In Zeno's, it's about questioning it deeply. Together the two philosopher separated by millennia are in agreement. \n\nIf we judge pain as being evil and only worthy of being abolished, what have we learned from the lessons pain can teach?   \n  \nWe know in the 21st Century that [Congenital Insensitivity to Pain and Anhydrosis (CIPA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain) is a debilitating genetic disease, the consequences of which can't be understated. Children cutting teeth bite their own lips and tongues off, receive mortal wounds and don't notice, live with broken or amputated limbs and are the unfortunate victim of the universe's revelation that *pain itself isn't the sole cause or origin of suffering*. \n\nThe same can be found true in pleasure.   \n  \nIf there were ever such a true thing as pure unadulterated pleasure, it is probably the finally moments one feels suffering [dopamine ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine)and [serotonin shock syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serotonin_syndrome) together while rolling on MDMA and having a continuous involuntary orgasm. It's a profound pleasure so intense it is actually agony. Because these chemicals are also regulating breathing, bowel movements, and a myriad of other complex organ functions besides the sensations themselves, there is no such thing as \"pure pleasure,\" so much as \"flipping all the switches of the nervous system to maximum\" at once.\n\nNo one living in the 21st Century needs a reminder that [chasing the dragon of pure pleasure leads to horrific suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin#History). Substance Abuse may be the clearest example, seen here as pursuing pleasure without understanding the nature of its miserable consequences. Misunderstanding dosage, and misunderstanding the value of enjoyment over the devastation of involuntary long term use, are the kind of misunderstandings that only comprehension through experimentation can bring, but at what cost is that wisdom earned?\n\nCicero in the first century of Rome had, of course, no access to this neurochemistry research. But for his purpose and messaging, he didn't need it.\n\nCicero was calling for an indictment of any philosophy that praises suffering as a high moral aim, such as the hyper puritanical martyr faiths penitent of his day, while also insisting on a dialogue between the core hypothesizes of [Epicureanism ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epicureanism)and [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism). By letting the two fight it out in 5 books laying out their defenses, praise, and then viciously attacking each one, we're left at the end wondering, \"which of these philosophical approaches to life is really the best answer to the meaning of human happiness and the cause of wisdom?\" \n\nThis is an encouragement for the reader to take their own interpretation of what is good and just, and what is not, and come to their own conclusions on how to live. To continue the dialogue not as a matter of fact, but a suggestion towards a continuing journey towards the truth. \n\nThis isn't a work of dogma. It is inherently a document of questions, interrogating itself, and encouraging you to do the same. ***All in a section of text typically used simply to fill an empty space with incomprehensible letters.*** \n\nIt's difficult to accept that the course of wisdom may not be for everyone, because the clarity of its communication is so obscure only experts can decipher it.   \n  \nIt's unfair that this text is seen as stuffy academic pretension, locked away in an expensive high tower. \n\nIt is a message for daily life, for everyone.   \n  \nTaking The Man at his word is a straight path to tyranny. It's obvious that not trusting an autocratic dictator, and forging your own line of inquiry, is the path out of ignorance. Combating ignorance means not even taking yourself at your own word, not accepting that what you believe is true is undoubtedly true, least you risk becoming a tyrant unto yourself!   \n  \nI can't think of a more relevant message for people living in the 21st Century, the so called \"Information Age,\" where our knowledge has left us on the cusp of an artificial intelligence revolution, where there is not yet an *artificial wisdom* to temper it from making the *Holocene* an apocalypse of certain uncertainties.   \n  \nThe tyrant, that tyrant internal and external to the self, demands we stay in the safety of ignorance, and never leave, without evidence or justification why. But what if the path away from tyranny includes information that we are not privy to that leads to our immanent deaths? Like a parent preventing a toddler from walking off a ledge. Are we not a tyrant equally justified in imposing our unquestionable will upon the unwilling?\n\nDo we trust the tyrant is benevolent, or do we question the tyrant as unjust, risking our own doom? \n\nHow do we determine if an expert in a field we are not experts in, is giving us reliable and good information to help us, or if they are lying to us and using our ignorance as leverage in dominating our lives unjustly?  \n  \nWe're all beginners in the beginning. If the nativity of our curiosity is the end, there are no wise elders.\n\nSo what are we to do about the problem of blind obedience to an authority whose expert role we don't understand? \n\nThe core conceit that I find myself coming back to again and again throughout my life, the conceit that informed my own answer to the ultimate question of the human experience, is to embrace wonder. This split between joy and misery, which I came to after reading this work as a teenager, again in my twenties, and again in my 30s, has grown with me. Through my own journey of being naive, not knowing enough to make a truly informed decision, to trying and failing to find what it means to understand the mechanism of happiness and misery -- it's simply to deliver a better message that people can understand early and often without friction:\n\n*Embrace wonder. Ask the question. Try, and fail, in absence of certainty.* *Record what you learn, and keep revealing the next moment of life.* \n\nIf no other sentence in any work ever written survived, if that one string of text was available to us all, then it would begin to write new works again, immediately. Wonder drives the curiosity to seek answers and try again. It is a faithless faith. The one belief that requires no confidence or certainty to justify holding it dearly, because if it gives up and quits, so too does the total endeavor of human insight. \n\nJust as Cicero concludes his book by criticizing his own chosen Platonism, not because it is right, but because he's comfortable ending on that note as the path of truth for him, I am comfortable leaving my own reproducible gibberish only with the reservation that it, too, be questioned fiercely. \n\nIt is not the saying that something is true that makes it true. It is the revealing of what is possible. Part of that is an ongoing dialogue. Some of it painful, in the honest hope that it reveals greater joy having done so.\n\nThere is no guarantee that any of us ever come to a right or correct conclusion, because there clearly isn't one. And if there is, it is wrapped tightly in the death grip of fate itself.\n\nBut to wonder for wonder's sake, to seek answers to what brings misery and what cures it joyfully, that itself is the question that motivates all answers. \n\n",

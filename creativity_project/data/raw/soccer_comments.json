I don't mean as a criticism, he solves a puzzle piece for arsenal, just not sure if warranted that price.\n\nIn my limited viewing, I like caicedo in that price range than Rice. Caicedo is a harder to replicate player in my opinion.",

I do remember thinking his time there ended too soon, but his prime years were in the Premier League. Still, he bagged so many goals and a CL title after missing out with Arsenal. \n\nGiven I was a teenager in his prime and he was making the Premier League look EASY, he will always be my favourite player. Also that night against Inter in the CL where Arsenal went to the San Siro and wiped them 5-1, it's forever etched in my memory. In my view that Invincibles side could have done better in the CL, but I believe that was the year they dropped points to Celta Vigo (lol) and lost to Bayern?",

Then once in the stadium and the second line of checks by stadium staff I made a funny gay joke so they weren't exactly thorough and the bottle of water now in the back of my pants went undetected. I'm glad I did it because once in it was 30 minutes minimum to get 300ml in a carton which was crap.\n\nLike these guys getting in. If you are cheeky enough, confident enough and acutely aware of your surroundings it's amazing what you can actually get away with.\n\nSadly though whilst Istanbul was a challenge it's worrying places like Wembley and the Etihad are ridiculously easy to take stuff into.

The 18-year-old can break the league transfer record.**\n\nThis is absolutely sensational news and it's hard to believe! Although a few days ago we reported HERE about the great interest of Ede from Premier League clubs and other top teams from the TOP 5 leagues in Europe, we did not expect such a development. The matter is getting really serious.\n \nAccording to our information, Chelsea are very determined to acquire the teenage defender and want to close the topic quickly due to the wide interest in the player - including their direct competition.\n\nAs we have established, direct talks between the English and Motor began on the occasion of the Conference League final in Wroc≈Çaw (28 May), won by \"The Blues\", and these are by no means inquiries about the player, but transfer negotiations regarding the amount and conditions of his acquisition. The parties met in one of the hotels in the capital of Lower Silesia.\n\nWe hear that the club from Stamford Bridge is to send an offer for him in the coming days, and the matter will be settled in June. Although it sounds abstract, because Ede has played only six matches in the Ekstraklasa, the transfer amount may be record-breaking and break the barrier of 11 million euros.\n\nWhat is it all about and where do such numbers come from? The Pole is considered to be the so-called \"wonderkid\" - a great talent - if only because of his physical and motor conditions and playing with his left foot. Experience is absolutely irrelevant here. The price is driven up by potential.\n\nIf the transfer goes through, will Ede go straight to Chelsea? From what we hear, the club already has a specific plan for him. The 18-year-old would first go to Strasbourg, which is owned by BlueCo - a consortium managed by Todd Boehly and Behdad Eghali.\n\nThe French club has the youngest squad (average age 22.1) of all the strongest leagues in Europe and this is where Ede would develop. If he made the progress he had, the next stop would be England.\n\nThe words of the owner of Motor, Zbigniew Jakubas, spoken on our air during the Football Gala, about Ede's great talent and future may therefore be prophetic and come true sooner than anyone expected.\n\nIn a moment, it may turn out that the Polish billionaire can also earn great money on football. The price for Ede would be gigantic. Motor brought him in the winter from Zag≈Çƒôbie Lubin for 100 thousand euros, and the \"Coppers\" did not even save a percentage of the next sale.\n\nBright Ede has played six games at the level of PKO BP Ekstraklasa so far. He scored one goal - in his debut against Stal Mielec.",

Reactive dribbling - He would often feint and wait for the opponent to make a wrong move, which works for sure but as we have seen with Sancho it does not achieve much if the defender is then able to use their pace to recover,which brings me on to the second issue\n\n2. He just wasn't fast enough, and the truth is that these days it is hard for wingers to thrive if they are slow - The days of Mata and Figo are more or less done because statistics are domianted by wingers with pace like Vini and Mbappe. \n\n3. Laziness - Dude ran way less than Mbappe off the ball, and that as a teenager. Sure does work if you are prime Ronaldo and can score 50 per season, but Cherki is never going to be that big of a G+A merchant.\n\n  \nHowever folks say he runs way more these days and even helps out in defence - So maybe Pep has noticed that. \n\nStill do not think he is the second coming of Zidane.",

From the age of 12 upwards, possibly all the way to that doomed United move, there was no player in European football as highly rated as Sancho in his age group.\n\n>But either the curse of United has struck Sancho, or the demands of the club were simply beyond him. Twice United have tried to get rid of him and twice, most recently with Chelsea, he has come back. This summer he represents just one more problem for United in a window in which circumstances demand they must sell or re-loan at least four forward players.\n\n>Marcus Rashford, Antony, Alejandro Garnacho and now Sancho ‚Äì back from his second loan away from United, this time at Chelsea. Both sides see the outcome of the Chelsea adventure differently. For United, the ¬£5 million penalty for Chelsea to release them from their obligation to buy Sancho covers part of his wages in this, his final contracted year. Chelsea will argue the deal made sense for them then and now.\n\n>Sancho‚Äôs time at Chelsea last season was by no means a bust. There were some good performances in his 41 appearances, and a goal in the final of the Europa Conference League last month, when he came on as a substitute. The problem for a player who was once regarded as one of his kind is that, at his age, and his cost, there are plenty of alternatives.\n\n>Four years ago, there was only Sancho on his level ‚Äì aged 21 and brought to the Premier League by United as the best player of the English turn-of-the-millennium generation. He was the first footballer born in the 21st century to be named in an England squad. Restless as a junior player, he left Watford when Manchester City ‚Äì the most successful academy of the era ‚Äì came calling. Then he left again when City could not guarantee first-team football. He departed for Dortmund, cutting a path that others have followed, and it has not bothered him whom he upset along the way.",

I just wish Anselmi stopped with the bullshit of locking the wingers/AMs to the center at all times, because a lot of times it makes it hard on the fullbacks to progress the ball when the center is cut off or you don't have players in the middle that know how to give passing lines or don't have the vision to thread the needle like it is the case.",

According to the information collected by Record, this is an agreement that satisfies the blue and white officials, both for the trust placed in the Spanish‚Äôs capabilities and for the fact that a very hard negotiation process is concluded with Al Ahli Jeddah which, as we realized at an appropriate time, required 24 million euros after its initial approach FC Porto points to 14 million.\n\n> Thus confirmed the return of the 23-year-old to European football, two years after he left Celta Vigo for Saudi Arabia, in a transfer that, at the time, surprised European football. Now in Invicta, the medium will have a contract valid for five seasons, until June 2030.\n\n> Veiga will thus be entered in the special transfer window opened by FIFA, so he is eligible to participate in the Club World Cup. The Spaniard was delighted with the project presented to him by FC Porto and the proximity of his home region, Galicia, also had a certain weight in the fact that he wanted to head to the Dragon. In addition, the medium has everything to be well informed about the blue and white reality. After all, he has been from Galeno‚Äôs teammate since January and knows Samu and Nico Gonz√°lez well of the young teams of Spain.",

He scored 17 goals in 33 competitive matches (Bundesliga & cup) for VfB last season. He also contributed three assists. He is technically strong, but his height (1.98 m) also makes him a dangerous header.\n\n> Nagelsmann praised him on Tuesday evening: \"Nick made a good impression, he's a good guy. I've heard a lot of positive things from Sebastian Hoene√ü, also from his time at Bremen. And I can only confirm that. He's a pleasant player to deal with and also within the team. From the feedback he has given me, he has been well received and is also quite well received. He also has a good goal threat and is good in front of goal. After the season, he should also have self-confidence.\"\n\n> It remains to be seen whether Woltemade will be preferred to his buddy Niclas F√ºllkrug or whether both will start. Nagelsmann on Friday: \"They are different types of striker, we haven't decided 100 percent yet who will start. Maybe we'll start with both of them, that's also possible.\"",

Apparently last summer we had a full agreement with the player but didn't execute the transfer because of lack of PSR head room to get it done and then he went on to have quite a good season in the championship. He fits a bunch of our transfer checklist items because he is young, homegrown and highly rated.\n\nIn terms of why sign a new keeper when we have Pope and Dubravka. Pope has done his shoulder 2 years running and been out for a long time. Dubravka has never been perfect either but has always been a solid choice. In terms of what specifically we would want in a keeper is just being better with his feet while still being a good shot stopper is all we really want because Pope is a proper liability with his feet and an average keeper overall except for his catching crosses and speed of throws for counter attacks. \n\nPope is linked with Leeds. Dubravka is probably going to be backup keeper. We are looking at Forester too as a 3rd choice instead of Gillespie/Ode/Ruddy with Ruddy 100% out and Ode either getting transferred out or loan with obligation since he is definitely not wanted here.",

Outside football Canonico is a businessman in the construction sector and regularly works with public institutions and he cannot have (even less than normal, that is to say zero) the slightest connection to people in the mafia.\n\n\nThese are the main episodes, perpetrated by a certain Lombardi in connection with at least three other people. Canonico met Lombardi when he bought the team as he showed up with the former general director of Foggia. Lombardi then got into a relationship with a Foggia employee and showed up unannounced at the stadium. He also tried to get a job there through a friend. Canonico kicked him out and fired his girlfriend. Afterwards this happened, no-one went to the police to point this out:\n\n\n1) in June 2023, shots were fired with a shotgun against the car of Foggia's captain Davide di Pasquale;\n\n\n2) in November 2023 he burns down the car of defender Alessandro Garattoni, who asks to be sold and goes to Virtus Entella;\n\n\n3) Five days later he burns down the car of one of the main ultras as he is against Lombardi. In return, this ultra burns down the car of Lombardi's girlfriend. In retaliation, together with another criminal, Lombardi burns down the car of another ultra;\n\n\n4) In January 2024 Foggia's vice-president, and Canonico's son, finds a kilo of explosive next to his car, which was parked in his father's company;\n\n\n5) in February 2024, Lombardi passes off as Foggia's CEO, activates three fuel cards at Q8 and pays 4800‚Ç¨ of fuel. When Q8 asks for the money Foggia doesn't pay nor do they file a lawsuit.\n\n\n6) in March 2024 the police randomly intercept a minor who is emptying a fuel canister on the car of the secretary of Foggia.\n\n\n7) The same thing as number 6 happens the next day to the director general Vincenzo Milillo. He is criminally charged afterwards as he is very reticent in his replies.",

Don't really like him but I don't think he's ever been the spiteful type. \n\nMaybe if he was in Thuram's position and came off of a final loss, then yeah there's a reason to be fuming inside.",

The club said they wouldn't be willing to sell me, only if I wanted to leave, that it wasn't a financial question. It was a very ambitious proposal. The president was a spectacular person, we never spoke about values [initially]. With my manager, of course. Then I spoke to my wife as a family and she asked me what my personal career goals were. She was always very supportive. It was an easy move, even on a family level... I had Jo√£o Cancelo there, my children are used to playing with him in the national team... There's a great friendship.

I want to do it after a defeat like this to tell all the Inter fans that I'm sorry.\n\n\nI'm sorry for the defeat and how it came, because we were one step away from a dream and we couldn't make it happen.\n\nI wanted to make you happy and I couldn't. But don't think that this thing doesn't weigh me on. I feel this suffering inside me.\n\nI feel the exact same feelings as you. Disalusion, anger, frustration. I feel sorry for all of you who sacrificed time and money to be there, but also for all those who couldn't come and would have wanted to. I'm sorry because I'm one of you in good, but even more in bad.\n\nI wasn't the best version of myself. I don't want to hide or pretend nothing happened. I made many sacrifices to get to this moment and on the most beautiful I couldn't be your usual Federico. I'm sorry if I wasn't able to protect our dream. From now on I will have this scar. He will never leave, but he will always remind me that loving a team unconditionally means that too.\n\nRejoicing for victories, suffer tremendously for defeats.\n\nBut doing it all together will help us overcome even this terrible feeling. And one day we will rejoice again. This is the beauty of being an Inter star. For good and for worse, but together!\n\nCome on Inter, today more than ever!\n\nFrederick",

But the former Italian footballer, now 64, also endured a traumatic childhood, which he recounts in a book titled **\"The Fate of a Striker\"** ‚Äî the story of how, at the age of 14, he lost his mother at the hands of his father.\n\n> **\"My mother never reported him because she was afraid something would happen to us, the children,\"** recalls Carnevale in an interview with *Corriere della Sera*. **\"My father was extremely jealous, there was a climate of terror at home. I was there when she was slapped, beaten. There were insults. Until that morning, September 25, 1975: he woke up and grabbed an axe. He found my mother washing clothes in the river near our house. And he killed her. I ran there, took the bloodstained axe, and brought it to the police,\"** remembers the former striker, who now works as a scout for Udinese.\n\n> Carnevale was just 14 when it happened. Two years later, he went to visit his father in prison. **\"I was 16. I wanted to look him in the eyes. He had taken everything from me. But I saw him ‚Äî and I hugged him. Tightly. In some way, I forgave him, knowing I was facing a very sick man. For many years I lived with pain, but also with the fear that I would become like him. But no, I'm not like him. I understood that when I saw him. And that was the first step toward liberation.\"**\n\n> The former international footballer came to understand the illness. **\"He was schizophrenic, never treated. Some years later, he took his own life by jumping out of a window ‚Äî right in front of me.\"**\n\n> Having gone through all of this at such a young age, Carnevale decided to write a book dedicated to victims. **\"I know families who were left orphaned ‚Äî the victims. I told everything and I wrote it for them. The blood trail never ends, and I become that unhappy child again every time I hear one of these stories.\"**\n\n> To his daughters and to women in general, he leaves a warning: **\"The first time your husband or boyfriend ‚Äî whoever he is ‚Äî raises his hand or shouts at you, leave him. He will do it again, for sure. Report it. I did it back then, but it didn‚Äôt help. Today I work with institutions. I want to be on the front line. Report it!\"**",

With a number of clubs in Europe and the USA interested in his services, the former Le Havre man has been sent to so many squads that rumours have often drowned out the real intentions of interested clubs. Back in April, reports emanating from Germany explained that Paul Pogba had targeted five ideal destinations for his future.\n\nOne of these was Ligue 1. Having never played in the French top flight, Paul Pogba has often been linked with OM in recent months. Having made no secret of his attachment to the Canebi√®re outfit, Pogba is unlikely to join the V√©lodrome this summer, despite the fact that his hefty salary would be a considerable obstacle for the Marseille outfit. However, according to our information, the 32-year-old midfielder has been offered to AS Monaco. In their search for a talented player to bolster their midfield, the Rocher outfit have been offered the 2018 world champion. It remains to be seen whether ASM will wish to go further in recruiting a player who could bring many things to the Monegasques if he returns to his former level.",

The sporting results honestly are being overrated compared to the financial stability he's been able to provide, by achieving successful seasons with decreasing budgets year over year.\n\n\nFabregas is exciting and risky. Clearly the management wants someone who's most likely going to request less expensive players but with higher potential, and considering the youth team in the works, someone that can develop them better. Also, a totally different play style with more possession and less wing back play. Other than Napoli, all of the other top teams are rebuilding, so it's going to be an interesting season how all of them progress and if Napoli can keep up with a tighter schedule the upcoming season.",

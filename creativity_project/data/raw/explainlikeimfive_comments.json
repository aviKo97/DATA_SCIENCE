It's obviously more complicated than that, but that's a good place to start at least. \n\nRabies is very deadly to humans, but it's also incredibly uncommon for it to be spread between humans. A human can get infected by a rabid animal bite, but it would take pretty extreme conditions for a human to pass it on to another human. What's much more likely is that a human gets rabies from an animal and then just dies. It spreads through saliva during its contagious phase, but humans are pretty good at not getting bit by other humans, especially when they've been sick and acting weird for a while. \n\nBubonic plague and TB are a bit different since they're caused by bacteria and not viruses, but plague was spread by flea bites, which, in the middle ages, getting bit by a flea without realizing it was much easier and more common than being bit by a rabid animal or human, and TB doesn't always cause active infection in people that have it. That's why any time you go places with a bunch of people living in close quarters like prison or a college dorm you get tested for TB, it's very possible to have it without ever having any symptoms.",

And you seem to misunderstand the behavioral modifications. The animal doesn't become a bloodthirsty killing machine; their brain is rotting so they're dazed and confused and irritated, staggering around until they die. And macro-animals are never particularly good at spreading disease. The Black Plague was spread by fleas and malaria is spread by mosquitos. Rabies is spread by large easily avoidable mammals that aren't able to move properly, clearly have something wrong with them, and that die shortly after symptoms start. I've never heard of any sort of insects transmitting the disease. And it dies pretty quickly after the creature's death, meaning it can't infect other creatures as a water-borne or airborne pathogen.\n\nTL;DR: A virus spread by water, air, or unnoticeable insects has a much easier time spreading than one that relies on a delirious coyote with an expiration date.",

        "body": "Rabies is transmitted, primarily, through bites and scratches. Rabies however doesnt turn you into a killer zombie. So in animals that were to get it, let's say a dog that was bitten by a bat that had it.  Assuming that dog is in the woods, it may never come across another living being in the time it takes the rabies to descend into the neurological symptoms. Let's say it does come across another living being, it may infect that being but that being very well could also die before they met another to infect. If that dog had an owner, im pretty certain they would have killed the dog so no more bites or scratches.\n\nLet's say it's a lion in a pack. It's symptoms MIGHT cause it to infect the others if its aggressive. But I would say the more likely thing that would happen is that it would simply display signs of its descent and the pack would distance themselves from it. Like how they leave the elderly lions if they slow down too much.\n\nNow for humans. We haven't exactly had a pleasant history with dealing with sick people. Lepers for example were generally shunned and left to their own devices. I would put money that should that owner of that dog have gotten bit, assuming he even had a family to notice the symptoms, most people would have distanced themselves from him. If he was lucky enough to have a family then he'd at least died being cared for. But we arent zombies. We, as humans, dont typically go around biting each other. Aggression like that isnt usually present. \n\nSo in all cases, the dog that bit the owner, the dog that bit the other animal, or the dog not biting anyone, and the lion that fell behind because of the neurological deficiencies, the end result is usually no one was around them when they passed, considering how big this world was and how sparce our populations were. Except for the family man, he probably had care but likely didnt bite or scratch someone. \n\nThere are other factors I'm sure but this is one aspect.\n\nTL;DR We used to shun the sick so humans would likely be left to their deaths unless you had a family. If you were an animal there is a likely hood that you didn't meet another animal to bite, and if you they did then there is a high likely hood they may not meet another. Dogs and cats were killed if they became aggressive.",

But if you have one baby you can invest more in it.\n\n So things with shorter life cycles tend to have more babies cause they don't have time to gamble with all of their eggs in one basket.\n\n But it also comes down to logistics of protecting those young. Deer usually only have 1 or 2 babies. This is cause they have a hard time keeping their offspring safe, so they need to be highly developed before being born so that they can be born and immediately start avoiding predators. Newborn fawns can walk immediately when born and learn to run within days. Having a more developed offspring is more expensive and a bigger baby is harder to birth, so it just doesn't work. A deer couldn't fit a litter of six fawns inside them and giving birth to them would kill them. Which doesn't work very well for mammals that need to feed their young milk.\n\n Wolves don't have this problem though. They don't have any predators under normal circumstances, they can dig burrows where their young are protected from the elements and from predators, and they are dangerous enough that they can fight off threats. This means it's OK for them if their babies are entirely defenseless for weeks. So they can be born early and grow outside the womb, letting wolves have bigger litters with less risk or cost to the mother. A mother that can then more quickly get back to hunting and get food. Wolves live long enough, are social, and coordinated enough that having a single or couple of babies would be enough, but they can easily get away with having big litters. So they do cause then they pass on more genes. If food is scarce a few of them might die, but there wasn't a big investment so that's fine and if food is plentiful they can pass on their genes quickly.\n\n So animals that can burrow or climb to hide away their young will also have more babies that are less developed, and animals that have to live in open, accessible areas need more developed young for them to survive, which causes fewer babies.\n\n For humans we have all the capacity to protect our young at this point, so they can be born defenseless and underdeveloped, so we could have plenty... But we also kind of suck at giving birth because our upright posture, so we have to settle for one entirely useless baby.",

The router remembers who asked and sends that request out to the internet. When the answer comes back, the router looks at the address on it and sends the data to the right device. It’s like putting your name on a letter so when the reply comes, the mailman knows exactly who it’s for.",

For this reason, large banks do not need to attract deposits as much as small banks.\n\nWhen you don't need to attract deposits, you can afford to offer a less attractive interest rate. For small community banks, individual deposits make up a much larger size of their financial holdings. You will typically get better savings rates from small local banks, than from larger national banks.\n\nIf you want to earn an interest rate closer to the short term Treasury rate you would usually deposit into a CD, money market account or purchase a Treasury backed security.

This usually ignores the amount of sleep you've got. Unless you're severely sleep-deprived, your body will want to wake you up at the same time, even if you went to bed late.\n\nIf we're lucky, that time coincides with when we need to get up. But sometimes even if we set alarms to wake ourselves at a certain time, our internal clocks just want to wake us at a different time. Consistency can help reset your internal clock (so sleeping late on weekends actually messes with that), but it can't always change it.\n\nIf you've ever heard a parent talk about their young child always waking up at 5 AM, regardless of when they were put down to sleep, that's why. The child's clock is programmed to wake at that time.\n\nIt's also why teens always seem to be night owls and do bad with morning classes. Their internal clock tells them the perfect time to wake up is noon (or much much later than they need to get up for school), and it's very very hard to train it otherwise. Many kids try to be good and get enough sleep, but still fall asleep at school because they're fighting their biology.\n\nAnimals have this internal clock, too.

It's not unreasonable to think that this is at least partially responsible for the huge number of peanut allergies specifically. \n\n\nFor allergies in general, there are a few hypotheses of how they can be triggered. The hygiene hypothesis is popular but not completely proven. There is also the theory that being exposed to allergens the \"wrong way\" the first time can help sensitize people - e.g. getting peanut butter on your hand as a baby well before you ever ingest it. Additionally there is a theory that many of the common allergens are associated with toxic substances. For example, it's decently common for peanuts to be contaminated ever so slightly with fungal toxins. It's not enough to impact a health adult, but maybe if a baby's first exposure to peanuts is one that was contaminated, then that triggers the immune system to say \"peanuts = poison\". We really don't know for sure.",

This is/was often advised by doctors in case the child is allergic. But not being introduced as early can cause a higher chance of developing the allergy itself. So this one is a bit of a spiral.\n\nTwo, basic hygiene in general as a society. Things are much \"cleaner\" now than they used to be, and children are being exposed to less various pathogens and infections. This makes it harder for the immune system to develop and know \"good\" vs \"bad\" as early. So sometimes it goes into overdrive, especially with foods it hasn't seen before (see point one).",

Scientists haven't fully agreed on why yet, though the leading idea is called the \"hygiene hypothesis\" - that our society is too clean, we don't get exposed to things for our immune system to fight off, and so the immune system starts to overreact to other things. A slow introduction of peanuts at young ages (under medical supervision) seems to help with peanut allergies. \n\n\nHowever, peanuts aren't banned from school because a lot more people are allergic to them - the increase might be as big as tripling but estimates still range from 1% to 3%. When I was a kid (and peanuts were allowed), it was still 1% ish.\n\n\nThe biggest reason is that peanuts are the allergen you are least likely to grow out of on your own (a lot of early childhood allergies disappear, peanuts are 80%+ likely to continue into adulthood) and also the most likely to cause anaphylaxis in response. Having recognized that and that it was killing kids at school who were sharing food, banning peanuts made sense. Other allergens are either not typically present at school (like shellfish), not as likely to cause anaphylaxis, and/or generally most kids have phased out of by elementary school. So peanuts  got the special treatment of being banned.",

To answer your question, first, the stenographer, or court reporter (\"CR\"), does record what is said in the courtroom for his/her reference. Very few court reporters make a real-time transcript anymore. What they are typing in the courtroom can be considered a rough draft. of the transcript, but the CR then goes back and reviews what they typed and compares it to the recording.\n\nThe benefit of using a CR rather than recording audio and then having someone who was not present transcribe it (or using speech recognition software) is that the CR can ask for clarification when someone says either a strange, uncommon term. (It may surprise you to learn some lawyers like using big, complicated words rather than a simpler word that conveys the same idea (this should be read with sarcasm)) or mumbles so that what they said is not clear at all. In my area, many of our courthouses have terrible acoustics (they are on the state register of historic places and cannot be modified to correct the acoustics). So the CR sometimes needs to tell lawyers to speak up, slow down, or repeat what they just said so that a good record can be made rather than a transcript that is full of \"\\[inaudible\\].\"\n\nIt's my understanding that many of the federal courts did go to an automated recording system, but when transcripts were needed, there was far too many errors and \"inaudibles\" in the transcript. They eventually got rid of that system and rehired court reporters.",

The stenographer makes all this explicit so there's no confusion down the line.\n\nThe stenographer also helps during the proceedings. The lawyers or judge can ask them to go back and read out what was said previously in the trial. Or they can be asked to strike certain things from the record. It would be a lot more difficult to do all this in real time with audio.\n\nFinally, it depends on the specific court and case but plenty of proceedings *are* now recorded via audio or video in addition to stenography.

With JUST an audio record, they'll have had to make timestamp notes during court, or they'd have to listen to whole swathes trying to identify when the thing they're looking for happened. Now, most Judges used to be lawyers, and that means they are very good, quick readers, but tech gurus, not so much. Have you helped your Grandfather work Netflix? Yeah that.\n\nAdditionally, courtrooms can be busy places. You may have a Judge, 2 lawyers (with assistants) a male accused, a male witness, and maybe 8 male voices can sound awfully similar, so who said what? As a reporter, I'm in the room and adding entries when the speaker changes identifying who the speaker is.\n\nNow, courts aren't always one matter a day, right? Think of overnight arrests and bails, where there are 20-80 matters addressed over 7 hours, if you JUST had a voice recording, take those 8 male voices, multiply that by 60, and then mix in some women, and some manly woman and some feminine guys, snd don't forget, Robert Smith may be representing 4 different clients on the list.  Could you listen to 3 hours of fast paced dialogue and keep track of who was speaking? \n\nAnd of course, how would you keep track of which matters were addressed in which order?\n\nLet's go back to the technology angle. As the reporter I'm also the AV support ensuring the equipment works, monitoring sound quality and volume, is a lawyer standing too far from the mic? Is the witness sitting too close so all the record catches is heavy breathing? Wouldn't it suck to have to redo 5 hours of emotional testimony and cross examination because a soft spoken witness was answering while a heavy breathing lawyer reviewed notes, inhaling and exhaling an inch from the microphone? I'm in the room and can interrupt if the record is being compromised\n\nNow again, I'm not transcribing word for word but I annotate guideposts so a transcriptions can go in later and know who is speaking, or a judge can easily find the testimony of Shelly B. Witness and particularly the question and answer surrounding what she saw from the boat. Later when clerks are updating an accused'a next appearance maybe the clerk in the courtroom had messy handwriting, should you be stsyibg in jail until June 11, July 1, or june 1 at 1pm? Instead of guessing, you can email the records department who can control+F for the name of the accused and clarify the release date is June 1, 1pm.

        "body": "Let me preface this long and windy comment by stating that I'm not an expert on this topic but I did marry a court reporter :)\n\nMy wife was a court reporter in a big metro Superior Court when we first met. She covered lots of big ticket trials, murders, kidnappings, drug arrests, etc., etc.  I got to learn a bit about it from her and was fascinated by the technology and the approach.\n\nThis was almost 35 years ago when direct voice-to-print dictation wasn't as trustworthy as it might be today. Back then, CR's used a special steno machine with a custom 'dictionary' to capture real time court proceedings and interviews, etc. Sitting at the steno keyboard, the CR is not actually typing the discreet words she hears, they are really capturing word sounds and oft repeated phrases, using keystroke combinations on the steno keyboard to record them. As you might suspect, court room dialog involves the repeat of a lot of the same words, names, phrases and terminology in every trial. 'County Coroner', 'District Attourney', 'plaintiff', 'defendant', 'evidence', etc., ad nauseum. The steno dictionary marries a series of custom keystrokes to each of these phrases the CR hears as well as to common word/group sounds, so that instead of typing out 'District Attorney', the CR enters in two or three keystrokes corresponding to the steno dictionary entry for the same  ('acceleration = 'ak'+'selar'+'ashun' for instance). When you view the printed paper tape coming out of the steno machine during capture, it's not clear text but a series of characters and character groupings which to the uninitiated are just gibberish. The CR, on the other hand, can usually read this content back just as if they were reading plain text. Like I said, it's a fascinating activity to be around.\n\nWhen they need to actually reproduce the written, official transcript of a given trial or testimony, the steno software does a reverse rendering of the recorded keystroke contents. Those character strings and groupings are printed out in the transcript using the literal translation from the steno dictionary. The CR usually had to perform a fair bit of proof reading to correct any mistake or malapropisms introduced during the capture and subsequent translation back to text.\n\nProfessional stenographers can have tens of thousands of dollars invested in their equipment, software and systems, and are generally in high demand. The profession can also generate a ton of income for the CR as well. As I understood it, my wife was legally obligated to provide (and then retain for the future) a single printed copy of the court proceedings as part of the official court record. Anything else done with the material was up to the CR, aside from them having to retain the materials for some minimum period of time. In the case of death sentence proceedings, I think my wife was legally obligated to retain the materials for something like 10 years. Note that every DA's office, legal firm or paralegal assistant required printed copies of court proceedings. As I recall, the CR was legally obligated to provide the Court, the DA and the Defendants Attorney copies of the transcripts.\n\nIf not prohibited by the nature of the proceedings, CR's could also generate income selling daily transcripts to people willing to write big checks. Recall the OJ Simpson trial ?  The news outlets would buy each day's court proceedings directly from the CR for use during their reporting. Over the course of a long and well publicized trial, this could amount to a huge sum of money for the CR.\n\nMy apologies to any CR out there if I got any of my facts or recollections wrong :)",

At altitude there is much less air molecules and we must fly “faster” to read a certain indicated airspeed.

It’s common to see -50 degrees C at cruising altitude. Less drag means less thrust needed. Colder temperatures means better thermal efficiency with the engines.

These act as the brains of the intersection, it the the computer that we program to make the lights change how we want. We can control the timings of individual lanes and directions as well as coordinate several intersections together.\n\nUnfortunately, similar to how your computer can sometimes mess up, so can these controllers. Unlike your computer messing up, if these break, someone could get hurt. So, to help prevent opposing greens and other malfunctions, there is another device called a Conflict Monitor, also known as a Malfunction Management Unit (MMU). The MMU has a wire soldered card inserted into it that has a listing of the phases (normally numbered 1-16, for us anyways) that are allowed to run together. These number phases correlate with the straight through lanes, turn lanes, ped crossings, and any overlaps like flashing arrows.\n\nThe MMU is directly wired to the output of the cabinet, right where the lights are wired up to. It is watching for changes in voltages, and if the voltage gets too high for a phase that shouldn't be on, it triggers the cabinets built-in failsafe mode, aka red flash.\n\nIt's my job to troubleshoot what went wrong and fix it. Also maintenance, lots of maintenance.\n\nEdit: [Wanted to show a picture](https://imgur.com/gallery/traffic-cabinet-inside-piDE4AY) now I've made it to work.\n\nThe blue box in the center is the controller, the black box to the right is the MMU.",

They have been decided upon by people with authority, and you are expected to follow them. If you don't follow the rules, the consequences have also been decided by people with authority.\n\nThe rules of language are more like the laws of nature, they're \"descriptive\". No one has decided what the rules are, instead the rules are more like observations. For instance, if you only ever see black crows, you might tell people \"all crows are black\", and that would be a rule. But it turns out [that some crows are white](https://www.birds.cornell.edu/crows/whitecrows.htm). You can't tell a white crow that it's breaking the rules. It's not the crow that's wrong, it's the rule.\n\nThe consequences of breaking the rules of language are that people won't understand you as well, or they might be confused. When someone mispronounces a word, the problem isn't that they're breaking a rule, the problem is that the person they're talking to might not understand. There are social expectations too, which are closer to the rules around clothing. There's nothing technically \"wrong\" about wearing underwear on your head, but people will find it weird, and you're expected to try and fit in with society. Similarly, you're expected to know how to pronounce complicated words.\n\nWhat actually happens when an accent (or other difference in language) drifts further and further, is that it becomes a new register, style, variety, dialect, or even a new language. If you live in the United States, you might be familiar with [African-American Vernacular English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_Vernacular_English), which some Americans consider to be \"broken English\", but is actually a variety of English with very specific rules that are consistent across communities. Similarly, in Scotland, the Scots language is a \"sister language\" to English, which is very different in a lot of ways, but people who speak Scots and people who speak English can mostly understand each other, even if a lot of words and pronunciations are confusing.",

Typically, these drones are rather cheap and not intended to return to base, so as long as they get the job done then the little string attached becomes a non-issue.\n\nI'm not sure if it's still used in modern arsenals, but for a long time, torpedoes for maritime warfare were also guided by wire with a long spool attached to the back for very similar reasons. Because submarines are about as agile as a tortoise, the stealthier craft wins, and using radio waves to guide things is like turning on a big spotlight.",

Before humans came along to kill them, megafauna mainly existed in the world's three great plains ecosystems: the African savannah, the Eurasian steppes, and the North American great plains.

North America had mammoths, saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, etc. Europe had cave lions, woolly rhinos, and more. South America had giant armadillos and big predators. Then, about 10,000 to 15,000 years ago, humans spread rapidly across the Americas and parts of Europe. Shortly after, most of the megafauna vanished.\n\nThis didn’t happen in Africa and much of Asia because big animals evolved alongside humans there. Over hundreds of thousands of years, they learned to avoid humans and defend themselves. But in the Americas and parts of Europe, humans showed up quickly and were new to the ecosystem. The animals there weren’t prepared, so they were easier to hunt or outcompete.\n\nAlso, Africa’s climate didn’t change as much after the Ice Age, so habitats stayed more stable. Asia’s huge size and variety of ecosystems also gave big animals remote or protected areas to move to. Whereas Europe and North America had bigger climate swings and more habitat loss due to glaciers and later agriculture.\n\nSo it’s not that the Americas and Europe never had lots of big animals. They did. But humans arrived later and faster and wiped out almost everything except the biggest and meanest animals or the most prolific procreators.

Water is scarce, the climate is unforgiving, and there's rolling hills, giant deserts, impassable mountains, and large coverless fields of grass everywhere. \n\nAll of this means that you have intense competition for resources and thus and accelerated evolution, coexistence, and symbiosis. And indeed, African fauna are notoriously vicious. \n\nI'll give you an example: Mosquitoes. They thrive in the warm, humid regions of Africa. But mosquitoes also suck blood. Which means they rapidly transmit disease. Which means lots of death. Which means species need to constantly evolve to evade them or resist them. And thus we have [Zebra stripes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/search/research-news/4655/); the leading theory is that the distinct striping pattern evolved because it makes it difficult for mosquitoes to identify them. \n\nBut now, you have booming populations of hardy zebras out and about grazing. Mosquitoes are no longer thinning their numbers out. And with that many prey, it's open season for predators like lions and cheetahs. They kill all the slow ones, and only the fast zebra are left. And now the zebra have gotten so fast and endurant that the predators can't really catch up to them anymore and have to be smart, like waiting for them near patches of water or evolving to [hide among the vast fields of grass](https://conservationcubclub.com/how-african-lions-camouflage/). And so now, they kill all the lone and unaware zebra. So now only zebra that travel in herds are left, making it difficult to single out individual prey (safety in numbers). So lions evolve to hunt in packs too (strength in numbers), and viciously maul entire herds, so now only the strongest zebra are left with [ridiculously strong hind legs to kick lions](https://allafrica.com/stories/202101160323.html). \n\nAnd on and on it goes.

So if you want to travel faster spacially, you will have to go slower in the time dimension, with the limit being that as you approach your spacial velocity becoming c, your temporal velocity will tend to zero.\n\nHowever, if you include the effects of general relativity, the equations show that time moves slower nearer large masses, and since an astronaut orbiting a spacecraft is further away from the earth, they experience time quicker from general relativistic effects and slower from special relativistic effects.\n\nPutting the numbers in gets that for a satellite orbiting the earth, special relativity slows the clocks by 7.2us / day and general relativity speeds up the clocks by 45us / day.

If you add a capacitor it can provide that momentarily higher required output without impacting the other systems reliant on the same power source. Similarly, there is a fairly large capacitor in most AC compressors, it fires when the AC starts up because it takes much more power to start the AC than it does to maintain it. If you didn't have that capacitor you could shut the lights off in the house every time the AC clicks on. The capacitor recharges extremely fast, so (in the example of the car stereo) even if you have successive large draw events provided there is a small number of fractions of a second between events the capacitor can continue to charge/discharge as required. \n\nThis ability to hold a charge is fundamental to the way microcircuits in computers work.

It could be that part of the speech centre is damaged so the brain reroutes through a part accociated with memory, and so its mixing the two up and it becomes like an imitation of an accent. It could be that it's simply affected/slurred speech in just such a way that it sounds like an accent. From looking it up, it seems to be related to a part of the brain related to melody and rhythmn of speech, so the accent may indeed just be coincidence, and if it was slightly different it would merely be a speech impediment.",

It still has blades but they are positioned vertically next to one another, pulling in air from the outside (usually via holes in the base) and forcing it out very quickly (aka induction) in a perpendicular direction.\n\nThat air is often forced out through the edges of a plastic ring at high speed but with fairly low volume. The process creates a low pressure zone within and around the ring (this is called the Bernoulli principle) that sucks in more air from behind the ring (aka entrainment) where it flows through and gets pushed further by the air from the blower, increasing the volume of air moved.\n\nSo it is kind of a marketing thing because it still has blades, however the induction / entrainment effect of forcing air out through the edges of the ring which in turn pulls additional air through the ring is interesting and reasonably practical.\n\nAs for more efficient? Eh, not really. A traditional fan moving air with large, slower-moving blades tends to already be extremely efficient at moving a significant volume of air at a reasonable speed, and the bladeless fan moves much less air at a much higher speed which is less efficient but recovers some of that efficiency when it pulls other air through the ring along with it, but it's still not as efficient as the traditional fan.",

Or would failed pregnancies, as well as the increase in birth and delivery complications, combined with (perhaps) a lower survival rate of children with elderly mothers, create a net drain? There's also a cost to society in the form of a reduction in the adult-to-child ratio: fewer grandmothers available to help raise their grandchildren, for example, because they're more focused on their own young children. \n\nIf the grandmother cohort is smaller (because they're still functioning as parents, and because more of them die in childbirth) then the mother cohort has to spend more of its energy focused on raising children, when those women are young enough to be doing other producing hunting & gathering labor.\n\nThis is all speculative. Evolutionary biology of this type is interesting to think about but only barely a science, because science demands a testable hypothesis, and it's very hard to come up with testable hypotheses about the behavior of early humans. Therefore we're often reduced to saying, \"Well, that makes sense from a logical perspective\" which is, to be honest, pre-enlightenment thinking.\n\nThings that \"make sense from a logical perspective\" have been proven wrong thousands of times by the rigor of scientific testing - quite frankly, they're often just reflections of our own assumptions and biases.

We’re just too used to being sitting and we definitely don’t do basic exercises 14 hours a day so we slouch and it is comfortable for us cause we’d have to use muscles to gain a better posture. All muscles, even when they are resting, they burn calories and are active. Lacking those muscles would lead someone to slouch!

It broke down under harsher scrutiny, of course, but a lot of people either couldn't or didn't want to put in that effort to catch him.\n\nSecond though, and crucially, he kept the returns he was promising relatively low and got the investors to keep their money there. A Ponzi scheme works as long as the new money coming in is greater than the interest that needs to be paid out. The thing is, Bernie Madoff deliberately kept the rate at which he needed to pay out low by offering more modest interest rates (compare his 15% per year to Charles Ponzi's 50% across 45 days or 100% across 90 days) *and* by targeting customers who were happy to park their money with him. Charles Ponzi needed to find new money within a couple of months. A lot of Madoff's clients only needed to be paid 5% of their alleged balance per year - so the initial investment could last over 10 years before needing to be \"topped up\".\n\nBy keeping the amount he paid out low relative to the amount initially paid in, he could make the scheme last quite a while. Right up until the financial crisis hit and everyone needed their money at once, which caused the money out side to get above the money in and collapsed the whole thing.",

        "body": "At a really high level:\n\n- government debt is a specific contract between the government and whoever holds the debt (usually, although it's possible for debt to be non-transferable) \n- government debt works like \"normal\" debt: the government gets some amount of something, and in return promises to pay back some amount of something at specific times and in specific amounts \n\nIt's important to note up front that when people talk about country X owing $A to country Y, that doesn't mean that this is some kind of outstanding debt that can be \"called\" or demanded to be repaid at any time. The debt is structured and almost none of it is going to allow an investor to instantly get their money. That would make issuing the debt kind of pointless, because the whole idea is that you get money now and then repay it gradually. \n\n___\n\nFor ease of use, I'm going to talk about bonds because that's a reasonable generic term for the kind of debt we are talking about.\n\nThe reason I'm being very generic about what the government gets and what the government promises to pay is that those can be different depending on the debt and depending on the country. (I'm going to talk about differences by country because it's even more complicated if you talk about the fact that countries can issue different kinds of bonds.)\n\nFor example, when the US government sells bonds, those bonds are denominated in US dollars. The government accepts US dollars as payment for the bond, and what it promises to pay back is also US dollars. For developed countries, this is how things usually work. The developed country wants its own currency and promises to pay back its own currency. \n\nThere's one weird trick that people lending to the government hate, though: for debt where the government is accepting its own currency and then paying back its own currency over time, the government can just print more currency to repay the debt. That almost inevitably causes inflation, meaning that the money people get back for the debt is inherently less valuable than the money they gave the government in the first place. \n\nThis inflation risk is one reason why people demand the government pay them more than the government got. In fact, one of the ways you can figure out how much inflation people expect is by looking at how much the government has to offer in order to sell its bonds. \n\nMost developed countries have debt issued by their government that is owned by entities outside of their country. For example, the Bank of Japan, which is an official government bank, owns about 1.1 trillion dollars of US debt. But in developed countries, people often conflate foreign private investment with foreign public investment. This is a mistake geopolitically, because arguably if the Japanese government itself were worried about being paid back by the United States, it would have a lot more leverage than individual investors from Japan. Of course the Japanese government would represent the interest of the people of Japan, but there's a real argument to be made that it might be a less forceful advocate for private parties than for itself.\n\n___\n\n\nFor developing countries, though, things get more complicated. Many people who have access to a lot of money don't want to give $100 million USD to a developing country in return for a 30-year bond **paid back in that country's currency**. Even with a really high interest rate, the perceived risk that the government will simply inflate its currency to pay the debt is so high that if the government actually wants cash that it can spend, it has to agree to different terms. \n\n(A government which owed a lot of debt to foreign investors in its own currency, and which didn't have a lot of international trade, would be much more willing to print money to pay off that debt than a government which is intimately involved in the world economic system. That's because the repercussions of printing off money to send to somebody 2,000 miles away are low compared to printing money to spend within your country as long as you don't do a lot of international trade.)\n\nThose terms are usually that the debt is denominated in something other than the actual national currency. I'm not going to pick an actual country to avoid any controversy. But let's say we have a country X which has considerable national resources and seems to be doing reasonably well economically, but also suffers from political turmoil. The opposition party has somebody who appears to believe that paying off government debt by just printing money is fine. \n\nThe current government of X still needs to finance operations. And in order to facilitate economic development, it wants to invest in infrastructure. It doesn't actually have the money to do that, so it looks for investors, especially International investors, to provide capital. \n\nThose investors might require that the repayment to them be in a different currency. For example, they might say \"I'll give you $100 million US right now in return for a bond that says you will repay me over 10 years...but you have to repay me in USD, not your own currency\".\n\nIf the entity giving that loan is a government, or a central bank of a government -- in this case it would probably be the Federal Reserve of the United States -- then there is actual debt where country X owes the United States money directly.\n\nSo when we talk about the debt of developing countries, it's often important to know that that debt is actually in dollars or Euros or yuan or whatever. Like, the government has to somehow acquire that currency in order to repay the debt. This is why countries can get into currency crunches. If they can't actually get enough dollars to repay their foreign debt that says they have to pay it back in dollars, that's a big problem.",

It chemically rips apart the cell membrane and kills the bacteria. It is also doing this to the cell membranes on our skin. But our membranes are a bit tougher and are protected by additional fats and oils. Plus there are many layers of them that have to be destroyed before anything really bad happens (and they are constantly being regenerated). \n\nBut if you was you hands alot, you will start to do noticeable damage to them. Dry skin from lots of hand washing is a result of those protective oils being stripped away and the soap may begin to attack the outer layers of skin. But again, you’d have to wash much much more than this (and ignore the inevitable pain) for anything really bad to happen.",

That’s been the case for decades.\n\nVideo recordings may add context to some actions but would also reveal minor unprofessional behaviours or events that could lead a pilot to be accused of being unprofessional. For example, pilots brief themselves on the departure aerodrome layout, the route, the weather all along the route, arrival procedures, arrival aerodrome and tons of notices that might affect the flight, if a pilot forgot to check something and subsequently rebriefed enroute it might be held against them. Being afraid to check for fear or being accused of unprofessional behaviour is worse than admitting fault. Or another example would be when ATC tell a pilot off and the pilot wants to silently and harmlessly vent by silently mouthing “fuck off” at the console.\n\nBasically, when you’re flying a plane for half a day at a time you benefit from the privacy that a blind (but not deaf) cockpit affords you. The worries that might follow being on camera the entire time adds pressure, possibly stress too, and may reduce the capacity of a pilot to act professionally and with as little fear or judgement as they currently do in certain situations.",

He looked for transfer evidence, any footprints left behind, the color of the skin, how the death occurred and what type of instrument was used.  He noted knife wounds with or without serrations, the approximate shape and strength of a blunt force trauma weapon and so on.\n\nThe idea of making deductions from the evidence that could be inferred from the scene was a novel approach, but it came to us from the books about Sherlock Holmes.\n\nThis ideas inspired science to create a better, more in depth way of making those observations.",

        "body": "Modern technology changes very little. It only catches stupid criminals. A reasonably smart and experienced criminal won't leave DNA evidence behind at a murder scene. Nor will he be caught by video cameras. Those are both relatively easy traps to avoid.\n\nThe biggest challenge, to this day, is a. psychological, and b. social. It's much harder to act normal after the murder, and ensure that your friends, family or criminal associates won't give you up, than it is to avoid getting caught with technology.\n\nLet's start with psychology: The greatest case study of a murder anyone could ask for is actually not a real case study. It's the novel Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostojevski. If you read it, you will realize that the Police don't really need to do anything extraordinary to catch a typical murderer. They just have to be present in communities (communities which actually talk to the Police, of course). The murderer will reveal himself over time, all on his own.\n\nYou see, the vast majority of murderers are psychologically broken people who don't have the ability to control their impulses or conceal their crimes. They don't just leave evidence behind at the crime scene, they also continue to invite Police attention after the crime. \n\nThis is almost a given. It's very rare for someone to be able to handle the trauma of committing the murder, the guilt they feel,  and/or the fear of getting caught, and just keep living their life as if everything was normal. They invariably do silly things that give them away.\n\nAll that needs to happen is for someone to notice and let the cops know. This is of course not a given. Chicago, for instance, has an abysmal homicide clearance rate. The official numbers are bad even if you believe them (and you shouldn't, they're manipulated).\n\nThat's not because Chicago criminals are particularly smart. That's because the Police are unable to be present in many communities (because they aren't welcome). They rely exclusively on technology, and, as it turns out, even modern technology is far inferior, as a policing tool, to the simple presence of Police in a community which values law and order and cooperates with law enforcement.\n\nAnother thing to note is that Dostoevskij's murderer is a loner. That's actually an advantage for the murderer, but most of them aren't loners. They have associates, and those associates are also quite likely to give them up to the Police. So that's another very easy way Police can catch a murderer. But, again, this requires consistent, low level Police activity: picking perps up for petty crimes, interrogating them, making deals with them (having some actual leverage to use in those deals ... when petty crimes go unpunished, the cops lose the ability to convince a low level criminal to give up a murderer).",

Just like your fridge, they have a gas or fluid in a tube that they compress and expand at different points.\n\nBy compressing the fluid at one end and allowing it to expand at the other end, and by using the surrounding air to heat / cool the pipes, it can take a lot of heated fluid and turn it into a cooler gas.  Depending on which way the pump works this either takes heat from outside and \"pumps\" it inside, or heat from inside and \"pumps\" it outside.\n\nIt's only a tiny effect but if it has a large volume of piping (heatsinks, etc.) in the open air and it can move lots of air past it, it can take a large amount of cool air and make a tiny amount of heat indoors, or take a large amount of heat indoors and vent it outside.\n\nThere is no connection between the inside and outside air... the only thing that passes through both is the pipework and refrigerant fluid.  So keeping the two sets of air separated and moving heat gently from one side to the other, it makes one side cool or heat depending on which way it's running.\n\nThe compression/expansion turns the fluid from a gas to a liquid and vice versa, and that transition either takes or releases a lot of energy.  By choosing when to compress it, and where to allow it to expand, you can heat or cool two different areas.\n\nYour fridge does the same... it has a small enclosed insulated area that it cools and it has a large heatsink and pipes on the back that it moves the refrigerant through.  It has a compressor that compresses the fluid, and a section of pipework where it's allowed to expand.\n\nAnd because it's never \"heating\" the air itself, just compressing it and moving it around,  it's far more efficient and cheaper to run.\n\nI have my heatpump working right now, in the UK.

The way this is accomplished is there is a compressor in the loop and a restriction valve to make it so one side can have a lower pressure than the other. The high pressure side will have liquid refrigerant and the low pressure side will have gaseous refrigerant.  \n\nNow it is just a consequence of physics that when liquid changes from liquid to gas (or it boils) that it reduces its temperature, and when you take gas and turn it into liquid it gets warmer.  \n\nWhen the refrigerant is pumped into the low side it instantly boils, this takes any heat from the walls of the tube, and puts it into the now gaseous refrigerant, then the compressor pumps the gaseous refrigerant into the high-pressure side (the hot side) where it will turn back to liquid, and also be hot. The refrigerant will transfer it's heat to the walls of the tube on the hot side and return to a low temp but as a liquid, and then it gets let into the low pressure side and the loop begins again.  \n\nThis is the normal refrigerant loop that you have in like a refrigerator, but the difference for the heat pump is there is some valves that reverse the flow of the refrigerant and so you can choose which side is cold and which side is hot.  \n\nNow what is the refrigerant? Technically you can use anything that you can turn into liquid and gas, you can even use water but if the refrigerant isn't able to be easily turned into liquid and gas then you will need bigger tubes bugger compressors and bigger valves.",

The entry node knows the client and which relay to forward the packet to, which it finds out when it decrypts the first layer and reads the headers telling it which relay to use.

The exit node gets the packet decrypts the last Tor layer and discovers the server. It only knows the relay and the server, but not the entrance or the client.

Photons themselves have no charge. The strong nuclear force works by particles which have a property called ‘colour’ emitting and absorbing gluons. Quarks have colour, and so feel the strong nuclear force. Gluons also have colour, and so also emit and absorb gluons. \n\nThis effectively means the strong nuclear force interacts with itself, and this gives it the strange property that it gets stronger the further apart you try to pull apart two quarks. Kind of like a spring, or an elastic band. And just like a stretched spring is a store of energy, there’s energy stored in the bond between the two quarks.\n\nEventually, the energy in the bond will be more than the energy required to just create two quarks out of thin air, and so that will happen. A bit like how an elastic band stretched too far will snap and release the energy it stored.\n\nRather than two quarks, you will have four. If the quarks are still moving apart (possibly because you smacked the proton they came from very, very hard) this process can happen again and again, creating even more quarks.\n\nThis leads to what are called “hadron jets” (hadrons being particles made of quarks) as this process happens repeatedly and creates sprays of new quarks, which coalesce into mesons (particles with two quarks) and baryons (particles with three quarks).",

A surge suppressor can do the same thing. Just make sure everything involving your network plugs into the same outlet, given that your house power is the source of the issue.

Technically, the cable modem should have the coax interface isolated and the unit be double isolated. If you can get an earth connection from the RJ45 - this could be an issue - more an EE question - I used to design and build parts of these networks - you try to ensure that the earths are managed in the carrier network side in order to reduce the capacitance build-up of coax runs. I don't know this specific network or standards - If it were me (I'm not providing advice) I would raise this as a concern to look at the block on the house and earth at the tap.

In some bands, you'll hear drum lines - the masters of rhythm and timekeeping - saying \"dut dut dut\" out loud to keep themselves in sync. I wouldn't start dutting during a foxtrot, for example, but I hope those examples paint a more realistic picture for you.

Our brains are wired to recognize auditory and visual patterns that allow us to connect sights and sounds to the abstract concepts of the things being communicated (e.g. seeing a picture of a dog connects you to the idea of a dog in your mind). Agnosias are a breakdown of those processes in the absence of visual or auditory impairment, leading to some pretty weird cognitive disabilities. Face blindness is a visual agnosia that prevents people from recognizing other people’s faces (which is something I struggle with).\n\nBut to answer your question, think of the beat like the syllables in a word. Music has a rhythm that is typically a factor or multiple of your heart rate. The beat happens in a regular timing pattern, usually **1**, 2,3,4 (with a heavier beat on ‘1’ and lighter beats on 2, 3, and 4).\n\nThe beat can be kept by different instruments depending on the genre. For most contemporary music, it’s the drums. The heavy “thwack” is beat 1, followed by 3 minor beats (“dum de-dum”).\n\nWith music that lacks percussion instruments (like classical or folk music), it’s much harder if you can’t “feel” the beat.

You’ve probably heard “five six seven eight” before you begin a dance. That’s to help you get a feel for the beat. \n\nThe first beat of a bar is called the “down beat”. It’s commonly where a new musical idea comes in. It might be a singer starts singing, drums kick in, a melody starts, the key changes etc. this is something you’ll have to feel first. \n\nTry to find a song with a simple straightforward beat. I’m listening to Black Milk by Massive attack right now and it has a very simple repeating drum pattern. Try listening to that. \n\nWhile you listen to it, tap your hand on your leg with your hand in a consistent pace along with the drums. If you’re having trouble, it’s 84 bpm. Turn the song off and play a metronome at 84 bpm. Tap your hand along with the clicks. Count the clicks in groups of 4 (1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4). Emphasize the ones and the threes. Tap a bit harder on one and three. When you have a feel for it, try keeping the beat without the metronome in silence. Then turn the song back on and try to tap along again while counting. \n\nAnother song to try is basically any Pharrell produced song, but listen to Cash In Cash Out. At the beginning there is a clear 1 2 3 4. When that comes in, start your counting and repeat it through the song. \n\nThen just try to keep doing that with everything you listen to. Try clapping, nodding your head, tapping a finger, tapping your foot, whatever comes most naturally. You will start to hear the musical phrases that “restart” every 2 4 8 and 16 bars. \n\nThen try counting the bars like 1234, 2234, 3234, 4234, 1234, 2234, etc etc. you’ll be able to anticipate the changes in the music, which will help with your dance and staying on beat.

Although the electron could *technically* be found miles away from the nucleus, the probability of it being more than a few angstroms away from it is nearly zero. \n\nYou can think of a transistor as a wire with a switch in it. When the transistor is activated, the gate closes letting current through. But when it’s inactivated, the gate is open, and there is a gap separating the two sides, preventing current. As transistors get smaller and smaller this gap also gets smaller and smaller. Eventually, they can get small enough that the wavefunction of electrons in the current can actually reach the other side of the gap to a not-insignificant degree.

When an electron hits a barrier, since it’s a wave some of that wave passes through and some of that wave is reflected, like light hitting glass. For an electron, the thinner the barrier, the more of the wave passes through. Once enough of the wave passes through, it becomes likely that the electron will completely jump over (I don’t know how to ELI5 that part). The best analogy I can think of is waves in water. If you’re next to a fence in the water and you make a wave, part of it will go through and part of it will be reflected back. If it’s a chain link fence, not much will be reflected.

If another bank decides that they don't need much more cash on hand, they might not follow suit, and keep their rates as-is.\n\n\nAs far as 12 month vs 18 months CDs, in finance there is a generic concept called the \"Time Value of Money\", which essentially says that having money in your hand right now is preferable to a promise of getting that same amount of money in the future. The further in the future you have to wait for the money, the more less you desire it. This is because a) there is some amount of risk that a promise won't be kept, and b) if you have to wait for the money you might miss out on opportunities to use it in valuable way.\n\n\nAs a result, the further in the future an expected payment is, the bigger it has to be to make it worth your while.

For example, I taught my latest dog to Paw me with her left paw and she very gently paws up against my leg or arm or whatever body part she can get at when she wants to go outside. It’s fantastic. I don’t have to keep looking at her and asking the question do you wanna go outside now? All I have to do is wait for her to tell me when to go and it turns out it’s about the same time of the day every day and repeat.    What I did to start was use the small soft pellet training treats. They are soft and small kind of the consistency of a marshmallow thats flavored and the dog loves them they hardly chew them, but if you see dog trainers on a dog show he’s got a pocket full of those and gives them to the dog on every trick.  So I alternate it from time to time where I’ll train the dog on the trick and then I’ll have the dog do tricks without giving the dog a treat and I’ll do that for a couple of days and the dog is just fine but then the motivation waines And then I’ll start giving treats again.    The whole point is you can give the dog plenty of these treats and they hardly amount to anything in their diet or in their stomach. And you can keep them on their food schedule without worry about over feeding or the dog not being hungry. They are affordable, although not the cheapest. Lastly, doggies really willing to work for that teeny tiny little treat and learn new tricks easily.",

It only has anything to say about the probable outcomes of measurements.\n\nWhen someone tells you that, according to quantum theory, a system is in a superposition of states, they're lying to you. It's the probabilities of the various possible measurement outcomes that are \"in superposition\".\n\n\"Wave function collapse\" is the transition from calculating measurement outcome probabilities to taking an actual measurement. What happens to probabilities in the face of actual results is an interesting question, but it's not a physical event in the quantum system.\n\nWell actually it's a bit fuzzy, because whatever interaction is necessary to ultimately end up with a measurement may in fact effect the state being measured. And the theory can't address questions like, \"would the particle have passed through that point if the detection screen hadn't been there?\" because it doesn't actually model system behavior.\n\nThis \"observer\" weirdness arises because we're trying to understand physical behaviors with a theory which speaks only about measurement outcomes. You're perhaps being told that the theory suggests the \"observer\" has some sort of effect on the evolution of the system, but the theory doesn't really have anything to say about the behavior of the system at all.",

What that means exactly is quite advanced but these axioms are where the observers and measurements come from. An axiom is essentially just a list of your assumptions that you're making before you start, and the Dirac-von Neumann axioms assume that there are these things we've called observers and they do these things we've called measurements.\n\nWhat that means is that quantum mechanics as it's formulated under these axioms, is not a theory about what's actually happening in the real world. We call this \"ontology\", which means \"what is actually true in the real world\". Dirac-von Neumann quantum mechanics says absolutely nothing about ontology. All it says is, what would an observer see on a measuring device when they make a measurement during a quantum experiment.\n\nAnd this is obviously a huge issue if you believe that the job of physics, and indeed science, is to try to describe what's going on in the real world. The Dirac-von Neumann version of quantum mechanics is correct in the sense that it makes correct predictions about the measurements, but it says nothing at all about the nature of observers and measurements because it just assumes them into existence.\n\nSo, people have subsequently tied themselves in knots trying to interpret what this might mean for the real world, what pieces they can add to the theory to get it to say something about the real world, and so on. These are things like the Copenhagen Interpretation, many worlds hypothesis, and so on. None of these explanations is widely accepted and they all have weaknesses.\n\nSo the simple answer to your question is, we have absolutely no idea what an observer or a measurement is, and anyone who says they know is giving you their interpration. But the reality is that there are many interpretations and none of them has yet gained wide acceptance. We simply don't know. The fact that we don't know and haven't made all that much progress towards knowing as of yet, is one of the big weaknesses of quantum theory.",

But the \"cameras\" we're viewing these experiments with aren't actually cameras in the traditional sense. In some cases, we're blasting a medium out to measure the angle of interaction, while in others, the \"camera\" is actually a polarized lens that causes an electron excitement which interacts with the photons passing through it. We cannot design a camera made of stuff to take pictures that small, it's not a tech problem, it's laws of the universe stuff. \"Stuff\" literally cannot be that small so we can't make machines at that scale. We have to rely on bouncing other phenomena off the phenomenon we're trying to \"observe\", and then coming to conclusions based on the behavior, the way it \"bounces\". \"Observe\" kind of isn't even the right word, we just use it because it feels intuitive, but in reality, we more \"touch\" the double slit experiment than observe it.

Oftentimes senders would need to include postage for both their domestic postal service (to deliver it to the border of the other country) and the other country's postal service.\n\nThe UPU made things a lot simpler: countries become members of the UPU, implement its policies, and mail can easily flow between countries.\n\nOriginally countries assumed that each letter sent to a different country would get a letter in reply, so things were assumed to be in balance and the costs would simply balance out. This turned out not to be true, and eventually they came up with a system of \"terminal dues\" -- if Country A received more mail from Country B than Country B received from A (that is, the mail flow was imbalanced), then Country B would pay Country A a certain amount of money based on the weight of mail.\n\nOver the years, the terminal dues system has been updated and modified, such as where \"poorer\" countries pay lower terminal dues to \"richer\" countries (based on a specific scale that grouped countries into different classes based on a development score).\n\nEven though the specific details have changed over the years, the basic principle remains: if countries have a balanced flow of mail between them, there's no exchange of money since things are balanced. If there's an imbalance, the country that sends more mail pays the receiving country a fee.",

        "body": "Some weird replies going on here..\n\nELI5: Guns are angled up a tiny amount to allow rounds to hit a central point several hundred metres in the distance accounting for bullet drop. If the angle is too much, you make it actually harder to hit your target if they do any sort of maneuver other than flying in a flat turn. Movable guns are too complex and not worth the hassle, compared to a missile, which has replaced the gun in modern combat anyways. Guns are also multirole, and permanently angling up several degrees makes them hard to use against ground targets.\n\nIf you want to try it yourself and have access to any flying game or a sim, put a tiny bit of tape or blutack on the monitor far higher up than where the gunsight or targeting reticle is and you'll find you'll be making a lot of pitch down maneuvers to try and align that new targeting point with a twisting and turning moving aircraft \n\nNon-ELI5\n\nFirstly, movable guns aren't practical as it the mechanism to allow that would be complex, need to work during high G-force maneuvers, and would add extra weight and take up extra space for very little benefit. Space and weight are premium on any aircraft, but especially fighters. That cost and complexity is better spent on a close range missile which will be more mechanically reliable and are external pieces which don't add extra weight or take up space better utilised especially once the missile has been used.\n\nSecondly when dogfighting was a thing (which due to reliable missiles, it isn't the primary method of killing another plane) such as WWII this mechanism was too complex. Later, as missiles became reality, the gun was a back-up tool for dogfighting and became more of an inclusion for ground attack.\n\nThirdly, guns *are* generally angled upwards to some small degree. For WWII aircraft, the guns point upwards slightly, and inwards if they are mounted on the wing, so that the rounds will impact a set point in the distance componsating for bullet drop. This is called convergence, and was typically around 300m but it did vary and guns would be calibrated and adjusted on the ground. This practice continued with Jets slightly pushing this distance further, and in the case of aircraft like the F-15, F-18 etc the angle is more pronounced in order to slightly reduce how much lead the pilot will need to give the target but also not interfering with the ability to Strafe ground targets with it. Counter to this, aircraft like the A-10, and JF-17 do the opposite with guns angled slightly downwards to allow them to attack ground targets easier with their weapons, the trade off being they can't engage air-targets as easy but neither are designed for that role. That being said, having the gun angled up too much makes it difficult to hit targets that are trying to change direction a lot, if you had a gun angled at 10-15 degrees like in your comments then you're basically making it so your guns can never truly hit the center of your longitudinal axis, requiring you to have to pitch down which aircraft (and people) aren't great at handling compared to pitching up..\n\nThere are a couple of odd systems that do have moving guns, but these are for ground attack. The SPPU-6 gunpod on the SU-24 is an example, but again this was a heavy pod on an aircraft that was a bomber and able to take the weight and wasn't ever going to be dogfighting, and had an extra crewman who could aim the guns. \n\nFinally, counter to what you're saying, planes aren't 'trying to get their nose up as much as possible' in a dogfight, they're trying to make their turning circle as tight as possible. If they try and pull as much as possible 'without resorting to a cobra' they are going to stall out, which isn't a good idea. The cobra isn't for a gun kill anyways, it's supposedly for forcing an over shoot of a plane behind in order to then get a missile on them, after doing a cobra your aircraft isn't going to be able to line up a shot with a gun well due to the lack of speed and control. In reality it's an airshow gimmick.\n\nAnd *yes*, some aircraft had guns pointing upwards. No, it's not 'many' as one comment says, and it wasn't even 'many night fighters',  it was a pretty rarely done thing. Either way it misses your question referring to 'dogfights' as it is really the aircraft equivalent of a drive-by and was for shooting bombers.",

        "body": "\"Quantum\" really just means \"very very small\". So quantum mechanics means \"very very small mechanics\", or \"the way very very small stuff works\". \n\nWhy does it matter how very very small stuff works? Or to put it a better way, why does it matter *to us*? The answer is simply just that big things are made from small things. If we want to understand how big things work \"under the hood\", as we zoom in, eventually we're thinking about how small things work.\n\nOne of the frontiers of science that doesn't have a clear explanation yet, is that we have mathematical rules that work for big stuff (like, a few thousand atoms and bigger). If you take these mathematical rules and use them to calculate, say, how to get a satellite to Jupiter, or how to create a GPS system, or what the Earth is made of, you get the correct answer. So clearly these rules are \"correct\" in some sense. You may have heard terms like Newtonian mechanics, special relativity and general relativity - those are some of the rules for big stuff.\n\nHowever, these rules don't work for very very small things. Once you zoom in far enough, the math stops getting the correct answer. Things seem to work a different way. So we created some other mathematical rules to describe how the small stuff operates. And if you use those rules to calculate what will happen in experiments with the very very small stuff, you get mostly correct results. So it seems like these rules are also true in some sense. You may have heard of quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and lots of other quantum things - that's the rules for very very small stuff.\n\nThe issue is that these rules seem completely incompatible. They work in completely different ways and do completely different things. There doesn't seem to be much common ground between them in the mathematics, but obviously they must have a relationship because the big stuff is made of the small stuff, so they have to be related. We also know that there are some big gaps in the rules we have for the small stuff (for example, they don't include rules for gravity yet) and we will need to fix that as well.\n\nOnce we have a good understanding of the way the very very small stuff works, we will probably be able to use it to make better big stuff. An obvious example is that we may be able to make better computers, but it could also lead to more advanced industrial processes, more precise machining, and many other industrial and technological advances.",

He had me lay down and remove my shirt and his reaction was muffled holy shitcakes. He asks me if I mind if he brings in a colleague to assist, and I agree of course, this thing was goddamned painful.\n\nThey numbed it with a needle, sliced it open and began the extraction. I wish I could’ve seen the action, because these two doctors were like kids that had gotten a new train set for Christmas that was filled with candy and Legos; they squeezed and dug at it, trying to coax Rosemary’s Baby out of me, and finally I felt something… give. They both squealed with excitement and now they started working it furiously—with each new wad of gauze they reached for, it was whispered awe “it just keeps coming!”, “OMG! Gimme more gauze!”, and “Dude, you gotta measure the length of that… it won’t break!”\n\nAnyway, after the Santas emptied my toybag, they sat back like they needed a smoke break and it was just silence as they looked at the pile of whatever-the-fuck came out of me. They had to stuff the cavity it left behind with some medical thing “like gauze” but not really gauze, and close me up. \n\nI asked to see the debris they removed and they asked if I was sure, like I should sign a waiver to get on this ride. They relented and showed me a bag full of abortion that made me want to throw up, and they quickly wrapped it up in a red bag and then another red bag just to be safe and disposed of it in the infectious waste receptacle.\n\nStill to this day I really can’t describe what I saw, it was such a tangled rat king of blood, pus, green goo, black chunks, white, ropy tentacles that looked like an umbilical cord… it was awful and I think I have some mild PTSD over it, but those two sweet, sick fucks seemed to derive more joy from the experience than a person should, and when we went to pay the bill, the nurse at the counter told me it had been taken care of and handed me a printout of post-operative care instructions.",

So you may share an ancestor, but you wouldn't be related. \n\nObviously, people share 99.9% already. So we are just looking at the .1% of dna that we dont share with everyone.",

Blocking histamine stops the allergy symptoms and thats how allergy meds work. (More info: [Type I hypersensitivity reactions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_hypersensitivity))\n\nAllergy shots (desensitization) work by switching the antibodies from the special parasite type (IgE) to a normal/“good” type of antibodies (IgG) that don’t cause histamine release and allergy symptoms. \n\nPoison ivy isnt actually an allergy, its a different type of immune response where a chemical in poison ivy binds to your proteins and then immune cells show up to destroy them 1-2 days later. It doesn’t use special antibodies like allergies do and allergy meds don’t work well for it. Topical steroids are used instead as they make those immune cells chill out.

As the water in the ocean goes up (high tide) and down (low tide), two times a day in many places, it will release more water from the river on the outward (ebb) tide than on the inward (flood) tide. Taking the average of the flow during the complete tidal cycle will give you the river flow. As you go upstream, the tidal range, or difference between high tide and low tide gets smaller until eventually the river stage is no longer affected by the tides and solely by the river flow. \n\nDuring a flood, water coming downstream will be backed-up more than you would expect than from normal conditions, **but the tides will still happen**. Usually low tides will be higher than predicted by a larger amount than the high tides.  The location on the river where the tides \"stop\" will move downstream during a flood, however, you're close enough to the ocean that the tides will still dominate the water depths.  [In Newcastle, NSW, the tidal range, or the difference between the highest and lowest tide in one day is between about 0.9 to 1.7 m over the next 30 days](https://www.tide-forecast.com/locations/Newcastle-Australia/tides/latest).\n\nThat said, given your location (I'm assuming Stockton Bridge or the other bridge on B63), *I don't actually think you're still seeing flood waters anymore*. [The recorded water levels at Stockton Bridge look pretty normal](http://www.bom.gov.au/fwo/IDN60232/IDN60232.561088.plt.shtml). Instead, I think you're seeing the so-called \"[King Tides](https://www.msq.qld.gov.au/tides/king-tides)\" or \"[Perigean Spring Tides](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/perigean-spring-tide.html).\" [The highest-high tides of the year are occurring about now in Newcastle.  ](https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8968111/central-coast-council-meets-with-minister-about-coastal-erosion-as-king-tides-predicted/)On top of this, large waves (\"swell\") in the ocean will push water onshore as the hit the beach as will wind directed onshore. Those effects will cause the water at the shore to rise over a longer period of time, causing both low tides and high tides to be higher than expected.\n\nTo ELI5 \"Perigean Spring Tides\": The tidal range changes over a 14-day period based on the 28-day cycle of the moon going around the earth, called the \"spring-neap\" cycle. \"Spring\" in this context does not mean the season, \"spring\" tides happen every 14 days. Spring tides roughly coincide with New and Full moons, while neap tides are during quarter-moon phases. During spring tides, the difference between high tide and low tide is the largest, so high tides are higher and low tides are lower. During neap tides, the range is smallest, so the water doesn't change as much during the twice-daily tidal cycle.\n\nAs the moon orbits the earth, the distance between the moon and the earth changes. This distance affects how strongly the moon's gravity affects the tides. \"Perigee\" describes when the moon is closest to the earth in it's 28-orbit, and hence the gravitational pull is strongest. When perigee lines up with a new or full moon (spring tide), it's called \"Perigean Spring Tides\" and causes the greatest tidal range. Depending on other factors controlling the \"midpoint\" of the tide, \"Perigean Spring Tides\" can create the highest high or lowest low tides of the year and happen 6-8 times a year. The largest of these are often called \"King Tides\" and happen twice a year, when all of the other various astronomical influences on the tides line up.",

On the other hand, if you turn it off when you’re not using it and let the room warm up, then only cool it down when you’re there, you avoid all that unnecessary energy use.

In a perfect world, your AC unit will turn on and never turn off, just slowly increase/decrease capacity as needed. I often explain this like a car gas pedal. You don't floor it at 50 and accelerate to 60, then shut off your engine and coast to 50. You maintain just enough power to cruise at 60.\n\nAC units take at least two minutes to stabilize and run optimally. If it cycles on and runs for 5 minutes, you're losing efficiency.\n\nInrush (starting) current is high for electric motors, but doesn't matter for residential electrical rates, at least in my area. However, commercial and industrial electrical is often billed on peak load. So a bunch of equipment turning on and off is bad for billing.\n\nFor a house, it's better to maintain temperatures rather than \"catch up\" from an overheated home. You're not just regulating air temperature, but all of the thermal mass (furniture, walls, ceiling, floor etc) and humidity as well. Wood, fabric etc all absorb moisture and will need to be dried out over time by the AC reducing Relative Humidity in the air, which allows the moisture to move back out of the fabric/wood etc and into the air, to be removed by the AC.\n\nThis last one is why unit sizing and variable speed help you so much. If your unit can't reduce capacity, or especially if it is oversized, the air drops in temperature too quickly. The heat and moisture can't move from the solid matter to the air as quickly as the AC is removing it. So the AC turns off, the air warms back up and it kicks on again.",

Each species in the tank had a specific target where they would swim past and get food. The aquarists kept meticulous notes on who was eating and how much to tell them if there was a potential health issue.\n\nWhile I was there, one of our smaller sharks went off food for a while (which obviously worried the aquarists; they tried even harder to feed her each session with no luck). \n\nThen one morning they came in and found the barracuda had a bite wound that matched her size. She was hungry from not eating, went for something in the tank, and failed to catch it. They had to quarantine the barracuda to treat it. \n\nThankfully, the shark did start going for the provided food again.\n\nSo yeah, sharks hunt when they’re hungry, and aquariums work hard to keep them fed for both their health and the safety of their tank mates.\n\nOn another note, aquariums use two types of feeding: direct feeding and broadcast feeding. \n\nDirect feeding (like the target feeding mentioned) ensures you know who’s eating what. It’s especially helpful when giving medicine or supplements with the food. The sharks I described earlier were direct fed. There were only 2-4 of each species and enough subtle differentiation between them that you could tell who was eating.\n\nBroadcast feeding is just throwing stuff in there for whoever gets it. You can’t direct feed every single animal because there are just too many, and many species don’t have much differentiation between individuals. For broadcast feeding, you try to provide enough that every animal can get food. If an individual starts losing body condition, it’s either sick or not competing with the others (or both). That’s when you pull it from the exhibit, check it for issues, and then get it back up to size before putting it back in the exhibit. The other animals in the shark tank described earlier were broadcast fed.",

In MTG, players have to watch out for blue decks having extra mana and cards because they often play counterspells. A normal bluff from a blue player would be discretely holding back a useless card in their hand because if the opponent notices, they might suspect a counterspell and not play their big card. A triple bluff might be the blue player with a useless card ending their turn with an obvious line like \"and I end with two untapped blue mana and a card in my hand\". Saying that makes it stupidly obvious they're implying they have a counterspell (bluff 1), which makes the opponent immediately suspect that card is actually useless (bluff 2). However, most opponents will see the stupidly obvious bluff 1 as being too obvious, which means they'll assume that the blue player actually wants them to believe bluff 2, leading them to assume the extra card IS a counterspell (bluff 3) and therefore not play their big card.\n\nBut once you get that far down the rabbit hole, it becomes almost impossible to predict exactly how many \"bluffs\" an opponent will predict. That leads to the memes of \"he would know that I would know that he would know that I would know that he would know that I would know...\" ad infinitum.",

The enemy now thinks you're bluffing, and attacks. Double bluff!  \n\nBut what about if you're actually really weak there and you don't want them to attack, but you don't think a bluff will work? In comes the triple bluff. Normally this involves pretending to double bluff, but doing it so (deliberately) badly that your double bluff is caught. \n\nFor example, you publicly announce you're strong. You send the officer in to a brothel that's bugged to \"accidentally\" talk about your weakness. But you send the officer in to a brothel that *everyone* knows is wiretapped.

We're not falling for your pathetic attempt to try and get us to call your bluff and attack there. We'll attack somewhere else.\n\nExcept that was the goal all along.\n\nIt's a fine line between being incompetent enough to be believable, and being incompetent enough for the incompetence to be perceived as deliberate.\n\nFor a double bluff, it's really hard to pull off the fine line between being obvious enough to make sure your bluff gets \"exposed\", while also being secretive enough that it looks like the exposure was accidental. \n\nFor a triple bluff, it's an even finer line. You need to pull off a double bluff that is unbelievable enough that your double bluff gets caught.

It's a 'successful' outcome in terms of evolutionary fitness if it increases the chance of passing down the genes coding for a trait. If those extra years of puberty result in a net increase of viable fertile offspring being born to women as a whole, not only through the extra reproductive years but also because the longer the time period before puberty, the more likely the woman is to die of something else before reproducing at all, then it will be selected for.\n\n\nEvolution is amoral. It doesn't 'care' if some people suffer or die, its only 'goal' ( and it doesn't really have a goal any more than gravity has a goal ) is to propagate the gene coding for the trait. 100 extra girls die but a net of 200 extra babies born? It's being selected for.\n\n\nYou could argue the same about other aspects of childbirth, like the narrow pelvis of women vs relatively large heads of human babies.

Stromatolites are colonies of bacteria that are still found (again, Australia has a few good places such as Shark Bay where you see them). These colonies form mats on rocks and sand and dust gets caught up in the sticky goop. Over time, new stromatolites grow over the top and gradually very thin layers of sediment form, creating structures up to a metre or so across. The oldest fossils have these structures preserved in a tough mineral called chert, sometimes geyserite which is formed in hot springs.\n\nOlder indirect evidence for life has also been suggested. The most well known are streaks of graphite (carbon) found in the rocks of the Isua Complex in Western Greenland which are about 3.7 Gy. This has been suggested as being some form of organic ooze that has been heated and baked by the formation of the Isua rocks themselves. The issue here is that the Isua rocks have been heated and folded almost to the point of melting, so it is very hard to know their original state. Graphite is occasionally found in rocks without getting carbon from living organisms, so it might just be chemistry.\n\nThe oldest known potential evidence goes back to 4.1 Gy and it relies on a single grain of graphite found inside a zircon crystal from Jack Hills in - oh look, Australia again. Zircon is an immensely tough mineral, so stuff trapped inside is sealed from the moment the zircon was formed. The graphite was placed in a mass spectrometer and the ratio of carbon 12 to carbon 13 measured. And it was richer in carbon 12 than expected. Photosynthesis in algae (like those in stromatolites) very slightly prefers carbon 12 over carbon 13, so this tiny piece of graphite *might* have once been produced by life.\n\nhttps://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4664351/",

We know that if the atom loses or gains an electron it becomes an *ion*, which is just an atom with a slight electrical charge. This is a \"net\" electrical charge, as the charge of all of the electrons and protons \"cancel\" themselves out. If it has an extra electron it has a net negative charge, and if it loses an electron it has a net positive charge. \n\nIf the charges were very different, then all of the ways atoms interact with each other and form molecules would have to change drastically. \n\nAn electron has about 1/1836 the mass of a proton. If the charges were proportional to their mass, then a simple carbon atom would need over 11,000 electrons to become neutrally charged. But electrons have crazy amounts of energy and move in difficult-to-predict ways. They exist in electron shells around the atom, and only so many electrons can occupy each shell. The first shell is only 2 electrons. The next can have up to 8. \n\nThe maximum number of electrons in the largest shells in the largest known elements is 32. \n\nOganesson has 118 total electrons.

Whereas on warm sunny days their metabolism skyrockets and they can be much more animated and active. This is a much simpler and more efficient way of being, letting the environment provide much of the energy you need to live. But warm-blooded animals said \"screw that, we want to maintain high levels of activity regardless of external temperatures\" And the trade-off of that tiny range of survivable core temps and consuming far more energy overall turned out to be a good one as warm blooded creatures bodies generally kick ass and are capable of sustained high-energy activities like powered flight, and long distance running in any weather even if they have to eat a lot more food to make up for it.

It's really the other way around: being warm blooded is what lets you \"get away\" with having such strict requirements for body temp; the default, as much as that makes sense in biology, is for something to be about as warm as it's environment and to adapt to be able to survive like that instead. Being warm blooded was other benefits, like having about the same level of energy all the time, being able to survive in a wider range of climates, and letting your body specialize it's biochemistry more to certain temperature ranges, but it also costs energy and so is in the end a tradeoff. ",

        "body": "This is a great question, and the answer is that \"warm blooded\" and \"cold blooded\" just are not the whole story. They're a simplification.\n\nThe big important thing to understand is that enzymes are the things our bodies use to perform chemical reactions, and **their effectiveness depends on the temperature**. That's a basic chemical principle, and without enzymes, we can't metabolize, and if we don't metabolize, our cells end up starving. \n\nBasically, enzyme action is life. Without it, we die.\n\nWe are taught that a classic \"warm-blooded animal\" (like us), is able to generate its own heat. As a result, we keep our bodies at the temperature that is optimal **for the enzymes** that we need to keep us alive. Makes sense.\n\nWe are taught that a classic \"cold-blooded animal\" is unable to generate its own heat, and so its body temperature fluctuates. The best name for this is [poikilothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poikilotherm). You might've been taught a different word, but use this one. To stay alive, creatures whose bodies change temperature, have to have **multiple sets of enzymes**, as many as \"four to ten\" for important chemical processes, according to Wiki. These enzymes work across a range of temperatures, and so allow the creature to keep living and moving no matter what the temperature is.\n\nThey've used chemical tricks to avoid ever needing a constant body temperature in the first place.\n\nBut this means they have to produce multiple sets of enzymes, many of which aren't working efficiently. They avoid cellular starvation, by spending more energy on more genes for different kinds of metabolism.\n\n\\---\n\nThe opposite of poikilothermy is [homeothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeothermy). Homeotherms (like classic warm-blooded animals), don't have to have multiple sets of enzymes, because they've found some way to maintain a constant body temperature. This is more efficient; they don't have to produce multiple sets of enzymes. \n\nBut the cost is that if you lose the extra enzyme sets, then you're vulnerable to temperature. Your cells will starve if body temperature gets too low, because the enzymes aren't working well enough; you're no longer adapted for changes in body temperature.\n\nIf the way they maintain a constant body temperature is by generating their own heat, that's [endothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotherm). (That's us.)\n\nBut the reality is, some \"cold-blooded\" animals *are* homeothermic. For example: lizards. For a lot of them, their body temperature stays mostly the same, but they still can't produce their own heat. (That's [ectothermy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ectotherm); the word we're usually taught as \"cold-blooded\".) They move to the shade, and into the sun, to regulate their body temperature.\n\nBut the trade-off is exactly what you thought: a creature that is both homeothermic, and ectothermic, can't live across a wide range of temperatures. It's more vulnerable to temperature changes: it needs a relatively constant environment to live in.\n\nSo the cold-blooded creatures that can survive in the north (poikilotherms) aren't the same as the cold-blooded creatures that live in the tropics (other ectotherms).\n\n\\---\n\nWhen you combine all these different processes, it's possible to have both. There's a bunch of creatures in the middle; these are called [heterotherms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterothermy). For example, many hibernating creatures *are* endotherms: most of the year they produce their own heat. But during hibernation, they *switch to a different metabolic mode*, lowering their metabolism and body temperature for the hibernation period. This lets them get the \"best of both worlds\".",

Or they basically hibernate, but it's more like going into suspended life, rather than the \"sleep\" that we typically associate with hibernation.\n\nThe primary reason warm blooded animals, like us, have such a small window where we can function, is because we rely on a lot of other life (microbiomes) or chemical processes that only function properly within that small temperature. This is also why we get a fever when we're sick, as it's designed to destroy these infectious agents in the same way that it stops us functioning properly, we're just hoping that they die out before we do.\n\nBut it means we expend a lot of energy keeping ourselves warm, depending on our location, but it's the reason we (warm blooded animals) have spread throughout most of the world, where cold blooded (land) animals tend to stick to places that are either relatively consistent, so they don't have that winter downtime, or just places where they have a guaranteed period per year of that, even if they may have a few months where they have to be a bit more chill.\n\nCold blooded fish are the interesting middle ground, they developed systems that work when colder, but also remain relatively narrow similar to us, as water stays fairly thermally consistent, no matter the time of day or season. This does mean that global warming raising the ocean temperatures by only a few degrees could leave many of them in trouble, so it doesn't mean they're as resilient as the land based cold blooded animals we typically see, it just means their body temperature is lower than ours, and they often don't try and keep their skin/flesh warm.",

You're in a bind.\n\nSo the best way to do this is only make the changes at the end of development when you know you're not going to have to undo this or that assumptions will be upended are going to break everything.

The idea is when making a model, usually of characters but also of complex scenery, make many versions of it with different levels of detail. More details means harder to render, so the most complex model gets shown when the player is right near the object. As the player gets further away, less complex models take its place, and because you can't see as much difference at a distance, the player doesn't notice. This can get pretty extreme, just search up \"Mario 64 low poly Mario\" for some examples. \n\nA related improvement is a technique called imposters. Basically at a certain point, the player won't be able to tell or care if they're looking at a 3d object in the far background or a small image overlaid on the background. An example is that trees can often be replaced by images and simply rotated to always face the camera, if they're far away enough. \n\nThere are other tricks related to lighting that I'm not an expert on, but suffice it to say, there's a reason Ray Tracing hasn't been the default all this time. Games will take shortcuts with their lighting if they know in advance what kind of style they want. \n\nThen there's parallelization, or the act of doing more at once. The CPU runs code one instruction at a time, but a GPU can run millions of small programs at the same time. That's obviously great for rendering pixels, since even a small HD display can have 1080x720=777,000 pixels, and players these days want 4k displays with millions of pixels updating at 60 frames per second. \n\nGraphics aside, some logic can be done in parallel too. It's easiest to code \"first do this, then use the result to do that\", but CPUs come with multiple cores, so if the devs can separate one process from another, they can also run at the same time. \n\nThen there's better hardware, where the exact same software can just run faster because the hardware is going through it faster, or the memory takes less time to load, etc. \n\nI'm definitely missing stuff but these are three general categories where you can find big improvements across almost every game",

This can further break down into much more complicated subsystems. For example, you might optimize the way text is rendered.\n\nWith shaders and rendering, there are two methods of optimization. You either don't render something at all, or you make assumptions. So if in most situations the result of a calculation is 2, you can skip calculating 1+1 and simply say the result is 2 every time, and it will work faster and look similar in most situations (and wrong in a few). If the object or effect is not visible at all or very far away in the player's field of vision, it can be not rendered at all, or rendered in a lower quality.\n\nSome more modern techniques involve \"upscaling\", \"variable rate shading\", or \"frame generation\". \n\nUpscaling renders the game at a lower resolution, then uses complicated algorithms to reconstruct the image into as high quality as possible. \n\nFrame generation takes the previous frame that you were shown, then makes some very quick assumptions and inserts that frame between when the next one should be rendered. This increases fluidity.\n\nVariable rate shading renders different elements on screen with lower quality.

Please also note: Above water, the shrapnel flying around is the primary danger, while underwater, it's the pushing force of the uncompressed water - similar to just falling flat from above onto it. That's what makes a grenade underwater so dangerous",

Since your body has (roughly) the same density as water, the shockwave tends to travel through it more effectively, causing more damage. \n\nBut typically, the most common types of 'grenades' have a fairly low concussive force with a relatively small blast and instead, rely on 'fragments' (small pieces of metal flying at high speeds) to do injuries. In this case, water will reduce their velocity and range significantly, making them weaker and reducing their effective range. There are exceptions, the M67 grenade and thermobaric grenades tend to have larger concussive blasts than most common grenades.",

Superglue paritcles are made of monomer molecules that are quite unstable and raelly want to get triggered into rapidly chain reacting and joining with each other into long solid chains. It can be activated by water or other things. The best way to use the glue is to prepare a rough surface on both ends, so that the liquid can seep into the nooks andd cranies and hold onto them after it solidifies. So in the end you will quickly get billions (or more) of tiny interwoven chains latches into the nooks cranies on both surfaces.

Not looking after your insurance company.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of the US healthcare system in general but I would never have an HMO.\n\nTo give an example, say you go see a doctor for some pain in your elbow.\n\nPPO doctor: \"You need surgery to repair it. We'll work with your insurance company and bill you the rest.\"\n\nHMO doctor: \"This is expensive so we're going to not recommend surgery.\"",

Muscle patterns to squeeze things through the tubes in our digestive system are largely automatic. You don't need to think about flexing each part of your throat as you swallow, you just think \"swallow\".

These things exist.\n\nPeople don't use them because they're expensive and generally unnecessary.\n\nThe reason there's so much variance in how the temperature **feels** are:\n\n* Water contains a LOT of thermal energy and is very effective at transferring that energy to you. If it's 130 degrees farenheit outside, it's really hot, but you can bear it for a decent amount of time.  But 130F water?  That's dangerous.  Likewise, if it's 60F outside, that's a cool to mild day. 60F water is something that most people would find to be very cold - that temperature might be fairly mild with air, but in water you could get hypothermia if you're stuck in it for an hour.\n* This means that if water is a bit cooler than your skin, it'll feel pretty cold, and if it's a bit hotter than your skin, it'll feel pretty hot.  The temperature range for a comfortable shower for you is pretty narrow - maybe 5-10 degrees F.\n* Common simple valves just mix hot and cold water.  On any given day, either temperature could be a bit different. Maybe the water coming in to the pipe is a few degrees warmer.  Maybe your hot water heater is a bit cooler than it was the day before\n* If you're using a simple valve to mix hot and cold water that have variable temperatures, what comes out of the valve will depend on the temperature of both the hot and cold water and the position of the valve\n\n  \nWhat you're feeling with water temperatures shifting so quickly isn't because the temperature is changing drastically, *it's that there's a lot of energy in the water, and you're very sensitive to it.*\n\nAnd about the range of motion - usually, these valves go from all cold water to mostly hot water. Not everyone runs their water heater at the same temperature, so a valve position in one house might give you scalding water, and in another house could give you lukewarm water.  They could change the valve so rather than having a 1/2 turn through the whole range, but imagine if you needed to turn the valve 4-5 full rotations.  You'd get more precise control over the temperature but it'd be a pain in the butt to use.",

Although your body can tolerate a high heat range (think saunas or ice baths), your comfort range is usually around 35-40 degrees Celsius. \n\nThis means that the water on full cold comes out at 5 degrees C, at full hot comes out at 90 degrees C, and the 5 degree range that is comfortable takes up about 7% of your tap's range. Imagining a 30cm ruler, that means you need to get it somewhere within 2cm, or less than one inch in a foot for the Americans. That's not hard to do, but when it takes time to heat up, is harder to visualise, and variances in the hot or cold water out of the taps can throw it out of whack, you can see why it can be tricky to do sometimes.\n\nLike many others have said, limiting your high temp, in-line water heating, or better quality taps/pipes will yield better results and easier mixing.",

So, you agree to a \"consent decree\" stating that both parties agree you are not at fault for them breaking their hip, but you will pay for 1/2 their estimated medical bills. This agreement makes it very hard for the other person to go after you in court again for additional damages/charges, but also guarantees they get something.",

When a government's debt far exceeds the ability to pay it off, lenders are reluctant to throw more good money after the bad, and the government is basically bankrupt. Greece, whose currency is based on Euros, could no longer get any Euros becuase other countries weren't willing to lend Euros to Greece. And the Greek government made the problem worse by under-reporting their debt.\n\nThe Greek government then imposed severe austerity measures, drastically cutting programs and services in an effort to get back on track to convince the European Union to bail them out.",

Forcing your partner to live under your financial rules... that's kinda what happened.\n\nGreece in recent history has never been run in a financially sound manner.\n\nIts economy is fairly weak, unemployment is relatively high, and the country has a lot of debt. The government had a tendency of borrowing or printing money to get out of trouble.\n\nThe Greek economy had been mismanaged by a lot of governments. The nation defaulted (declared bankruptcy) multiple times in the past, and it's been joked that part of the reason they have no money is that tax evasion is the national pass-time.\n\nWhat changed is that in the early 2000's Greece managed to join the Euro zone, meaning that it adopted the Euro as its currency.\n\nHowever it was later revealed that the government cooked the books, its debt load was much higher than they claimed publicly, and they had performed a number of shady financial deals to qualify for the Euro entry.\n\nIn the short term this was a boon for Greece, but when things got bad and they were hit with the 2008 financial crisis their economy was on the verge of implosion.\n\nNormally they would have just defaulted again, but now they were in the Euro which would have meant taken down the rest of Europe's economy with it.\n\nSo Europe said 'No', loaned them a bunch of money to pay off their biggest creditors and forced them into harsh austerity measures.

Greece (or more specifically, the Greek government) did, however, default on its debt - ie it did not or could not repay money it had borrowed from others. Here I am assuming you're referring to the Greek financial crisis in the 2010s.\n\nOne problem for Greece is they are part of the European Union. Part of being in the EU is that Greece used the Euro rather than its own domestic currency. One aspect of adopting the Euro is that the country could no longer issue money (ie Euro). The control and issuance of Euro is controlled by the ECB (European Central Bank).\n\nGreece had undergone significant economic expansion in the prior years and their government had borrowed a lot. The Greek government had a generous pension policy and a rather large civil service. On top of that, the government had rather lax tax collection system (many businesses and individuals did not pay or underpaid income taxes). As a result the government had to borrow a lot of money every year. \n\nAt the time of the crisis, essentially borrowers were no longer willing to lend money so easily to Greece. The government had to raise interest rates to attract lenders and this led to even more money outflow from the government. This was made worse because of the global financial crisis a few years earlier meant that banks had suffered large losses and were unwilling to lend generally.\n\nThe Greek government was at huge risk of default in 2010 (ELI5). Major European governments and the IMF stepped in to provide emergency funds to Greece but these funds came with certain requirements (very unpopular for Greek citizens). The IMF required Greece to reduce spending, cut the civil service and reduce pension benefits etc. This, however, was not entirely successful. In 2015, Greek finally did default on their loans from the IMF.\n\nFor Greek citizens, pension fundings were reduced, pension payments were curtailed (stricter work requirements etc) and civil service was shrunk (many people were fired from government jobs). On top of that, private firms suffered too as the economy shrunk. High(er) unemployment and quite a lot of economic hardship for Greek citizens.\n\nOne underreported issue is that Greece was a fairly poor country by European standards in the 1980s. It had low productivity and low industrial base relative to their European neighbors. Private businesses were not willing to pay German level salaries to Greek workers who were not efficient. This impacted the private economy as basically Greece had low levels of investment and employment. To offset this, the government expanded civil service jobs and offered generous pensions to keep their citizens happy (politically the Greek government had swung pretty far left in the 2000s)",

You can easily give this task to 100 people and complete it in the time it takes one person to fold 100 envelopes.\n\nConsider this second job: fold a single piece of paper into an origami fighter jet. You can't easily split this job so your completion time entirely depends on how fast one worker does origami.\n\nThat's one part to it. The second part is latency — the time it takes workers to communicate with each other, similar to administrative overhead. Going back to the envelope folding example: when your 100 workers are done with their jobs, they will run to you and give you their envelopes; each one takes you a liiittle time to process, but you can handle 100 workers just fine. Now imagine giving the work to 1000 workers instead — you get the idea, at some point it's not worth it.",

If the city is bigger, you could theoretically fit more venues (components), but the people (electrical pulses) will have to travel further to reach their intended destination. This results in a lower efficiency as those people/pulses take longer to cycle between all the venues/components they need to access for the day.\n\nMiniaturization is a major part of what helps a computer run faster as we can't increase the speed electricity travels at but we can reduce the length of the pathways it needs to travel.\n\nUnfortunately, at some point those pathways become too small for us to handle the heat and interference (people in the town running in to each other because the sidewalk is too narrow) and the entire system becomes unstable. This was the \"Death of Moore's Law\", where we are unable to continue to reduce the size of the computer components while maintaining stability and keeping the computer from cooking itself to death.\n\nAdding more of the existing types of components (more cache, additional data lines for more electrical pulses to flow through etc) may help a computer process more data (money and products) in a given \"cycle\" (one day in the town), but it comes at a potential cost of that cycle running slower as the pulses have to travel further (since you need to add space to fit those additional components), and thus you can't run as many cycles in the same amount of time.\n\nWhile you could potentially find new types of components that might optimise how a specific task is performed (example: Ray-tracing cores on the newest graphic cards), these kinds of enhancements are very hard to find, rarely apply to all use-cases, are expensive to introduce and typically don't require a huge increase in the size of the overall computer to add anyway.",

Electrons move at the speed of light, but that is still a finite value so longer runs take more time.  \n\nOn the other hand, if we define a computer as simply \"the box that contains all of the thinking rocks\", then we have different issues.  In this case, each CPU/RAM combination is a singular compute unit.  Well, I can build a massive backplane that can accept some number of these individual compute units.  2 compute units are more powerful than one, even though they run at the same speeds, because they can do 2 things at once instead of one.  4 compute units are faster than that and 8 are faster still.  The box all of this is in just needs to be big enough to contain everything and still be able to move enough air to keep everything cool.  In theory, this extends more or less to infinity.  The more compute units you add, the more powerful you get and the box needs to be a bit bigger.  In reality, you reach a point where you need to come up with a way to keep everything in sync, but that's a software problem.  Intel built a supercomputer a couple of decades ago in exactly this way.  \n\nIn short, there really is no point at which physical size fails to enable increased performance.  However, as you scale up everything gets more expensive to build AND harder to manage.  So there IS a practical upper limit based on cost and manageability.",

The technology itself is not the big problem.\n\nIt is relatively simple (so to speak) to make engines that run on hydrogen. And it is somewhat feasible to design cars that can carry hydrogen as a fuel. This is a bit of an engineering challenge but eminently solvable.\n\nBut that fuel needs to come from somewhere and it needs to be distributed efficiently so that these cars can access the fuel. And this is where the major drawbacks of hydrogen come in.\n\na) No country has a distribution network for hydrogen. Hydrogen reacts with many metals making the metal brittle, it takes up a LOT of volume in gas form. The only reasonably practical way to transport hydrogen widely is to compress it at very high pressure. Well this is a lot more costly because everything must now be strong enough to withstand the pressures and there are major safety concerns. This means compressors and pumps, high pressure pipes, high pressure container ships, high pressure tanker trucks, high pressure storage tanks etc etc. And this has to be in a scale large enough to cover a country. \n\nb) Hydrogen gas is not widely available on earth. There is a lot of hydrogen bound up in natural gas, crude oils, water, plants, animals and soils but that means there needs to be a means to obtain hydrogen through some high volume process using something else as a raw material. Well this process is almost certainly very energy intensive and requires major investments. The simplest and cheapest method is likely to use natural gas but that process itself almost certainly has to release carbon dioxide. Electrolysis using water as a source is super energy intensive and the world just doesn't have enough energy infrastructure to do this on a wide scale. This would require a huge (really really huge!) investment in power generation and this additional energy cannot be obtained using fossil fuels or it misses the whole point.",

In a completely fair 1 on 1 Blackjack game, you and the other player would make your decisions simultaneously, either with both sides hidden, or with each round of hit/stay done at the same time. If both players bust, it's a draw.\n\nBut in player vs dealer, your bust is always a loss, and the dealer gets to make his decisions with your full play in view. If you stay on a 12 and the dealer has a 13, the dealer wins without having to hit, so you have to take riskier hits in hopes of beating the dealer's eventual hand.\n\nThese are small edges, but over many hands they add up and the house wins more than it loses on average.\n\nAs for the second question about multiple decks: There are advanced strategies that people have developed to help gain an edge back over the house, known as \"card counting\". Basically, if you watch what cards have been played across several hands, you can keep track of numbers that are more or less likely to show up in the remainder of the deck. In single-deck blackjack, there are 16 cards with a value of 10, 4 eights, 4 nines. If you notice a higher than average number of those cards have already been seen versus a lower number of low-value cards, it can become safer to hit in the teens without risking a bust. By the flipside, if you notice that there's a lot of higher value cards left in the deck you can play more conservatively and better estimate when the dealer is going to bust. There's whole systems involving multiple coordinated players who can \"scout\" tables to find ones where the distribution is \"hot\", at which point another player can come in and make larger bets to take advantage.\n\nIn order to combat this advantage, the house will create a \"shoe\" of decks shuffled together. The more decks used and the lower the \"penetration\" (number of cards seen before the whole shoe is shuffled), the harder it becomes to count cards enough to gain an edge.",

The dealer however always have to take another card unless they have over 16 and can never take another card at 17 or higher (in some casinos the dealer will take another card if it has 17 if one of them is an ace that is currently 11, this rule increases the house edge).\n\nGenerally blackjack is the highest return game in the casino.

If the casino is very player friendly the return can be as high as 99.9%.\n\nThe main problem for casinos is that with card counting the player can actually obtain an edge (as in over 100% average return).

Everything else is determined by those two things, and the level of excitation is temporary and will drop as the atom radiates energy.\n\n\nThe number of electrons must be equal to the number of protons. The number of neutrons is determined by the number of protons as well, since they are needed to bind the nucleus together, but are unstable if there are more than needed. If an atom has too many or too few neutrons it will decay (this might take a long time, but it's why we can use carbon-14 for dating). \n\n\nMeanwhile, the position of every particle in the atom is determined by a wave function, which has discreet parameters, and no two particles can have the same parameters. This basically means that any atom has specific \"slots\" that must be filled, from lowest to highest, as you add particles. A particle can temporarily jump to a higher slot, but that represents a higher energy state, so it won't be stable there.\n\n\nAn oxygen atom's structure isn't more \"complex\" than lithium, it just has more protons. As complex as electron orbitals may appear, they are literally the simplest way to arrange electrons in an atom that is physically possible.\n\n\nSo the only thing that matters in terms of nature's preferred for creating one atom over another is how much binding energy the nucleus has, which is determined by a balance between the strong nuclear force (the force that \"glues\" protons and neutrons together at very short range) and the electric force (protons repelling each other because they have a positive charge). And this binding energy goes up until you reach iron, which is why we have so much of it.",

If they find the game fun they're far more like to stayed absorbed, learn and dedicate additional hours to become advanced, in comparison to say a regular school subject. \n\nMany of these kids are geniuses in the making, and likely will have the potential to have successful careers in other fields due to their intelligence, its just due to the circumstances I've listed its easier for their intelligence to manifest early in the game of chess. Additionally, chess is a competitive game with media coverage. A child prodigy will spark attention and get noticed more than a child who's extremely intelligent and successful in a less exciting field.",

So ultimately, a kid which follows a successful strategy (using the knowledge of experts) will have a major starting advantage over an adults who did not learn those patterns - and has to respond to those moves on the fly, often unser time pressure.\n\nFrom there on the game \"snowballs\", it's either to leverage an advantage in chess, than to catch up to it.",

(Pre chess boom inflation that was pretty strong). \n\nChess is mainly memorization and pattern recognition. In popular culture, chess is seen as intellectual, but it's nothing special once you understand it. Children or adults can both learn. \n\nThere are around 33 mainstream openings. Each has known theory on the best move and best counter. Players memorize the best 20+ book moves in advance. Anyone willing to put in effort can do this, including children. Children have an advantage of time, and not needing to work day jobs (there is no money in chess unless you're in the top 20 in the world lol)\n\nOnce you leave theory, you reach the mid-game. This is centered on pattern recognition and developed through doing puzzles. I did 1-2 hours of puzzle a day when I was competing, and 1-2 hours of theory and memorization. My school team had a coach and we practiced regularly.\n\nOnce you reach the endgame, it is back to theory. I believe under 7 pieces on the board and chess is solved with all perfect moves known. Kids are notoriously bad at end game prep as it's boring to study. Most prefer strong memorized openings so adult players will try and drag kids into complex endgames since it's a common weakness.\n\nI lost interest in chess when I was in highschool because obviously doing 2-4 hours of chess study a day got depressing and I still wasn't that successful in tournaments. Combine harder school work + social reasons and I stopped playing as a child. I'm now mid 1300's elo in blitz online and mainly play for fun.",

If you could somehow keep your arm bent and release the ball like that, that would work (and some bowlers - usually slower spin ones - have used their body mechanics and double jointed effectively to be able to do that). But effectively, for bowling fast, that essentially boils down to keeping your arm straight and using the momentum and javelin-like action to bowl the ball fast.\n\nCricket also doesn’t prioritize bowling fast as much as pitching does. There’s a whole class of bowlers who only bowl the ball around 50-70mph using guile and trickery with the ball bouncing off the surface to be effective. Also, even some fast bowlers sacrifice some of their speed to be able to bowl for longer during a game and also get more control over where they’re placing the ball. Some bowlers have actually gotten worse after increasing their speed because they lost their control and gave up more runs because of it. \n\nEssentially, bowling faster doesn’t automatically translate to better bowling in cricket. Cricket doesn’t prioritize speed as much as baseball does because there are other factors to consider. In baseball, speed matters way more. Therefore, the athletes prioritize other things and the athletes that succeed are also better at these other things",

Baseball pitchers have learned a throwing technique that uses a lot of muscles at once to contribute to the effort, making all the above motions, A, B, C, and D, happen at the same time.

We get rid of feelings we don't like, perhaps we feel anxious, overwhelmed, feel as if we may fail or something else. We don't like this feeling. But what did we learn in the past? Ah, if I just do X instead of the thing I have to do, I can get rid of the feeling. Getting rid of it in the short term feels very nice, we experience a relief from stress, anxiety or whatever plagued us, great! In the long term though, we didn't finish the task and the feeling will come back stronger. But wait, what did we learn how to get rid of the bad feeling? Ah, yeah, just do X instead of Y. Ah  there it is again, the relief. In the long term it has negative consequences through and we have to avoid these feelings again, and again, and again. \n\nIt is a form of regulating our emotions and not the best one, a \"maladaptive\" one. It used to work well in a given context where we learned it but now it hinders us to make progress.\n\nOur brain loves the shot term reward, especially if we get rid of something bad by avoiding it. You can reinforce behavior (make said behavior more likely in the future) by giving something positive - a reward (think of the dog and the treat for giving its paw) or by removing something negative - perhaps you don't have to do chores for a week because you made your homework. Both is a reinforcement and makes your behavior more likely. Avoiding the task by whatever you do to procrastinate is the latter.\n\n(There is also stuff that makes behavior less likely, called punishment by adding something we don't like - a punch, insult, criticism or removing something we like - didn't do homework? No PS5 for a week. Both makes behavior less likely in the future.)\n\nTL;DR - remove unpleasant feeling by procrastinating - feels nice in the short term. This is a reward, we learn to do it again. Long term not so nice, negative consequences, makes new unpleasant feelings. But we learned how to remove unpleasant feelings in the short term by procrastinating -  we do it again.\n\nYou learned to make pleasant feelings - but not by doing what you need to do but by something else (creating cheats, videos, imagining success, etc.). This is a direct reward short term.",

Those bacteria then acidify the meat, and that further controls bad bacterial growth. Cured meat producers closely monitored the pH, and it has to get down below a certain pH value within a short period of time for it to remain safe. \n\nThe problem is that a curing meat culture is tightly sealed, and very quickly becomes oxygen-free, and therefore a potential substrate for growth of the botulism bacteria. And botulism is no fooling around with serious. If there is botulism in your food and you eat it, it will kill you.\n\nIt turns out that nitrates inhibit the botulism bacteria though. So nitrates are included in salt cured meats, specifically to prevent the growth of some extremely harmful bacteria that cause things like botulism. \n\nHow serious is the actual risk if you leave it out? There's a lot of argument about that, and it almost certainly depends on how good a job you do producing the cured meat and getting it acidified fast enough. \n\nBut it's a hell of a risk, and that's why nitrates are required in commercial cured meats, then why nitrates from celery salt are required in \"uncured\" meats.",

        "body": "To take a bit of a step back from specifically cured meats and talking more about why they were advertised as cured in the past and uncured today (which I think is what your question actually is), it's a difference in customer perception in different eras.\n\nIn previous years, starting around the Industrial Revolution and continuing for a few decades after that, the general customer perception of small businesses is that many would cut corners to save on costs without a real care to the product being delivered to consumers.   There were not widespread regulations ensuring quality and safe products making it to the market, and even if there were there would be little way of enforcing them in the era logistically.  As such, buying products from a small business was very much a case of *caveat emptor*.  A good business would deliver a good product, a poor business would deliver a shoddy product, and a bad business could even deliver a health hazardous product, particularly when it came to food.\n\nWhen industrialization happened, what this meant in the perception of consumers is that they wouldn't need to deal with corrupt/lazy/oblivious small businesses anymore.  They could get a mass manufactured product with predictable quality at any time they desired, and even if it might not be quite as high quality as the very best small businesses, there was no chance of a poor quality product and absolutely no chance of a hazardous product.  Many consumers were willing to take this trade-off, and the fact that these industrialized products was a selling point for these products, indicating that the customer would not have to worry about unscrupulous production processes.\n\nThe difference now is that since that era of trust in big business we've had many decades of time pass.  All of the corrupt or poor small businesses of the past eventually went defunct, leaving only the good ones behind.  New small businesses that started since then had to adhere to the high standard required to stay in business or go under themselves.  We've also had 50+ years of aggregate news stories about health crises that have arises in various food processing facilities.  Chemicals getting spilled in places, unhygenic manufacturing conditions, disease outbreaks, and this is before we even get to the years upon years of gradual enshittification that inevitably happens in an entrenched capitalist business.  Now many industrialized manufacturers, particularly food manufacturers, have the some reputation that bad small business had during the Industrial Revolution era, while the small businesses (now artisanal businesses) that have survived or opened since then instead have the reputation of being the higher quality product.  And so now big manufacturers are trying to advertise themselves as have the same standards and manufacturing methods as artisanal businesses.\n\nTL;DR Big companies are changing their advertising strategies over the years to match where public interest is.  Public interest has shifted because few, if any, people remember how bad things were before industrialization standardized safe and hygienic manufacturing processes.\n\nP.S.

Hence they share the pronunciation of \"on\", which is distinct from the etymology and pronunciation of \"one\".\n\nNote that \"one\" and \"once\" share an origin as well (they both derive from the Anglo-Saxon \"an\", which meant \"one\", but which split into \"a/an\" for the indefinite article and \"one\" for the number), so if we're counting those, we should also count things like \"oneness\" and \"oneself\". The only word that *is* derived from this source which isn't pronounced that way is, ironically, \"only\" itself, which came from Anglo-Saxon *anlic*, literally, \"one-like\".",

It does not work well for hardware. If you get your hands on a piece of executable code, you can test it and write your own code that does roughly the same things. Even if it is developed in a different language using a different operating system, it will broadly do what it is supposed to. Heck, it might even work better than the original.\n\nAs for hardware: You can buy a piece of hardware, disassemble it, and measure its dimensions. You can test the material in a chemistry lab to figure out its composition. But this exercise will not reveal to you:\n\n* The manufacturing process used to create the material. Two materials with identical chemical composition can have slightly different properties if the manufacturing processes used to manufacture them are different.\n* Manufacturing process used to create the components out of raw material.\n* Specific machine tools used in manufacturing and their capabilities.\n* Design tolerances.\n* Test processes, methodologies, and tools used to make sure things work as required.\n\nDoing all of the above requires significant amount of expertise and experience. Which means to copy a competitor you have to be a pretty good at that technology yourself. And even if you get a good handle on all of the above, there might still be an X-factor, a trade secret, that you will not be able to figure out. Finally, know-how that is valuable to a company is often protected by patents to prevent others from copying or just simply covered up as trade secrets. In case of hardware of military importance, everything is a “top secret” and no one other than a few select people know about it.\n\nNow, let us say you want to reverse engineer the GE F-110 engine from an F-16. Where will get one? But if you wanted to reverse engineer a P&W JT8D from a Boeing 737, presumably you will have to buy a B-737 and then take the engine apart. If you have enough money, you could do all that but how can you reverse engineer the engine unless you have significant expertise in engine technology to begin with? (I don’t know that P&W would sell a single engine to someone who has no justification why they need the engine.)\n\nBTW competitors buying each others’ products to take them apart and see what they are doing is a very common practice in the world. Many times companies even set up front companies to buy competition’s products. But this practice is possible in the commercial world. In the military world, almost everything is a closely guarded secret … a matter of life and death.\"\n\nEnd Quote",

        "body": "Imagine i have 100 coins and i flip all of them randomly. There are a total of 2^100 different heads/tails patterns possible (a lot). You can imagine that flipping all of them is equivalent to picking any one of the 2^100 at random. \n\nI can now measure the number of heads and tails for all 2^100 possible patterns. Then i may ask, how many patterns have say 60 heads and 40 tails. Or how many have 50heads 50tails.\n\nThere is only one that is all heads and one that is all tails. Mathematically. 100/0 contains only one pattern. 50 heads and 50 tails has the most possible realizations. You can thus say that out of all ratios, its most likely to get a pattern that is 50/50 heads tails. Its not more likely than all the others combined because 49/51 is also quite likely but less so. Its just most likely out if all individually. 100/0 is least likely. We call any specific pattern (heads, tails, tails, heads, …, tails) for example a “microstate”. We call just the ratio in thus case the “macrostate”. The macrostate 50/50 has the most microstates so its most likely. \n\nEntropy literally means, the number of microstates in a macrostate. So in random processes the chances are highest that the system goes to a macrostate with high entropy (high number of microstates).\n\nNotice that the heads tails pattern: heads/tails/heads/tails etc in sequence in this example is considered a microstate corresponding with a high entropy state even though the pattern to us looks very structured. But remember, entropy depends on how we define unique macrostates. In this case we only looked at the number of heads vs tails when defining the macrostate category, NOT the ordering so this “regularity” is lost. We may include it in our category of different macrostates and then it might become low entropy. It just depends on how we group microstates in macrostates.\n\nSo for gasses where molecules move around randomly. If we differentiate macrostates by measuring how many molecules occupy certain regions in a box, the states where the molecules are nicely distributed are more likely because there are more ways the mulecules may distribute themselves in a distributed fashion. It becomes hard however to count them if molecules may occupy uncountably many different locations. But that is the hard part of statistical mechanics",

There’s a left side and a right side.\n\nYou start by putting all six on the left. There’s only one way to put all six on the left. One combination. Low entropy.\n\nI ask you to take one ball from the left and place it on the right.\n\n“Which one?” You might ask.\n\nWell there are 6 different ways to do it aren’t there? In one version, you pick the red ball. In another, you pick the green ball, and so on. There are six combination. Slightly higher entropy.\n\nOkay let’s reset. All the balls go in the left again. Now take two balls and put it on the right. How many ways can you think of to do this?\n\nYou can do red/orange. You could do red/yellow. You could do yellow/violet. There’s 15 ways to do it. Count them if you want. 15 combinations. Even higher entropy.\n\nWhat about three balls on each side. How many versions of that can you do? There’s 20. This is the highest entropy for this problem. It’s the most disorganized you can make the system.\n\nCompared to lowest entropy when it was really organized (all on one side).\n\nSo while entropy isn’t exactly calculated this way in physics, it’s a good starting point. Entropy is a “state function” which is a fancy way of saying it’s a measurement of how something is at an exact moment. More specifically, entropy is a state function that measures the state of disarray or how unorganized the system is. The analogy I used earlier shows how you might measure this disarray in a way that matches the entropy formula.\n\nThe importance of this is that over time, we expect entropy to increase. This sort of makes sense. Remove the barrier in the box so that the balls can freely move. You can start with all of them on one side, but naturally, they’ll probably spread out. You could probably get them back to one side, but you’ll have to put in some energy to do it (tilt the box, push the balls with your hand, etc.)\n\nIf you measure the entropy according to physics, we notice that it either stays a constant unchanging value or it increases, depending on if the barriers allow for movement. What we are astounded by is that it never decreases on its own in a consistent or significant way. Either it stays the same or increases.\n\nNow let’s do the universe. The universe can have its entropy measured and it’s certainly a system where objects are free to move, and so its entropy always increases. The fact that entropy cannot decrease means that we can use entropy as a measurement of time. It’s a state function that serves as a time stamp. Entropy might be the arrow of time itself.\n\nEven when you have a system where the entropy seems like it’s decreasing, say you’re organizing your room, something else needs to increase its entropy to allow that to happen, in this case the entropy of your body and the appliances you use to clean your room. As a matter of fact, the increase in entropy outweighs the decrease in entropy of your room so the overall effect is that entropy increases, which makes sense because time has to move forward.\n\nThere’s more to it. But hopefully now there’s a more tangible concept on your mind about what it means.\n\nSource: I am a physics teacher, but I also stole the analogy from Chris Ferrie, who wrote a book called Statistical Physics for Babies, which goes over entropy as the main topic. The statistical physics interpretation of entropy is also very fascinating. The idea is that the universe is a constant die roll and things just trend towards the most likely scenarios. High entropy is a highly likely scenario, since there are more versions of it than low entropy, and so over time, the dice rolls of the universe give rise to trends like entropy always increasing, potentially explaining away forces and laws as simply a product of statistics.",

The first is the base clock this is almost always 100MHz generated from a quartz crystal, this gets fed into the CPU which contains a frequency multiplier as the name suggests this outputs a multiplied frequency (I had a quick peek at the Arrandale datasheet but I cant actually see how the multiplier works it says its a \"Phase locked loop\" but IDK what that is maybe someone can add it in a comment). There is another step where the CPU is duty cycled, this means that it may run for 40 clocks and then stop for 100.

Then it sends the same sorts of signals to actually *critical* parts of the OS, such as the file-browsing process. Finally, when all but the very last bits are done, it sends instructions which close off those *and itself*, leaving only a final instruction to the processor to terminate operations. Once that signal is sent, the processor basically says \"okay, no more power, we're done\". Some minimal amount of power is still present (you can see this with the little light/s on your motherboard), but the system is functionally deactivated.\n\nA device reboots automatically by giving a different kind of instruction, which instead of ceasing all operations, it tells the motherboard's systems to go into \"restart\" mode. All of the stuff loaded into memory (which includes the OS) is unloaded etc., but the board never *stops*--it just resets all non-permanent storage (meaning, both your hard drive and the firmware on its chips). Then it begins the boot cycle, just as if you had started it up from being offline entirely.\n\nSoftware does not control the clock. The clock is controlled by firmware, which is not software, but instead long-term-stored information on the actual *chips* of the motherboard itself. Firmware can be updated (which is why it is \"softer\" than \"hardware\"), but it's meant to stay relatively unchanged (which is why it's \"harder\" than \"software\"). The firmware interacts with a special circuit, the clock generator, which can be tuned by settings in the BIOS (\"Basic Input-Output System\", the interface which allows you to choose settings for the firmware) to specific clock speeds. Adjusting your BIOS settings to have a faster clock speed is called \"overclocking\"--often it wears out the parts slightly faster, but causes them to do more work, so if you don't overdo it, you can get more performance without buying a more-expensive chip.",

There are many circuits, and one will be always powered. The job of this circuit is to wait for a button to be pressed, and that will power on the rest of the circuits that actually power the CPU and the rest of the computer.  It's a very low-power circuit, think of a TV that's always plugged in, waiting for you to turn it on (all modern TVs are built with computers inside them).\n\nCPUs are connected to the motherboard, and the motherboard is connected to the PSU with a specific connector. A lot of the wires or \"lines\" on the connector provide power to the board, but one of them is used by the motherboard to signal to the PSU to shut down, the PS-ON# line.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PS-ON_Signal\n\nThe operating system communicates through the motherboard to tell the PSU to go back to the low-power state after a shutdown completes.\n\nA reboot is just a shutdown with a command to restart the boot process. This is probably done in the BIOS.\n\nBasically the first thing that boots in a computer is the BIOS. It sets up everything then hands over execution to the OS. When rebooting, execution is handed back to the BIOS, which simply boots into the OS again.\n\nThe clock is circuitry on the CPU (the actual die) that sends a signal to the rest of the computer. It usually has a base internal frequency, and from that additional circuitry can generate other frequencies needed by other parts of the computer.\n\nIt's used to keep things in sync and actually drive computation. When the clock cycles, i.e. changes from high to low, or 1 to 0, this drives circuits to change their state, and these changes ripple through the CPU. Without the clock, nothing would change in the CPU and it would be \"frozen\".\n\nWith older CPUs with external clock circuitry, you can actually control the clock with a simple on/off switch and \"see\" the CPU step through the program with each cycle.",

Let’s break it down in a simple and detailed way\n\nImagine the Elevator is Like a School Bus\n\nThink of the elevator like a school bus going up and down a building to pick people up. People on each floor press a button to tell the elevator they want a ride, just like kids waving at a bus to stop.\n\nThe Elevator Has a Brain (a Computer)\n\nThe elevator has a little brain (a computer) that decides which floor to go to next. It wants to be fast and efficient—like a smart bus driver who doesn't want to waste time or gas.\n\nHere’s What the Elevator Thinks About:\n\n1. What Direction Am I Going?\n\nIf the elevator is going up, it tries to pick up everyone going up before turning around.\n\nIf it’s going down, it picks up people who want to go down first.\n\n\n\n2. Who Pressed the Button First?\n\nUsually, it tries to help the people who pressed the button first, but only if they are on the way.\n\n\n\n3. Are You On the Way?\n\nThe elevator doesn’t jump all around. It goes in order—like 2 → 3 → 5 if it’s going up.\n\nIt won’t skip floor 3 to go to floor 6 unless 6 is more urgent or 3 didn’t press the button.\n\n\n\n4. After It Reaches the Top or Bottom, It Turns Around\n\nOnce it’s done going up, it turns around and helps people going down (or vice versa).\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\nLet’s say:\n\nFloor 2 wants to go up.\n\nFloor 5 wants to go down.\n\nThe elevator is on Floor 1, going up.\n\n\nWhat happens?\n\nIt stops at Floor 2 because that’s next and the person wants to go up—same direction!\n\nIt doesn’t stop at Floor 5 (yet) because that person wants to go down, and the elevator is still going up.\n\nAfter going up and dropping people off, it will come back down and pick up Floor 5.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nElevators go in one direction at a time.\n\nThey pick people going the same way they are.\n\nThey stop in order (2, 3, 4…) if those people want to go in that direction.\n\nWhen they reach the end, they turn around and help people going the other way.",

These are both remembrances of antic cultures. Babylonian culture used base-60 number system and they also happened to be very good at astrology. European culture inherited the base-60 part of our timekeeping from there, but also that's why we have 360 degrees in a circle (6x60).      \n\nEgyptian and Greek cultures loved the number 12, it was considered a \"sacred\" number. You can see 12 throughout ancient cultures, think of the 12 apostles, 12 music notes, etc. 13 is the bad number since ancient times because it breaks everything that's cool about 12.       \nBoth of these cultures divided day and night each into 12 parts. They also divided the sky into 12 parts that's why we have 12 months (a month for each sky bit).       \n\nGreeks united the base-60 system with base-12, that's why we have 60 minutes in an hour.     \n\nThe name hour comes from the ancient Roman ora which derived from a more ancient Greek word meaning year but as well season. So basically the idea of an ora can be followed as if 'ora' is s season of a year, then 'ora' could as well be the season of a day, because both are 1/12 parts.       \n\nMinute means \"small\" in Latin. It came into use as a time measure with mechanic clocks which coincides with the industrial revolution. (Before that, keeping track of minutes were anyways unnecessary.) The idea is that when clocks came into use, the 1/60 part of an hour was called \"pars minuta prima\", meaning \"the first small part\". So you chop the hour once into 60s, it's the first little thing. If you further chop the already chopped thing, that's the second little thing (the little part of the little thing). In Latin, \"pars minuta seconda\".      \n\nSo you see, we could call them prima and seconda, but people are not logical when they abbreviate. From the first sentence (pars minuta prima) we kept minutes, and from the second sentence we kept seconds.      \n\nThat's the story.",

I taught about it a few times and never found an answer but it may have something to do with how people use to count with their hands. People use to cound on one hand by pointing their thumb to each phalanges of the fingers of the same hand. You can point/count 12 with one hand. That might explain why 12 is a number that is kinda special (dozen, 12hrs on a clock etc.). If you count to twelve with one hand using this method and use the fingers (5) on your other hand to count how many times you reach 12, you can count to 60 (5x12).

These numbers are called \"highly composite numbers\", because they aren't just composite (meaning, they have at least three distinct divisors), they're VERY composite, having more divisors than any number smaller than them. In order, the first few highly composite numbers are 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 120, 180, 240, 360, ...\n\nBut 60 is in a special class even within these, a set called the \"*superior* highly composite numbers\". The specific thing that makes them \"superior\" is a bit advanced for ELI5, but TL;DR: these numbers don't just have a lot of divisors, they have a *specially high* amount of divisors in a rigorous and technical sense. The first few superior highly composite numbers are 2, 6, 12, 60, 120, 360, 720, ...\n\nYou'll notice that there are 360 *degrees* in a circle, and 360 is *also* a superior highly composite number. That's by design. 360 degrees means we can chop up a circle into a LOT of fractions very easily: half (180°), third (120°), fourth (90°), fifth (72°), sixth (60°), eighth (45°), ninth (40°), tenth (36°), and twelfth (30°) are all very easy, and several smaller fractions too.\n\nFurther, consider how many seconds there are in an *hour*, rather than in a minute: 60x60 = 3600. 3600 is *also* a highly composite number (albeit not a *superior* one), and now HO BOY we can cut it up into a ZILLION different fractions because we get all of the above PLUS all of them divided into tenths (e.g. twentieths, thirtieths, fiftieths, etc.)!\n\nThis is why these systems developed--alongside many other pre-modern measuring systems. They made it easy to cut things up into smaller chunks. That's why volumes in American Customary units are done almost entirely by powers of 2, because it's really easy to estimate how big half of something is, and it's even easier to double something by just...using the same scoop/vessel twice.",

The more current you are putting through it, the faster the lithium ions move to the anode.\n\n\n>If too many lithium ions move over in a span of time and cannot settle into their new home, they will turn into lithium metal and stay put forever.\n\n\n>When the battery is mostly empty, there is tons of room on the anode for Li ions. They can head over and find a vacancy anywhere they look. There is no hindrance to charging and you can go at the max rated current for the battery. This is CC charging. The constant current is the battery's rated current.\n\n\n>After the battery gets about 80% full, it gets harder for Li ions to find a vacancy on the anode. If you kept them coming at max speed they would bottleneck trying to find a place to settle in. And some of them would metalize, forever removing them and whatever part of the anode they're covering from ever being used again.\n\n\n>So you need to slow down the current based on how full the battery is. The fewer vacancies are left, the slower you have to go. This is the CV charging. By maintaining a constant voltage, the current reduces based on how full the battery is.",

When you have a large group of pack animals working together, being able to predict the other members of the pack can be really advantageous, both in terms of coordinating hunting and such, and in terms of manipulating the group for your own advantage. If you can imagine what other people are thinking and what they might do, its easier to maneuver yourself into good positions and get access to more food and better mates. This adaptation kind of snowballed until it got to the point that our imagination turned into something which could be used for complex abstract reasoning. We were then able to leverage that ability for new uses, like making complicated tools, harnessing fire, advanced communication, reading and writing, etc.\n\nOne thing to note is that depending on your definition of 'advanced', humans aren't necessarily the most advanced species on the planet. Ants for instance can have cities of millions that all get along perfectly, where humans would fight and crime on each other.",

Many are also social and communicative.

Well, we have a number of adaptations that allow us to do those things:\n\n- good senses, notably good eyesight -> allows us to evaluate and interact our surrounding environment in several ways, from both near and far\n\n- hands -> these intricate appendages allow us to manipulate our environment with fine control\n\n- Fine motor control in our appendages -> not only do we have hands that we can use to manipulate small stuff, but we have a level of fine motor control with our larger appendages that allow us to do things like throw objects, and interact very preci\n\n- Teeth and digestive system -> we have a *very* broad range of foods we can survive on\n\n- sociability -> it can't be understated how important it is that humans like to form groups, it allows individuals to specialize in different types of environmental manipulation without sacrificing the overall group's ability to survive\n\n- language -> maybe the greatest adaptation we have, it allows large group formation and coordination, it allows for highly complex hierarchy, and critically it allows us to pass information both at great distance and large time intervals (i.e. passing information between generations with writing).\n\n- long lifespan -> humans live very long compared to most animals, and that allows us to learn and fine tune skills over long time periods so that we can get really good at them\n\nWhy are humans the *only* species that has become so advanced? Well, other animals are missing some of these critical adaptations.\n\n- Many birds are highly intelligent, are social, and have adaptable diets. Some even have what could be called language or maybe proto-language. But they don't have an appendage like hands that can manipulate their environment with fine control. They can use basic tools with their beaks, but can't create new tools.\n\n- Chimpanzees and other primates have hands, but don't have language. Their Critically, *they don't ask questions*. They also don't have the fine motor control that we have, which prevents them from being able to make complex tools.\n\n- Octopi are intelligent, have adaptable diets, have appendages that can manipulate their environments with fine control, plus good senses. But they're not social and they don't live very long.\n\n- Whales don't have appendages with which they can easily manipulate their environment\n\nAll of those things are pretty critical, and humans are really the only species that has all of them.

Because it seems to me that a lot of these responses assume you're talking about YouTube music playing on a different device. That's why at least a couple of people are talking about how machine learning enables this. If the music's playing on your own phone, it's considerably simpler in concept. Your phone knows the exactly what it's outputting in terms of sound. It can remove that signal from its microphone input. \n\nAnd because it knows the exact waveform it needs to subtract, it doesn't require sophisticated machine learning or anything to do that. The naive way to do it would be to simply subtract the speaker signal from the microphone signal at the same time. But that won't quite work because it does take some time for the sound to travel from the phone speaker to the phone microphone. So one additional layer is to just do the math on how fast sound travels and how far apart they are, and shift the subtraction. Instead of subtracting the speaker output from the microphone input at the same time, you wait about 300 microseconds or whatever is appropriate for your phone and subtract the speaker signal from 300 microseconds ago from the microphone signal. (300 microseconds is how long it takes sound to travel 10 cm / 4 inches, so the offset would probably be 300 microseconds or less).\n\nOf course even that isn't perfect, because sound doesn't just travel directly from speaker to microphone. It also reverberates off of your surroundings. So if you really wanted to be good at subtracting the speaker output from the microphone input, you would actually do a bunch of tests where the phone is in different physical environments, like a small room and a big room and outdoors and right next to your head and sitting on a table and so on. So then you can figure out what a particular frequency does when emitted from the speaker and returning to the microphone under all those different conditions. The thing is that the various frequencies will all be affected in different ways by the different operating conditions. You can't just use the same adjustment for every frequency. So you would have different responses to the different operating conditions and you would have to do the math on the output signal to adjust it and then subtract it from the microphone input. \n\nThat might sound complicated, and it kind of is, but it's not as complicated as you might expect. Remember, the phone knows exactly what it's putting out through the speaker. And because the way the frequencies are affected by the environment is different between one environment and another, the phone just has to listen for a brief amount of time to figure out which kind of adjustment it should apply.\n\nAnd all of this can be done through a combination of a small number of experiments and the fundamental equations. You don't actually need what people think of when they say machine learning these days. \n\nYou can just do a test with a given phone in a few backgrounds",

Copyright lasts the life of the author plus + 70 years (or 95 years from date of publication in the case of work-for-hire). The character, artwork, and stories of Iron Man comics are copyrighted by Marvel Comics.\n\n* **Trademarks** cover words, phrases, or symbols/logos used to represent a product, service, or business. There are two types of trademarks, registered (®) and unregistered (™) that offer different levels of protection. Trademarks can last as long as the company continues to use them. Companies that operate in different industries can have similar trademarks as long as they are not easily confused. E.g., the Marvel \"Iron Man\" name and logo is a registered trademark of Marvel, but the \"Ironman\" name and logo is also a trademark of the organization that manages the Ironman Triathalons. Both can have that trademark because no on confuses one product (a comic book) with the other (a triathalon). \n\n* **Patents** cover original inventions. Obtaining a patent involves a lengthy application and review process, usually involving patent attorneys. Patents are only granted for 20 years. E.g. the Nintendo Switch is patented. If Tony Stark were real, Stark Industries would have applied for a patent on the Iron Man armor designs. In the real world, a manufacturer like Dyson has a patent on its vacuum cleaners or a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer has a patent on a new drug.\n\nEdit, before someone jumps down my throat for not being expansive in my definition of IP: there *are* several other types of intellectual property as well, things like **trade secrets** (stuff that can't be copyrighted, but a company wants to keep secret -- like the recipe for Coca-cola) or **trade dress** (which is an extension of trademark that includes the \"look and feel\" of a product -- like the curly script and red can of Coca-cola), and other things . . . but the Big Three are copyright, trademarks, and patents. If you can keep those straight, you'll be in good shape.",

As a result, a fly that is 1/100th the height of a human has 1/1000000th (one millionth) of the mass of a human, roughly speaking. That means things that depend on length, or surface area, are very important at small size, and much less important at large size. And it turns out that clinging to a wall by using adhesive forces is mostly proportional to surface area, not volume.\n\nSo the fly's weight is proportional to its volume, but its adhesion to the wall is proportional to its surface area. This means that while the fly experiences one millionth of the gravity a human does, it experiences one ten-thousandth of the adhesive forces it would if it were human-sized. In other words, the adhesive force became stronger *relative* to gravity by a factor of 10. Eventually, at a sufficiently small scale, this pretty much guarantees that adhesion will be stronger than gravity.",

Now, insects live on a different scale. Mammals live from the mouse to elephant scale, insects are somewhere between 20 cm down to part of a millimeter. Which means the normally \"visible to us bugs\" are pretty much on the mid-low part of the scale. Think cats or squirrels on the mammal scale.

During deep sleep, it flushes out toxic waste that build through the day and contribute to your negative mood.\n\nDuring REM, your brain also has the chance to review emotional experiences.

Now we could prepare more food, keep them for longer, keep ourselves warm and survive different climates better, and we could keep predators at bay more easily.\n\n100,000 years ago we developed clothing and started building rudimentary shelters, instead of having to rely on caves and natural formations. This also allowed us to travel larger distances and spread out to environments we previously couldn't.\n\n70,000 - 40,000 years ago we began establishing languages and abstract thinking, as well as symbolic art (lots of cave paintings have been found from this time period). This exploded our ability to communicate, share ideas, plan, strategize, trade, share experiences, and so on.\n\n40,000 years ago we began making more advanced and relatively complex tools, such as needles, fishing hooks, rigging, instruments, more advanced clothing, and lots of other things.\n\n10,000 years ago larger scale agriculture begins, and larger and more permanent settlements begin forming across regions. This period is also called the Neolithic Revolution.\n\nNow things really start to speed up and the next 10,000 years see more technological advances than the past 300,000 years combined. Hell, the past 200 years alone has seen more significant advances in technology than at any point in history of our species.

Controlling fire, building standalone shelters and clothes, language and communication, advanced toolmaking, agriculture, the wheel, metalworking, money, writing, aqueducts and wells, urbanization, engineering, paper, printing, the clock, establishing the sciences and literacy, the steam engine, electricity, internal combustion engine, the telephone, steam ships, all the way up to the modern day computer; with more processing power than the entirety of the computer systems needed to land on the moon in your pocket. Each of these inventions came as a result of finding out something new about how the world works. The reason why it took so long at the start was because we were just animals. We had no idea how anything worked or why they worked that way, but with each new discovery, a whole new world opened and it had a massive snowball effect. We solved problems to make things easier for ourselves, the easier we had it, the easier it was to do more things in new ways, which resulted in more problems being solved, and so on.

These tipping points accelerated innovation and opened new areas of technology.  As you can see in the last 200years, the speed is accelerating exponentially because tipping points are coming more frequently due to the ever increasing scope of our abilities and knowledge.",

I've been driving big trucks for only a couple of years now, but I've only driven manuals. \n\nI just want to first say that most cars have RPMs that go from 700 at idle to 7,000 at max RPM. My truck idles at 800 RPM and max RPM IS 2,000. The RPM range I drive in is between 1,200 and 1,800. I only have 600 RPM available, which is when the the engine makes is peak power and torque.\n\nImagine you had 2 bikes. One is a single gear beach cruiser, and the other was a 21 speed tour bike. You will need to exert a lot of effort to get that cruiser up a steep hill. That 21 speed bile can be put in 1st gear, and you might pedal quickly, but it won't tire you out.\n\nThe dump trucks I drive weigh 55k pounds fully loaded. It takes a LOT of effort to get up to speed in a vehicle that weighs that much.\n\nThe more gears you have, the less effort it takes to get moving. My truck has a 10 speed. It has LO and LO LO, which I never use on the road because the max speed is 5 mph. It then has gears 1 through 8 that I primarily use when driving. I have to shift into 7th gear at 35 mph. That 7th gear only gets me to 45ish mph, and 8th gear gets me to 70 mph.\n\nIt just makes it so you don't need to push your truck as hard to get up to speed.\n\nThe most common transmissions are 13 and 18 speeds. How they work is they have a LO gear and 8 gears. Each of those 8 gears has the possibily to be \"split.\" Think of it as half gears between main gears. On 13 speeds, only the final 4 gears split, whereas the 18 speeds split all 8 speeds.\n\n13 speed goes 1--2--3-4--5--5.5--6--6.5--7--7.5--8--8.5. \n\n18 speed is the same, but 1--4 also split.",

That's data from 2023, but it's not going to have gone up that much since then. That places a limit to how much regular people are willing to pay extra money now for reduced fuel costs later. It reaches a point where it's just not worth it, unless the car maker needs to meet [regulatory minimums for fuel economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_average_fuel_economy) - coincidentally, we *do* see 9- and 10-speeds in pickups that have issues hitting those minimums.\n\nSemi trucks, however, are far bigger and far heavier, so they use more fuel per mile travelled. They also travel a lot more distance. This adds up to some *massive* fuel costs, well over 10 or even 20 times the costs paid by regular consumers. As a result, semi owners are willing to pay a lot more for small percentage reductions in fuel consumption.\n\nAn extra 500 dollars today for 1% lower fuel use is not going to pay itself back across the lifetime of a regular vehicle for an average person. They'd be better off sticking it in a high yield savings account and paying for 1 refill per year from that account. An extra 500 dollars today for 1% lower fuel use pays itself back in one or two years for a semi, and is a great idea.",

When you do this it will all burn at once - this does happen and we call it an explosion.\n\nhere is a video of that exact thing happening [link](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=5509ed245b268fe8&rlz=1C1JSBI_enUS1108US1108&sxsrf=AE3TifOkaEacoGrw0IJMVJRkKAJHY_DXXg:1748072393928&q=explosion+of+grain+dust&udm=7&fbs=AIIjpHxU7SXXniUZfeShr2fp4giZ1Y6MJ25_tmWITc7uy4KIeuYzzFkfneXafNx6OMdA4MQRJc_t_TQjwHYrzlkIauOKj9nSuujpEIbB1x32lFLEvPT3JmO8mWQjm2X3w-eMKXZ0RUYhz1JSpwmiVqRbYKaSUH5IT0DtjseXr7pWbySQW2IansKYxVko0I4Xq9VSCktKDaAksofpR02O_Zlq1OtpJOB00g&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjwuNOQzbuNAxVoG9AFHakXEwAQtKgLegQIGBAB&biw=1920&bih=911&dpr=1#fpstate=ive&vld=cid:28e94107,vid:5OetGMX9Lus,st:0)",

When the water comes out of the nozzle, it's pressure drops from the pressure inside the hose to atmospheric pressure and at the same time it's velocity increases. The greater the pressure drops the faster the water will exit the hose.\n\nBernoulli's principle is really a statement of conservation of energy as it applies to fluids. If the pressure drops, that potential energy is converted to kinetic energy. Of course, this is only the case if the energy is *not* being converted to some other form of energy instead.

They are actually the opposite - they are vacant, and available, 'up for sale or rent', or they are being moved out of/moved into.  \n\nThe last time I did the deep dive on this issue, I found that the 'Other' category mentioned in this article was other reasonable causes.  Under construction, being remodeled was a factor.  Damaged or unlivable housing was a factor.  Housing that was in some form of legal process (like in probate) was a factor.  \n\nAnother factor is locational.  There are a large number of truly abandoned houses, *in places where people don't want to live.*  There are mostly empty neighborhoods in cities like Detroit.  But there isn't enough work opportunity, so there is no reason to move there, and so the houses remain vacant.  \n\n>yet also have a housing crises where not everyone can find a place to live?\n\nWe, as a nation, refuse to allow houses to be built where people want to live.  Some environmentalists have been anti-housing, because it results in more resource uses (fresh water, electricity).  But I think a notable issue is that our entire policy is to raise housing prices, through increased demand from 'first time buyer programs' and other forms of 'helping homeowners', which also have the trade-off of raising prices.  \n\nAnd once someone buys a home, they have an incentive to stop other homes from being built, as it lowers their own housing values.  And so NIMBYs have way too much power in areas like Los Angeles and San Francisco.  They are supposedly 'progressive' or 'poor friendly' areas, but they refuse to allow affordable housing, and instead are mostly highly wasteful land hoarders.",

Then the yaw pedals control the tail rotor thrust. \n\nTwo axes are the same for a tandem : the collective stick applies thrust to both rotors together, and the rolling in the cyclic works by tilting both rotors left/right together. \n\nHowever, pitch and yaw are different. Since there's two rotors, you can achieve pitch by differential collective - more thrust on the aft rotor and less thrust on the forward rotor will pitch forward without necessarily increasing the total thrust, and vice versa. Similarly, yaw can work through differential cyclic - if you tilt the forward rotor to the right and the aft rotor to the left, you end up with a yaw. \n\nSo the control system in a tandem doesn't necessarily need to have longitudinal cyclic, just lateral cyclic. This all happens within the flight controls, obviously - the cockpit controls look the same and behave the same, it's just that they do different things to the rotors. \n\nTLDR:\n\nPitch is longitudinal cyclic in a single, differential collective in a tandem \n\nRoll is lateral cyclic in a single, ganged lateral cyclic in a tandem \n\nYaw is tail rotor pitch in a single, differential lateral cyclic in a tandem \n\nCollective is collective in a single, ganged collective in a tandem \n\nAlso, for what it's worth, most conventional coax rotors like Kamov and Kaman have a ganged cyclic (a pitch / roll input applies to both rotors), and do yaw through a differential collective.",

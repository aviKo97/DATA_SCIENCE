That’s the picture that emerges from a review of corporate filings, public financial data, analysis of timelines, and interviews with industry insiders. One accountant, working in-house at a tech company, described it as a “niche issue with broad impact,” echoing sentiments from venture capital investors also interviewed for this article. Some spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive political matters.\n\nSince the start of 2023, more than half-a-million tech workers have been laid off, according to industry tallies. Headlines have blamed over-hiring during the pandemic and, more recently, AI. But beneath the surface was a hidden accelerant: a change to what’s known as Section 174 that helped gut in-house software and product development teams everywhere from tech giants such as Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) to much smaller, private, direct-to-consumer and other internet-first companies.",

Still unemployed btw, but doing freelance work. \n\n\nRight around 2017 is when I noticed a big change in benefits and spending around the company I worked for. Things that kept me going at work, kept me focused and productive, like having meals on site, designing and building new infrastructure, and experimenting with new products before they would be shown to the public, starter evaporating one by one. I was wondering what was going on, especially in places like California where those benefits were generally quite juicy in exchange for giving all of your life to the company. In short, it came in part due to the Trump Tax changes in 2017. Incentives that could be written off including R&D had to be re-accounted for as this article discusses. Other benefits changed to being classified as taxable income to an employee, which meant meals either needed to become badge tracked in some way, shape or form, or they had to become paid. Of course, all of this meant less take home money for an employee. \n\n\nI know, part of that is entitlement and getting spoiled. However I saw all of this coming back then just because the changes were rather immediate, and they hit in small but noticable ways.\n\n\nNow the storm is here.  ",

Sam Altman cares that his leading competitor in the field is standing on equal ground. I will be *shocked* if there is any outcome of this in which Anthropic is “allowed” to use data that OpenAI has basically secured exclusive rights to.\n\nAnd that’s *really* not the kind of move you want to see made by someone working towards AGI.\n\nedit: Just so there's no misunderstandings, I'm pro-AI, and on Anthropic's side of this. But even if you are as staunchly opposed as it gets, and think *nothing* should be scraped for training data without the explicit informed consent of every contributor to it, *you should be too.* The precedent we're looking at here is that the best trained model is the one owned by the people rich enough to buy exclusive rights to what would otherwise be publicly available training data. That would be a terrible way for it to go, even if we didn't have Elon \"pay billions for Twitter just for the meme of it\" Musk continually trying to wedge his way into the field.",

Kennedy Jr. unilaterally revoked and altered some of the CDC's recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines, restricting access to children and pregnant people. The resignation also comes three weeks before CDC's experts and advisors are scheduled to meet to publicly evaluate data and discuss the recommendations for this season—a long-established process that was disrupted by Kennedy's announcement.\n\nThe departing CDC official, Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos, a pediatric infectious disease expert, was a co-leader of a working group on COVID-19 vaccines who advised experts on the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). She informed her ACIP colleagues of her resignation in an email on Tuesday.\n\n\"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role,\" Panagiotakopoulos wrote.",

Teams is not a particularly great Video and Meeting Software so banking on people needing that is not a good plan. Teams like many other things people use for Work From Home already CAN be used in a browser on Linux or Mac. So ending support for Windows 10 is going to push more of the market including individuals and companies to shift more to Online Browser based Software instead of OS Software.\nThis may fall under the laws specifically in the EU covered the right to repair and planned obsolescence. \n\nI think Microsoft is either going to have to extend service on Windows 10 or release a version of Windows 11 that works on older machines. The main reason for the hardware requirements on Windows 11 has to do with the AI integration they are pushing so the way around that is to have a version that disabled all of the AI by default.\n\nMicrosoft believes they are too big to fail and no one could ever usurp them.  The truth is the only entity that could takedown Microsoft is their own mismanagement and they appear to be on that course.",

They very rarely crash or simply shit the bed like a computer might — these things are buttery smooth and it’s so easy to get lost in them. The algorithmic timelines only exploit this usability. \n\nI remember when kids were first given iPads and the parents would fawn over them, praising how clever they were. These dipshits aren’t clever — the devices are just so well made. Straight off the bat these things were good. \n\nAdd in an algorithm that only seems to reward _the best_ or _the biggest_ or _the most obnoxious_ content, and it’s as if we’re side-loading our brain processing power for Big Tech’s engagement rates and ad revenue. \n\nIt was at least _kind of_ manageable pre-algorithm — back when timelines were filled just with stuff the user opted in to (“followed”, “subscribed” etc…).

You might hop straight back in 40 minutes or so, but you’ll realise nothing’s updated and head back out again after a minute or so of screen time. Healthy.\n\n“Not good enough,” said Big Tech. _Now_ the fridge generates McDonald’s on demand. Now, users head for a fridge for a quick snack and are given 20 McNuggets on-demand until they feel so gross with themselves after 40 minutes of scrolling; only to repeat the same lengthy slog in 10 minutes time once they’ve had a relieving burp. \n\n_Edit: ahhh I’m glad this resonated. Thanks for the award!_",

The company already blocks access to residents of several US states over the same issue.\n\nOn June 7, porn platforms in France will legally be required to implement age verification systems. The law is part of a set of measures France passed in 2023 to protect minors from inappropriate online content.\n\nWebsites hosting pornographic content will need to verify French visitors' ages using a credit card or government-issued ID document. The operators must offer a double-blind option from a third-party that theoretically protects users' anonymity from the platforms themselves.\n\nBut, as has long been the case in the US, Aylo claims that this method places people's data at risk from bad actors, hacks or leaks.\n\nSolomon Friedman, a partner at private equity firm Ethical Capital Partners, which bought Aylo in 2023, told reporters that the French law was \"dangerous,\" \"potentially privacy infringing\" and \"ineffective.\"\n\n\"It's a matter of putting our values first, and that means communicating directly with the French people to tell them what their government is refusing to tell them,\" Friedman said, as reported by Politico.",

        "body": "What I got: \n\nClimate change is a serious issue, but the urgency and scale of the threat depend on how you define “urgent” and what aspects of the planet you’re considering. Let’s break it down with evidence, keeping it concise and informal as you like.\n\nWhy It’s Seen as Urgent:\n\n•  Rising Temperatures: Global average temperatures have risen about 1.1°C since pre-industrial times, per NASA and IPCC data. This drives extreme weather—think hurricanes, heatwaves, and wildfires. For example, 2024 saw record-breaking heat in Europe and devastating floods in 东南亚 (Dōngnányà, Southeast Asia).\n•  Ecosystem Damage: Coral reefs, like the Great Barrier Reef, are bleaching due to ocean warming (NOAA reports 50% coral loss in some areas). Deforestation in the 亚马逊 (Yàmǎxùn, Amazon) accelerates carbon release, with 17% of the forest gone since 1970.\n•  Human Impact: The WHO estimates 150,000–250,000 additional deaths annually by 2030 from climate-related issues (e.g., heat stress, malaria). Low-lying areas like 孟加拉国 (Mèngjiālāguó, Bangladesh) face flooding risks, potentially displacing millions.\n•  Tipping Points: Scientists warn of irreversible thresholds—like 格陵兰 (Gélínglán, Greenland) ice sheet collapse, which could raise sea levels 7 meters. Some models suggest we’re nearing these points if emissions aren’t slashed.\n\nCounterarguments:\n\n•  Adaptability: Humans and economies have adapted to environmental shifts before. Tech like renewable energy (solar grew 24% globally in 2024) and carbon capture could mitigate impacts. Wealthier nations can afford infrastructure to handle rising seas or heat.\n•  Exaggeration Risks: Some argue apocalyptic narratives overstate short-term threats. For instance, X posts often highlight how models overestimated near-term sea level rise (e.g., 2007 IPCC predictions vs. actual 3.7mm/year rise). Natural variability, like solar cycles, also influences climate.\n•  Economic Trade-offs: Rapid decarbonization could tank economies, especially in developing nations like 印度 (Yìndù, India), reliant on coal. Critics say this could harm more people than climate impacts in the short term.\n\nMy Take:\n\nThe evidence shows climate change is a real, growing problem—ecosystems and vulnerable populations are already hurting. It’s urgent for places like 太平洋岛国 (Tàipíngyáng Dǎoguó, Pacific Island nations) facing existential threats. But “planet-ending”? That’s a stretch; Earth’s survived worse. The urgency depends on your frame: decades for systemic fixes, but immediate for at-risk communities.",

Forcing people to shady websites while making everyone risk exposing sensitive data about themselves is absolutely going to increase Identity Theft, Blackmail and suicides from Sextortion.\n\n\nAny government that implements these kinda laws is essentially creating a treasure trove for hackers to target, whether it is by attacking databases that store these details or by spoofing a popup to make people send them info directly. The members of governments that introduce these laws should be personally liable to cover the inevitable financial costs to the public and be held responsible for the avoidable deaths that will come when people get extorted about their sexual preferences being exposed.\n\n\nThere laws are being demanded by Far Right lobby groups in multiple countries, they're nothing to do with public safety.",

And we are talking BIG cost inscreases PER - like going from $50 to $2k PER connection. Then add the thing that those connections go into - also are way more expensive - and they burn out and need replacment every so many years. \n\nFiber is costly - but way better - great solution for all cities of all sizes. Crap for outside of the city.\n\nStarlink - crap for big cities (does not work well when too many in a condensed area). But the best for homes where you drive to your neighbour as they are a big much of a walk (+5min) and just great if there at not too many base stations in one given area.",

Documents obtained by GeekWire show 22% of the affected employees were in software engineering, equivalent to 67 workers.\n\nSo according to these figures, Microsoft is around 42% software engineers, and yet a lay off which is 22% software engineers is “disproportionately affecting software engineers”.\n\nShame on tech journalists.\n\nNot to mention, 300 people is a 0.1% rounding figure to a company like Microsoft.\n\nIt’s hard to find an up to date figure for number of software engineers. So took a conservative approach that they didn’t employ any more software engineers since 2021 (but also didn’t fire any).\n\nIf you instead assume that ratio of software to non-software ratio stayed the same then we get a ratio of 55% software engineers, as in 2021, Microsoft had 180k employees: https://m.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/MSFT/microsoft/number-of-employees\n\nI would say that these lay offs are disproportionately affecting non-software engineers.

We opted out at the time because of more and more comments people made about the build quality.\n\nSo this means that they will have to work really hard actually making a quality product so they can slowly earn trust back... although even if they drop Musk from the board he will still own the vast number of shares and I don't know how he can put that much stock up for sale without tanking the stock price... which their board obviously won't approve.",

They were recently given [criminal contempt referrals](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62xv43xqq5oa) for this behavior and *lying in court about it*.  They stopped doing this last month in the US only, despite the 2021 court order being in effect since January 2024.\n\nIn the EU, Apple was fined [€1.8 billion last year](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/api/files/document/print/en/ip_24_1161/IP_24_1161_EN.pdf) for this very same behavior, followed by [an additional €500 million fine](https://appleinsider.com/articles/25/05/27/apple-has-a-month-to-comply-with-eu-antisteering-mandate-or-get-fined-again) a month ago, and now we await seeing if they will require even more motivation to stop.\n\nAside from the potential criminal investigation for lying to judges and defying a court order, and [DOJ antitrust](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24492824-apple-antitrust-suit-224-cv-04055/) starting soon for platform abuse, and \"[The App Store Freedom Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3209/text/ih)\" aspiring to legislate better-behaved platforms, they currently face a [US consumer class action](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/07/12/apple-app-store-class-action/74388101007/) and a [UK consumer class action](https://uk.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/mobile-app/apple-class-action-alleges-app-store-charges-excessive-fees/) seeking about $10 billion be returned from the excessive fees and the fraud they perpetrated to collect them, and a [US class action by developers](https://www.engadget.com/apps/apple-hit-with-class-action-suit-from-developers-after-app-store-ruling-120058208.html) to return the excessive fees they were forced to pay while Apple was under court order to allow them to use competing payment options.

        "body": "The US Department of Energy (DOE) is canceling billions of dollars in awards intended to reduce industrial carbon emissions, and it is proposing major cuts to programs focused on decarbonization. Clean technology proponents warn that the moves may slow adoption of methods that reduce pollution and could undercut the country’s status as a clean technology leader.\n\n  \nThe canceled awards include an Eastman Chemical plastics recycling plant, ExxonMobil’s switch to hydrogen fuel at a Texas refinery, an Orsted low-carbon methanol facility, a project by LanzaTech and Technip Energies for low-carbon ethylene, Sublime Systems’ low-carbon cement plant, a collaboration between Via Separations and Nippon Dynawave Packaging to cut emissions in paper production, and several plans to use carbon capture technologies. The DOE says the projects aen’t economically viable and wouldn’t provide a good return on investment.\n\nThe awards had been issued by the DOE’s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) during the Joe Biden administration. In a budget request for the DOE released May 30, the Donald J. Trump administration proposes eliminating funding for OCED and making major cuts to other offices focused on decarbonization.\n\n  \nNotably, the request proposes zeroing out the budget for the Office of Technology Commercialization, which researches ways to commercialize clean technologies. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, responsible for managing the network of national laboratories, could face a 74% cut. The Advanced Research Projects Agency–Energy, which supports commercialization of clean technologies, could see a 57% budget reduction.\n\nSeveral chemical projects funded by OCED have been spared, including Dow’s plan to make carbonate solvents and other ethylene derivatives from captured carbon on the US Gulf Coast and a BASF endeavor that seeks to produce syngas from the by-products of a Texas chemical manufacturing site.\n\n  \nLeading up to Trump’s second term, many clean technology analysts predicted that his administration’s focus on boosting US manufacturing might provide some protection for decarbonization projects funded during the Biden administration.\n\n“A fair number of analysts, including me, may have overestimated the appeal of industrial jobs and projects that are not on the ground yet,” says Derrick Flakoll, a North American policy analyst at the research firm BloombergNEF.",

Of course it is misaligned. Nobody should ever maximize shareholder value. Instead one should always maximize general value for all of humanity (or all living things if you want to be a more inclusive treehugger)\n\nIf we take the AGI dreams of the techbros seriously, superintelligent AI knows this. After all the superintelligent AI of the future is capable of ethical reasoning beyond what any human is capable of. It's right from the definition of superintelligece they give. Superintelligend AI know ethics far better than me or you. And that AI knows and understands if (and why) it is important to act in line with ethical principles.\n\nThe superintelligent AI of techbro's dreams understands all of that. And, if it understands that, it will take that, and a million other factors into consideration, and from those considerations arrive at an answer that is unfathomably more intelligent than what a human could come up with.\n\nThat sounds good. Until a CEO hears a superintelligent answer they don't like and then goes: \"That's nice and all, but you should focus on maximizing shareholder value\"\n\nI have no problem with the dream of superintelligent AI. Superintelligent AI understands ethics superintelligently. If it is important to act ethically, it will do that better than any human ever could.\n\nWhat should not happen, is that superintelligent AI is controlled by idiots. That's the recipe for disaster. As long as superintelligent AI is in control, I have no worries. As soon as some idiot can get very intelligend answers, in order to reach very stupid aims, based on obviously idiotic premises? That's where the problems start.\n\ntl;dr: The true doomsday scenario is when idiots get control over superintelligent AI.",

Commercial entities don't tend to get things for free, they are accounted for somewhere. Households get things for free.\n\n\nAlso, one of the proposed solutions is to require companies to pay for 85% of the capacity if they don't use it.

The fact that we're literally sticking arrays of electrodes into soft, delicate brain tissue just feels… creepy and borderline barbaric. The brain isn't some static circuit board—it’s a living, constantly adapting organ. Neurons don’t like being impaled. Over time, the tissue gets inflamed, the cells around the implant can die, and even the connections the implant relies on can weaken or degrade. It's like trying to solve a software problem with a hammer and nails.\n\nI really believe the future isn’t going to be these metallic, hardwired implants—it’s going to be biological. We need interfaces that work with the brain on its own terms, that adapt, regenerate, and integrate like natural tissue. Maybe genetically engineered neurons, or bio-compatible scaffolds that grow with the brain. Until then, this stuff just feels like cyberpunk horror pretending to be medical progress.",

In less than five years, the U.S. has collected DNA samples from over 130,000 minors, including children as young as four.\n\nSince 2020, the US Customs and Border Patrol has ramped up its contributions to the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) overseen by the Federal Bureau of Investigations. CODIS stores DNA profiles from convicted offenders, unsolved crime scenes, and missing persons cases for local, state, and federal law enforcement use. The actual, physical DNA samples are stored indefinitely by the federal government. Excluding forensic ones, CODIS currently has 23 million DNA profiles, and as many as 133,539 of them belong to detained children and teenagers, according to documents reviewed by Wired.\n\nAccording to Wired’s report, CBP collected samples of between 829,000 and 2.8 million people from October 2020 to the end of 2024. This came after 2020 updated regulations surrounding DNA collection from the Department of Justice that removed the Department of Homeland Security’s exemptions. The California Law Review critiqued the DOJ’s decision as one that “may be the first to result in the government’s widespread, permanent retention of genetic materials based solely on a status other than a criminal arrest or conviction.”",

As part of that article, I asked teachers to tell me how AI has changed how they teach.\n\nThe response from teachers and university professors was overwhelming. In my entire career, I’ve rarely gotten so many email responses to a single article, and I have never gotten so many thoughtful and comprehensive responses. \n\nOne thing is clear: teachers are not OK. \n\nThey describe trying to grade “hybrid essays half written by students and half written by robots,” trying to teach Spanish to kids who don’t know the meaning of the words they’re trying to teach them in English, and students who use AI in the middle of conversation. They describe spending hours grading papers that took their students seconds to generate: “I've been thinking more and more about how much time I am almost certainly spending grading and writing feedback for papers that were not even written by the student,” one teacher told me. “That sure feels like bullshit.”\n\nBelow, I have compiled some of the responses I got. Some of the teachers were comfortable with their responses being used on the record along with their names. Others asked that I keep them anonymous because their school or school district forbids them from speaking to the press. The responses have been edited by 404 Media for length and clarity, but they are still really long. These are teachers, after all.",

Are we not setting them up for failure by training them through systems that clearly will be dominated by AI? There are valid in person assessments, but they generally do not readily scale in an objective manner.\n\nThe deeper development universities/schools provide is a result of mentorship, connections with like minded peers, challenging experiences, and reflection.

        "body": "Chiming in here as a Veteran with PTSD who has gone off and on to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for several years through the VA, as well as utilizing psychiatric medicine as well.\n\nOne of the initial ‘barriers of care’ one must go through, regardless of if you’re a Veteran or not, is aligning with your therapist. Perhaps it can be said though, that Vets do project a unique challenge in that the vast majority of therapists cannot relate to the Veterans trauma. It can be defeating, patronizing, even infantilizing, when you are dealing with a therapist or doctor who does try to relate or equate your trauma to their own, or other types of trauma in general. It can also be dehumanizing when said therapists take a more disassociated clinical approach. Which is quite the Catch-22 (pun intended). Too much sympathy without empathy doesn’t work, so does no sympathy or empathy at all. But how many therapists are you going to find that have been ‘through the shit,’ as they say, and come out the other side well adjusted? Enough to obtain a Masters or Doctorates? It does happen. Post Traumatic Growth can create the most successful people. But those kind of guys aren’t working for the government. Maybe a few years, cut their chops. But then they’re going into private practice where the real money is so they can pay off whatever college debt they accrued their military benefits didn’t cover.\n\nOur bullshit meter is damned sensitive, so many of us have complicated relationships with our providers. \n\nAdd to this, more often than not the patient is blamed for said complications. After all, as a society we are quick to dismiss and judge those with mental health issues. Who are you gonna trust? The guy with an 8 year degree, dressed in business casual, clean cut with their own office space? Or the tubby, tattooed Vet with anger issues and ‘poor interpersonal communication?’ \n\nThis kind of combative care leaves both patient and practitioner frustrated and exhausted, which becomes counter-intuitive.\n\nAll that said - enter ChatGPT.\n\nAll of that is gone. You know you’re talking to a machine. You don’t need the machine to care about you in order to be vulnerable with it. You don’t care if it’s calculated responses come across as cold or unfeeling. It can, and often does, say the same things you’d hear in a real therapy session, but you’re reading it now, internalizing it, exploring it on your own, without directed guidance and without expectation. Gone are all the pretenses of human interaction. The machine will not get frustrated with you unless you tell it, it will not incidentally condescend you, unless you tell it to. \n\nIt’s like a hybrid between a human therapist and a self-help book without either of the drawbacks. With these large language models you can get help on your own and you can actively explore and engage (ask clarifying questions) instead of working with static printed material. \n\nThat’s empowering. And feeling empowered is a critical component of practicing self-care.\n\nOh and like everyone else is mentioning, it’s cheap if not practically free.",

Part of therapy is the non-verbal communication too, which is why it's not being held over text. ChatGPT isn't going to know if you're having a panic attack or traumatic episode because it dug too deep into your trauma. It doesn't know how to tailor treatment plans based on your specific needs. Most importantly it's not going to remember and use this information in future \"sessions\" to help you grow and work towards goals. It sounds like most of y'all are just looking for advice, which is not therapy or counseling. If you need to have someone listen while you rant, you could just go to a bar and at least then you wouldn't be sharing PHI with a literal robot whose data is accessible by millions of people.",

        "body": "I'm a therapist; obviously I'm a stakeholder in this discussion, but I wanted to provide a nuanced take.\n\n\nPros: If mental health services can be safely administered by an AI, that is straightforwardly a good thing. That would be an amazing technology that could expand access to health care for literally hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. Despite the existential threat that this tech would present to my industry, *it could be a good thing.*\n\n\nCons: \n\n\n1, We're Extremely Not There Yet. AI simply hallucinates too regularly, and purports to be using therapeutic techniques when it is in fact not using them to be both useful and safe. This may change, but that is the current state of affairs.\n\n\n2 Professional standards exist for a reason. Licenses, and the high cost to get them and the resulting cost of therapy, exist for a reason. Namely, to protect the public from incompetent or malicious therapists. To whom do we appeal when the AI recommends a suicide pact? Or fails to report child abuse? It's not a licensed professional, it's not a mandated reporter. There are no standards and therefore no recourse for misconduct or harmful treatment. That's a huge deal.\n\n\n3 Evidence -Based Practices: i.e., how do we know that therapy is even working and what techniques tend to create change, have guided the field for at least the last 50 years. AI is, by nature, a black box. We don't know how it works or how it connects ideas, and therefore all of its interventions may or may not be evidence based. Crucially, WE CANT KNOW what is and is not evidence based unless a human reviews the content, which brings us back to professional standards and the high costs of competency.\n\n\n4 Privacy and Ethics. This goes without saying, but AI companies harvest data from you. That's like... Their whole thing. Not only is nothing you tell a chat-bot protected by confidentiality laws, it's usually just straightforwardly the right of the company to use that content however they want. Some disclosures have significant social consequences and deserve confidentiality.\n\n\nNeutral thoughts/ conclusions;\n\n\nI'm an old fogey. I like older therapies, such as psycho analysis and existential therapy as much or more than I like CBT. My kind of therapy actually is AI proof, because it focuses on the current experiences created by the dialectic between my clients and I in-the-room, in the here-and-now, and AI can't create or observe that dialectic. So I'm less threatened than alot of my more manualized colleagues by the emergence of AI.\n\n\nI'd be lying if I said I was comfortable with people talking to LLM's, but people get shitty, harmful feedback from all kinds of sources. They also get great feedback from unexpected places. I truly believe that this could be, if we work diligently to work out the kinks AND protect people from the unethical exigencies of for-profit data miners, an excellent resource for mental health support. Not treatment, support.\n\n\nThere's a real gap in services right now. I'm expensive - as are all of the colleagues I would confidently refer clients to. Cost of access to these services is a real consideration, and access to excellent mental healthcare is increasingly relegated to a luxury for those who can afford it instead of the human right that it is. That's Very Bad, and if AI can be made to fill the gaps WE SHOULD ABSOLUTELY USE IT.\n\n\nFor now, please: if you're talking to an LLM, know you're talking to a tool, produced to collect your data and maximize it's own use time. That's dangerous. Especially when you're putting your mental health in its hands.",

Not to mention breeding a generation of people with no creative skills.\n\n\nEdit: Wow, I sure ruffled some tech bro feathers here. 😅\n\n\nFor context, I'm a senior-level developer with a lot of experience with AI, ML and LLMs under my belt. I've seen far too many juniors coming into the industry who don't know the fundamentals of coding, and who rely far too heavily on ChatGPT to do the work for them, without any attempt to understand what it spits out. I've had friends lose their jobs to be replaced with flawed AI models, and I've seen established businesses fail due to this.\n\n\nOn the side, I'm a game developer. I've seen an increasing reliance on AI for the creative side, with many artist and musician friends struggling to get work. My wife is a writer, and has had her entire body of work stolen to train Meta's AI.\n\n\nSo yes, I'm anti-AI. But with good reason.",

That said, for researching basic questions, or for drafting basic documents which I can then go over and alter as needed, it’s fantastic and often saves me hours of work.\n\nYou have to double check everything. You never trust a citation until you’ve re-looked it up yourself. But I’ve found that doing that is usually a lot faster than starting from scratch by myself, though I have definitely had times where the answer it gives is a little too good and turns out to be mostly bullshit.\n\nThe truth is that everyone will use it somewhat differently. Lawyers who ask it to write their arguments for them and not even double check the citations are asking for trouble, but lots of people are overworked and stressed and people take dumb shortcuts in those situations. I don’t think those people are themselves dumb or lazy, they just do something stupid because they’re stressed and probably not familiar with the perils of AI.\n\nGoing forward, I’d like to see more workshops for lawyers about AI. Like in regular education, we can’t and shouldn’t pretend it doesn’t exist. Instead we should educate people on its strengths and weaknesses and encourage them to become familiar with both and use it accordingly.",

YOU are the product. YOU are being spied on and all your info is being sold to anybody that wants it. The ONLY reason people like myself entertained Windows up until now has been gaming support. Linux has been the fallback for that and has grown exponentially because people need an alternative to Windows' nightmares. So, yeah, Linux market share is exploding right now, and have more gaming compatibility than ever before. I will go to Linux instead of Win11.

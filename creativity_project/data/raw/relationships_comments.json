        "body": "Well, I will say I have a personal bias against cheaters, so take my feedback on the situation going forward with that in mind. If I'm understand the situation correctly, you meant that she slept with the individual at your home or the home of the individual? \n\n\n\nPersonally, I think it does impact the situation greatly, since you do have a child with her as you say, so this individual could've been a psycho and would've put your child at risk. I would file for sole custody of your child and remove yourself from the situation, all assuming your work allows you to do such a thing. Even if not, I would base any decisions going forward around what would be best for your child first and what's best for you second, her feelings are irrelevant imo since I'll never see a 'justifiable' reason to cheat on someone (the option to leave is always there, cowards cheat instead of take it).  \n\n\n\nAlso remember to stay the course. I understand you have a kid with her and that being together for so long can make it difficult, but she obviously didn't care about ANY of that to not just cheat on you with the same person multiple times but with someone else as well. And lets not forget, these are all times she's TOLD you about, which she is a liar since she tried to deny it in the first place, so no telling how many she's really slept with during the entire 8 years. Stay strong friend and keep putting one foot in front of the other.",

It sounds like you’re generally supportive of her passion, so I’d try to stick with bringing up those specific examples rather than saying you’re annoyed about her talking about her writing. \n\nMore practically, it sounds to me like she could use a writing group and community to discuss with. Does she have that? You could point out some local options or maybe find a course (some even specialize in the editing stage) and treat her to it?

        "body": "I come to this as someone who does a lot of creative writing and as someone who has a tendency to get really passionate about a new thing for a while (ADHD dx is being discussed).\n\nOne thing I think a lot of people here ignore when they just give you advice on how to handle your wife's current passion is that creative hobbies, ESPECIALLY WRITING OR ART, are incredibly personal. That she is sharing that with you makes her vulnerable and requires, in my opinion, a bit more nuance than some of the advice here gives.\n\nI had a phase like that. I wrote every day for two months and finished a 100k fantasy book. My partner at the time made a few comments like you are thinking about making and I could never forget them. They cut extremely deep because it was a bit of my soul on that page. It impacted me on a subconscious level a lot and I began to pull back from him. \n\nSo, I honestly want to give you a few ideas that are a little less \"just tell her\":\n\n1) wait. It's been only four weeks. At her rate, she'll finish whatever she is working on soon. You're in it for the long run, why not let her explore this for a while? If you'd get a new hobby like marathon, you'd have to dedicate more \"you time\" and take from your \"us time\" as well. It'll pass. There will be a routine. And if not, then you can discuss. But in the hobby honeymoon phase? So quickly? Why?\n\n2) redirect. There are writing discords, with people \"sprinting\" together, giving each other feedback, brainstorming etc. If you want to, DM me and I'll give you some pointers. Be supportive in your redirecting and say \"I love that this is something you are so passionate about but I am not very helpful, I know that. But there are some groups I've found for you with people you can discuss the nitty-gritty of drafting and revising with!\"\n(Personal opinion and I am afraid of summoning them but: keep her away from Facebook and Reddit writing groups...)\n\n3) stupid little thing: bring her a snack when she is writing. I tend to forget time and having a supportive partner now, who just shows up, makes it easier for me to think in time increments, finish one chapter at a time and ensure I make time to be there for them as well.\n(Yes, sometimes some new writer needs a bit of gentle parenting 😅 it's an emotional roller coaster ok?)\n\n4) when she is telling you about her thing, as stupid as it sounds, ask a few questions. Focus on motivation instead of lore. You might learn something new about her and how she sees people, and it is less boring for you.\n\n5) date wise, it's gonna get better. See 1). Also, when it comes to this, you have a safer ground to communicate. \"Hey, how about you do some morning sprints with your writing group, then we have a fun day out. I know there is so much of your story going on in your head, but I really wanted to do this thing and it would mean a lot for you to be all in. Promise, the page is still there later.\" That does not shame her for writing, hurt feelings are less likely, and you might get what you want.\n\n6) re grandparents, same thing as 5. Make room for her writing rant, let it pass, then communicate what you need unrelated to her writing. Less risk of defensiveness, and she has gotten it out of her system first. \"would love to hear about what you are working on and how your day went! (Insert her gushing about whatever wonderful thing her brain came up with, actually engage with it, then:) yeah, my day was great/... too but I had something on my mind bugging me. I am really nervous to meet your family. Can you walk me through what we'll do and what I should know?\"\n\n\n\nBefore anyone comes for me: does *she need to do any of that? Ofc not. \n\nDoes every newbie writer need that? Ofc not.\n\nDoes she remind me A LOT of myself when I rediscovered writing and would these things have saved me a lot of hurt from my previous partner and actually helped me figure out how to manage writing in a less obsessive way? Yup. My advice is subjective, shocker, I know.\n\n\nEdit: I misgendered OP. Apologies!",

        "body": ">our weekends were always us going on a date and spending time together since it's the only time we really get one on one time.\n\nI would approach this more in depth. The way you no longer have dates together. Start small, carving out time together for a small date within the next two weeks. I don't mean you planning this, I mean *both* of you planning it and being present for each other. Be honest with her that writing isn't your hobby, it's hers. While you love her for having this hobby, it's not your passion to think about it 24/7. This isn't about making her stop talking about writing (that's negative), it's about helping her calm her mind to think about other things (that's positive). In a way, you need to help her decompress from writing because it's become an obsession. Some people dive into hobbies this way. You dont want to come off as a parent scolding a kid for staying out late, but rather as her best friend who misses her and just wants to see her.\n\nI believe that life needs to be a balance of our different priorities. Her writing is awesome, but nothing can take the full spotlight. Otherwise, we lose the rest of the things and people that matter to us. She doesn't even care that her grandparents are coming over. I compare it to working too much. Many people get into the habit of working 7 days a week, and then their relationship falls apart, but they don't realize it for a few years and then it's too late. I was married, going to college, and working full time, all at once. It was a very delicate balance, and she was very patient with me, but we needed to have time set aside each week that was just *us*, not me studying for a test, not me planning out my next work shift, just us. Some weeks it was just her meeting me for a long lunch between classes. School is a bit different because it has an end in sight, but she might feel that way too. She might think, \"I'll slow down once I finish this one volume,\" but suddenly a year went by and she's very distant from you.",

I am divorced now, but I remember feeling like I was the only one who ever planned vacations and dates (or anything for that matter). I really wanted him to take the time to plan out a vacation or even just a date night. I brought this up to him over and over again and it just resulted in nothing. When I would force him to it just felt like I was still planning everything and just telling him what to do. We ended up going to couples counseling and my therapist asked my ex if he ever planned anything in his life. He replied, “No.” Apparently before he met me whenever he would go on vacation he would 100% wing it. He lives his life just winging it… wakes up and just raw dogs it with no plan at all. The counselor then asked me the same question but I said yes! I plan out everything from when I wake up to when I go to bed. I plan shit out for weeks, months, years. She then asked my ex if he liked that about me. He said he loved it. He didn’t necessarily need a plan in his life, but he liked spending time with me and enjoyed our time together whether I made a plan or not. He enjoyed the dates and vacations that I planned out. She then brought up the idea that planning was something I brought into the relationship. My ex didn’t take the time to plan anything because that just wasn’t who he was as a person, but he loved going along with my plans and I have anxiety if I don’t have a plan. Planning things was something I brought into the relationship and excelled at. My ex brought other things into the relationship that he excelled at, for example he has always been great at giving very thoughtful gifts. I’m not necessarily the best at that. We divorced for other reasons, but his lack of planning ended up not being one of them. Especially since your gf is on medication now, but does still seem to enjoy being intimate with you, maybe initiating is something you do in the relationship? If it really is a deal breaker for you then by all means move on. There are women out there who will initiate more by their own nature. But if she brings other things into your relationship and shows you love in ways that she is comfortable with and you enjoy, perhaps it’s not a hill to die on. 🤷‍♀️",

I didn't feel wanted, I felt more like he was just having sex with me because that's what you do in a relationship. I sat down and told him these things straight forward, with no accusations (aka I didn't blame him for having a lower sex drive or for hurting our relationship). \n\nNow, he initiates regularly. Maybe still not as much as me, and that's okay because I do have the higher sex drive and him initiating even 1/4 of the time makes me feel wanted. \n\nIt really comes down to two things. First is finding a compromise. The last thing you want is for her to feel like an object for you to feel satisfied, or for you to be unsatisfied to avoid her feeling objectified. You've gotta find a happy middle which might not 100% meet your needs and might be a little much for her, but makes both of you content. Though both of you have to be okay with this or it may cause more issues down the road. Second is if she really wants to change this about herself for you. She may not enjoy it to a level that you can be happy with, or you may need it \"too much\" for her. Some people are just not sexually compatible, and that's an option too. As much as it sucks, a true sexual incompatibility isn't really possible to come back from. \n\nEither way, expressing your needs is not selfish or shallow. It's protective of yourself. You've been with her for over a year. Just talk to her. Good luck!",

I say try because we both have chronic pain issues, so it's never guaranteed that things will happen, but it lets him know that I am interested and if we don't do it that night it does typically happen the next day. So maybe this is a compromise you can bring up with your gf. \nAnother thing to consider is that frequent sex in the beginning was just new relationship energy and it has settled down now that you are more comfortable with each other. \nWomen also tend to not want sex if they are carrying most of the emotional load or household chores etc. Not saying this is the case for you but if it is, it's something you need to consider working on.

It felt like he suddenly wasn't interested anymore and I was heart broken. It's a longer story than even this comment so I wont go into it but it had nothing to do with his feelings for me. \n\nDespite my reservations about sex, I am still conditioned to connect it with love, intimacy, and being wanted and cared for. So while I don't relate to the feeling of needing or missing sex, I do relate to not feeling wanted BECAUSE of a lack of sex.

You just dont want to force someone to have sex. \n\nIf she cant work on it, im afraid you just arent compatible. I hate saying that because as an ace I KNOW different libidos CAN work. But i dont mind having sex when he wants it, as long as he makes the move. If she isn't in that head space, there isnt much she can do. \n\nThere are such a thing as sex counselors who can help with this stuff though, if you have the time and money to see one.",

What we've landed on now after some trial and error is:  1) he keeps one side of his headset open so if I wanted to say anything/ask questions he would immediately hear me. 2) he often makes a a snack before hand for us to share 3) he lets me know timing expectations ahead of time so I can have input 4) he generally asks what I'll be doing so we can feel together in the space while doing our own things 5) every once in awhile he turns his mic off to comment on something to me or to tell me things about the game/conversation. \n\n\nNow what works for my relationship obviously won't necessarily automatically work for yours.

Like.. \"A partner who cares about me wouldn't do this level of shitty.\" \n\nI care about my parnter's happiness and well-being ... She is going to move across the country dropping everything she knows to be with me... Let me spend a few weeks REALLY considering our lives together and to make sure we are both on the same page about our futures together before she turns her life over for me. THAT is the thought process of a considerate partner.",

You are about to have a child. At what point in your life are you going to disengage from your mother and stop letting fear of retribution from her rule your life? You are bending over backward to avoid confrontation that is inevitable only because she is making it so. \n\nIt's normal to want your 30yo married daughter to have her own bank account and privacy and full independence. Your mom is not being a good parent, and you need to get WAY better at drawing boundaries very quickly. This has the potential to derail your marriage if you do not get a better handle on this. \n\nThey should not have felt comfortable to show up unannounced, they should have been told they couldn't stay over and definitely not for multiple nights. That is a microscosm of your relationship. You let them tread all over your life and your marriage. And then instead of telling your mother to knock it the fuck off and leave your home, you tell her and your husband they need to get along. Your husband would have every right to be upset and i think it speaks well to his character that he's been fairly even-keeled.\n\nI think you would really benefit from talking to a therapist about how to set boundaries with your mother, and I would not wait to get that started. With the baby coming she is going to use it as an excuse to take over your life at a time when things are in a huge moment in yours and your husband's life and you will already be going through tremendous stress. She needs to know that she is not welcome in your home unless invited, that she is to treat you and your husband with respect at all times, and that she will be asked to leave if that does not happen. You will have to be willing to kick her out and stop talking to her on an at least temporary basis in order to enforce these boundaries.\n\nYou need to stop seeing your parents as your primary family unit, and you need to start seeing you and your husband and your child as your primary family unit.

There is nothing to feel guilty about - yes, they are helping you, but the price you pay for this is their abusive behavior towards you, to the detriment of your mental health.\n\nPutting up solid boundaries is pretty hard when they are controlling one of the most basic necessities in your life. The fact that your mother exploded at exactly the moment you tried to state your boundaries was to be expected: this is what boundary-challenged people do when they meet one. They up the ante. Because it works.\n\nOn the other hand, you have options.\n\nYour parents need your participation in this thing they have going where they want to make you feel miserable and small about yourself and your life choices. That's not saying it's your fault! It's just that ostensibly not considering their words important can take away some of the power they have over you.\n\nSo one option is to stop engaging. \"I'm sorry you see it that way\" is a great answer to whatever accusations they throw at you. \"I'm happy where I'm at\" is another. \"Okay\" is even better, especially when followed up with you leaving to a place that is much nicer than being with parents who are horrible to you. You don't discuss your choices with them. You don't discuss your life with them. They lost the right to that information when they started using it against you. And you certainly don't need their permission.\n\nAlso, you say they have medical needs? I assume they depend on you, too. That is a bit of leverage. They can lean into your feeling of guilt, but I would suggest that that your guilt is both unnecessary and not serving you. Your responsibility ends where their bad behavior towards you begins. Your help is conditional on their behavior. This is not something I would necessary express, but it is something you can keep as a rule for yourself. \n\nThe last one is obvious. Is there a viable path for you to get a place of your own? If so, that is your new goal. You are going to have to start planning for this.\n\nIn the meantime, all the best.",

I can empathise with you on that.\nForgive any poor wording, but I would suggest that you create a separate mental space for yourself while at home to help protect yourself from the stress. Within this mental space, find the best ways to ignore the things your parents say, every word of it. Respond if they ask for something to do with their care needs, and give the bare minimum, but ignore anything further than that. Reiterate to them that you are busy, and that you can respond to them better when you're done. When you create this mental space for yourself, it can be easier to cope with everything after your material situation has improved. You can either create a better relationship with them, or cease contact with them, after you've done your part. It can be hard to communicate how hard you're trying when you're around people that have issues that they've never dealt with. It's best to save that communication for later, and to protect your mind from deteriorating from the stress. It sounds like your mother is trying very hard to hurt you and take your attention away from what matters to you. Keep working (if you can), take rests because you need them, and protect yourself from abuse until your situation is safe and healthy for you.",

Perhaps most important would be to focus on bettering yourself and building a strong mental foundation this way you wont ever have to feel like you 100% need to rely on a partner for happiness. It’s tough work for sure but it will be worth it as you get older, the good thing is that you’re young enough to take a few bumps and still have no problem getting back up. It just gets dangerous when a single person becomes the center of your world and basically controls the little red button that dictates your happiness and overall emotional stability. Being that age, a lot of us have been there and it’s not super out of the ordinary to experience things like this early on. Just do yourself a favor and learn from it and try your best to build that foundation and meet ppl that you can cultivate true friendships with.

It's not policing his friendship or controlling what gossip he keeps up with, just making it clear what you are wanting.\n\ntbh I think you're totally reasonable - in general its pretty bad taste to reference exes all the time even if on the negative side or whatever its still makes it seem like a person's life is centered on their ex. And 2 years down the track sorry its actually pretty generally unhealthy for him to still be so focused on it",

You’re not the one who needs to assert a boundary here, he needs to put up a boundary with Christina. It sounds like she is using your boyfriend as a place to vent and frankly that’s not ideal. She doesn’t have girlfriends? She doesn’t have siblings or family to rant about this to? She’s texting/calling a man who lives states away and used to be in a committed relationship with her ex husband’s affair partner? Christina needs a boundary in place and your boyfriend needs to put it there. I would point out the distinction to Paul from a place of caring and support and ask him to self reflect and consider asking Christina to refrain from updating him anymore. My suspicion is that IF Paul asserts that boundary, Christina’s contact will fall off and the problem you’re experiencing will solve itself.",

No one can rush their healing.\n\nI remember a while back, I was talking with my current partner, and shared an anecdote about something annoying my ex-fiancé used to do.

I asked her if she thought I talked about my ex-fiancé too much, and my girlfriend advised me that she thought I talked about her a lot. \n\nThis was good food for thought, as my girlfriend and I are both very focused on healing ourselves and others. I believe this is a good opportunity for your boyfriend to do some healing. I’m not quite sure how to heal here, but I know this is a Healing Opportunity for him. \n\nI think beyond setting the boundary that you’d like to talk about the exwife less that you can also ask important Questions that can galvanize his healing. What are is intentions with staying update on his ex-wife? How does this enrich his life and your relationship? It really doesn’t enrich the relationship, but this question forces him to reflect on the consequences of his decision to talk about his ex-wife and focus on her.\n\nI’m sure someone else can come up with some better questions to ask your partner.

I was completely indifferent to him by then. \n\n\nYou are completely indifferent to your ex.Because you ve moved on and found someone else. He isn't indifferent to his ex. That's a warning sign. Even hatred is a very strong emotion.And if he still feeling strong emotions for her, there's a problem. He shouldn't be feeling anything for his ex. In the same way that you don't feel anything for yours. \n\n\nThe fact that he still so wound up and angry about his ex suggests he still has pretty big feelings for her. If he didn't have feelings for her nothing she could do would hurt him. He just wouldn't be interested at all and just shrug. \n\n\nThe bottom line is he hasn't moved on. He doesn't want to move on by the sound of it.And he still gets kicks and thrills out of hearing how badly his ex is doing. That has implications for your relationship. That suggests he bears grudges, and he is happy to continue to twist the knife in long after the original hurt has happened. I'm not saying it was right for her to cheat, but there comes a time where you just shrug, and let it go.Especially after two years. He sounds like quite a vindictive person that he's still taking joy in her suffering now.

I would have a major discussion with him.The next time he does it: that you've been meaning to talk to him about this and it's making you very uncomfortable. Say you feel that there are three people in this relationship. \n\n\nSay that his ex shouldn't be a feature in his life at all, and you re getting tired of constantly hearing about her.

You mention you took six months off, which is a substantial amount of income to replace. But from the sounds of it, you still had plenty left to allow you and your wife to be able to work a lot less in the future, which sounds like a great deal of money. But yet, that remaining money *plus* the money from your fully paid off house hasn't been enough to support your current mortgage and expenses? I'm kind of confused how that could be the case unless you did an extremely drastic upgrade. I wonder how you'd even get approved for a mortgage you can't afford even after a huge down payment.\n\nI'm also wondering if there are some frustrations on her end about this six months off. If I were her, I could certainly see myself feeling resentful if my partner used that money to just fund a six month vacation for himself when I was still working and there were other things that it could be used for that would benefit the whole family. I think it also makes a difference how much more of the household tasks you took care of during that time. And consider that your perception of that division of labor might not match hers. \n\nI'm also unclear if your wife works full time or not. If she works part time and you're wanting her to work more hours, that's pretty different than wanting her to work overtime or a second job. Especially given you got to take a six month break.\n\nI'm not sure this is the case depending on the details, but I could see it seeming from her side like you came into this sum of money, quit your old job and blew a bunch of it on a long break from work, then also agreed to the house upgrade that is for the whole family, but now you're complaining about your new job and wanting her to work extra, when the money could have been available if it weren't for your time off.",

Sometimes it’s easy just to go along with something and then you find yourself in situation you don’t enjoy and when it’s compounded by needing the work to pay for the house but you hate the work and could have easily had an easier life…..\n\nI do think it’s something you tackle together, with no blame. The reason you’re where you are doesn’t really matter anymore, it’s what you both want to do to go forward in way that is healthy for you both.\n\nYou need to sit down and tell her about the job and you don’t want to keep doing that just to meet the obligation of the house. She either has to step up NOW and take that burden off so you can recalibrate, look for a different job and not lose the house, or you consider downsizing as a couple and whatnot.\n\nUltimately, if you don’t have a shared vision for the now and the future, neither of you are gonna get where you want to be. If it’s working a lot less (I absolutely hear that; and it’s why I’m moving out of my house into one that needs a refurb, to save the money towards early retirement / mortgage free living. Work can suck at times) then she needs to be more understanding of your needs to, and the future should adequately compensate and reward you both as best as possible.\n\nSo - you need to have a difficult conversation, and perhaps go for therapy anyway. What do you actually want? What is the vision you have? Do you want to reduce working to part time? Do you want a bit more fun and more holidays instead? You’ve tried to sell her on stuff, but obviously something about that was less preferable to a bigger house. Has she ever sat down and talked about what she dreams of?\n\nThat’s the starting point. What’s the short, medium and long term vision. And how do you both get there?",

Your behaviors are trying to protect you maybe - not from your partner, more from previous ideas of love that no longer serve you.\n\n  \nIf you can, try not to fight your those competing feelings, and try to listen and understand them. For me that helped me find versions of myself still stuck in pain from previous relationships, or even familial bonds, where I experienced some hostility or mistreatment. Being cheated on, losing a best friend, being abused in my family - a lot of these painful things became associated with the idea of love for me, so falling in love brought up those feelings. It can be hard to know what you are really feeling, but if you can slow down, take it slow, and be patient with yourself, you might discover more.\n\n  \nI find that doing that first helps me a lot before looking at my partner and having a hazy sense of something not being quite right.

I'm seriously so insanely lucky, we have great sex, we have a wonderful life. \n\nAnd... there were times when I felt pretty much like you do right now.\n\nBut actually, we were both depressed and each working through sexual trauma. For me, the trauma manifested as hypersexuality, and for him it manifested as sexual repression, so I was really overwhelming him and freaking him out with my compulsive sexuality. Emotionally, I was looking for high highs and low lows because that's what I was used to, and he was shutting down and taking up as little space as possible because that's what he was used to. I felt bored, he felt inadequate, we both felt unlovable and full of shame.\n\nWe've each cheered each other on as we've worked through our own hangups, and the relationship keeps getting better as we get healthier as individuals. It's 10/10 now. We've worked through everything together so we have such a baseline of respect and trust.\n\nIn previous relationships, the guys always said and did the \"right\" things to get me hung up on them, but there was always a nagging gut feeling that it was bullshit. With my husband, it was the opposite; he wasn't pushing the easy dopamine buttons, but my gut told me everything was good and authentic and right for me. I made a decision to go with my gut and let the rest of my system catch up with it. It was the right call. I've learned to relax, be present, and appreciate the enduring warmth of a real relationship versus chasing the dragon of superficial infatuation. He's learned to take up more space and tap into his passions - also very critical for the health of the relationship. None of it happened overnight.\n\nI did have to lay down the law with getting help for ED, though. I don't want to share too much here but you can DM me. And he had to lay down the law with me to get on antidepressants and deal with some shit that was going on in my life, like overspending, being avoidant, etc. It was a process.",

He would unintentionally hurt me because I wasn't aroused, but would cry when I tried to correct or redirect him, like big bawling sobs about how he was bad in bed and couldn't please me, while I'm tearing up from pain, but making it all about him. He also wouldn't actively initiate sex or act like I was hot at all (he had some very very misguided sense that being a feminist meant that he was never allowed to objectify me ever?). I was miserable because I cared about him so much but I was SO frustrated.\n\nIt did not end well.\n\nThink about it this way:\n\nHe is fine with marrying you even though you're unhappy and unsatisfied.

All our friends are waiting for us to announce and engagement since we've been together so long and had all the same friends and they were shocked when we broke up. We didn't fight and didn't have a tense relationship so they never saw it coming, in fact he never saw it coming either.\n\nI talked to him multiple times during the relationship about initiating and being more vocal during sex with sexy talk and it never happened. I decided to stop initiating to see how long it would take till he stepped up. We went a month without having sex (We didn't live together but we lived three blocks from each other) and when I pointed that out he said he didn't even know it had been that long. \n\nBottom line; I told him we can both be great people who are great in relationships and still not be compatible to be with each other.

I did like him though, even though he was in no way life-partner material.)\n\nStaying with your boyfriend now, or in 2 weeks time, or in 6 months time, doesn't mean \"this is my life for the rest of my life.\" You're allowed to date until you're 21, or even 25, or even longer, and then say \"actually, this is no longer the relationship for me.\"  And if you guys are just enjoying dating, I would say to just keep doing what you're doing, IF it still brings you joy.\n\nHowever...if he is talking about, or if you both are seriously discussing:\n\n* moving in together\n* getting involved in each other's finances\n* getting engaged or married within the next 3 years\n* changing plans for the sake of the relationship (ie, \"I was going to go to college out of state, but I've changed my mind because I don't want to be so far away from you.\"\n\nthen perhaps you should have the difficult conversation of \"I love you, but I don't think this is the relationship I want to be in long-term.\"\n\nAnd of course, if you love your boyfriend/the relationship but keep finding yourself glancing over your shoulder, thinking longingly of the other people you could be dating or the other experiences you could be having, feeling like you've veered off from the life you imagined yourself living, it's okay to say, \"I love you and care for you, but I don't think I want to be in this relationship anymore.\"",

She found most college guys with money to be superficial and wanted someone who had work ethic. Her BF is in trades and working. That’s the dating strategy she used so to speak. Plus he is nice. But her parents aren’t thrilled with it because their generation was taught to look down on trade skills. Luckily for her she has other people like me that understand that it’s about stability and security and not if the job title sounds fancy or if they went to a top tier school. \n\nThe thing is you guys are really young. Eventually they will give in and meet you if it lasts. There may always be tension but it doesn’t mean that others in the family won’t support you. Just take it in stride if you really like her. If you guys are together for a couple years and they still haven’t met you then that’s an issue to address then.\n\nFull disclosure I didn’t meet my husband’s parents until we were engaged because they never liked any of his girlfriends lol. They meddled in his relationships and he eventually had enough of that. It was weird but hey it worked.",

        "body": "This is a tricky situation, not because you’re overreacting, but because your instincts are right, and the way you bring it up matters as much as what you’re bringing up. The key here is protecting your relationship’s respectful and open tone, while also not suppressing legitimate concerns that will eat at you if left unresolved. This isn’t about controlling your girlfriend or keeping tabs, it’s about honesty. It’s okay for her to stay out late, but lying about it, especially without any need to, is the real problem. There are a few possibilities of what might be going on (without jumping to conclusions): First, She really did go somewhere else and didn’t want to tell you this may or may not be sinister (just wanted private time, or didn’t want you to worry). Second, She knew the time was late and felt guilty, so lied to soften it. Third, something happened that she’s afraid to explain.\nBut remember all of these hinge on the same thing: she didn’t tell the truth, and she didn’t seem comfortable around you afterward. So how do you bring this up without blowing it up? You could say, “Hey, can I talk to you about something that’s been on my mind? I’m not trying to argue or accuse you of anything, this is just something I’ve been sitting with and I think I’ll feel better if I say it out loud.” (Then pause. Let her say “yeah of course” or whichever comes first) “When you went out with [friend’s name], I woke up randomly around 2:30 because of my injury, and I was still awake when you both came in around 3:15. The next day when you said you got home just before 1, I felt really thrown off, because I already knew that wasn’t the case. I didn’t know how to respond in the moment because I really didn’t want to make it into a fight. But now it’s just kind of sitting with me, and I think it’s fair to ask why you said that.”\nLet her talk. Don’t fill the silence. Don’t answer for her. If she gets defensive or tries to shut it down, remain calm and state “I’m not upset about the time itself, I’m upset that you felt the need to lie about it. That’s what’s bothering me. I just want to understand what that was about.”\nRemind yourself that you’re owning your feelings, not accusing her of cheating or wrongdoing (yet), you’re just pointing to a factual inconsistency, giving her a chance to explain, and protecting the tone of your relationship kind, curious, but not naive. If this becomes a pattern, or if her answer leaves more red flags, then it’s okay to reevaluate trust in the relationship. You’re not being “too sensitive” you’re being honest with yourself, which is what a good partner should do.",

That some of her answers didn’t make sense and you’d like a better understanding. Tell her your side, you went to bed, woke up, know she came in much later than she said. Her behaviour was unusual. You’d like to know what happened. Try and remain calm. Let her talk. If you find holes in her explanation, say you’re finding it difficult to understand and make sense of, and explain why. Watch her reactions, body language and replies. If you need time to think, let her know and take some space. Be honest about your feelings & confusion don’t be afraid to take time to work through this. Don’t worry about silence while you think. Don’t let her manipulate or guilt you when asking questions.

Sometimes, when emotions are high, it’s hard to communicate without saying something you might regret later. Taking space to cool down was probably the right choice at the time.\n\nIt is important to have a calm and honest conversation with her.

Now I either communicate a direct or soft boundary.\n\nA direct boundary eg I appreciate you thinking about me and as discussed, I do not have the capacity to be responsive right now. I am willing however, to check in 1x/day. And I anticipate I should be in a better zone in xyz days/weeks.\n\nIndirect boundary eg I mute this person on my phone and only respond when I feel comfortable doing so.\n\nPlease look up the pursuer-distancer dynamic. You two are ripe for perpetuating that cycle of interaction.\n\n>She actually came to my house yesterday with food and started crying, saying this is how her last relationship went. She was being ignored etc, even though she agreed to give me space to sort myself out.\n\nSo you know this person has a long history with pursuer-distancer dynamics. It's highly unlikely your experience with her will be any different. If she were capable of showing up differently in a relationship, she would have committed to doing so after the last relationship ended. \n\nIt's no coincidence that she chose someone who has a much greater need for space than she does, as she's already confirmed that is her pattern. As someone with abandonment trauma, it sounds like she's coping with serious abandonment trauma.\n\nI predict this dynamic with her will only intensify over time as she gets more invested and you'll likely revisit the decision to build a connection with someone who has the capacity to make things uncomfortable because they're right next door.",

What’s clear is that this situation isn’t sustainable for your mental well-being, your relationship with your brother, or his personal growth. I suggest saying: “I want to talk to you about something important. I’ve been thinking about this for a while because I care about you and your well-being, but I also have to be honest about how things are affecting me. When you moved in, the idea was that it would be temporary while you figured out your next steps. I know you’ve been through a lot, and I don’t want to minimize your health issues or your service. But it’s been five years, and I’m worried that staying in this limbo is actually hurting you more than helping. I’ve tried to help, we worked on a resume, I mentioned some jobs, and I know you’ve got some disability support. But the reality is, living like this indefinitely isn’t healthy for either of us. I’m working full-time, I don’t get much space to myself, and I feel like I’m enabling you to stay stuck and I don’t want that for you. So here’s where I’m at.. I think it’s time to make a change. We need to set a clear timeline for when you either start working toward a job, school, or some kind of meaningful structure in your life or start making plans to move out. I’m not kicking you out tomorrow, but I need to see effort and progress, and I’m happy to support you in that if you’re willing to engage. This isn’t about money or being harsh, it’s about both of us having lives that move forward. You deserve more than being stuck in neutral. But I can’t carry that for you.”\n\nThis could work because it’s direct but compassionate, it keeps the focus on concern, not blame, it gives him agency, but also consequences, it clearly sets a timeline or expectation shift; which is what’s missing now. Pick a firm but reasonable deadline; maybe 3-6 months for either employment, school, or independent living. Let him know ahead of time and stop doing the work for him, you already helped with resumes and lead so if he doesn’t act, that’s his choice. You should also prepare emotionally for pushback he may get defensive, guilt-trip, or withdraw. Stay calm. Repeat your message: “I care, but I can’t enable this anymore.” Most importantly, get support. You’re carrying a lot. Even talking to a therapist or counselor for you could help reinforce your boundaries and give you strength. This isn’t about making him feel bad, it’s about recognizing that being stuck isn’t safe or sustainable. You’re not just protecting yourself, you’re nudging him toward responsibility, which is ultimately what he needs most.",

And it’s definitely a him thing. My ex was very much like this… he literally told me “as a joke” that I should be wearing a burqa (we’re not even Muslim). He also lied, gaslit, and manipulated me too. My parents are old and come from a time where women wearing tight clothes or exposing their arms or legs was extremely shameful, and they’ve never said shit to me when I’ve worn tank tops, shorts, or other tight clothes, all my life. \n\nWhen you give in to his demands, you reinforce his control over you. The way he withholds affection and then tells you why later, and moves the goalpost, is bordering abusive behaviour. He deleted Reddit because he was more than likely doing shady shit like interacting with people who post thirst traps. I’m willing to bet all my money that he’s cheating on you. \n\nYou said you have kids and they notice this behaviour.

He must be controlling in many other ways, and has totally gaslight, lied, and manipulated you sooo many other times. Don’t let him suppress your expression of yourself, you’ll only grow resentful and someday you’ll be pissed you let that happen to you. I hope you drop this ass, for you and your kids.

I would beg her as a child to leave him. Let's go live somewhere to be happy. Of course, she would defend him and tell me not to make him angry and listen to him. Even after she had breast cancer,  he still treated her the same. I also believe my mom knew that my dad sexually abused me, not when it happened,  but later when I was a teenager.  My mom died of brain cancer at 45 years when I was 18 years old.\n\nFast forward 14 years later when my so-called father passed away. My brother and I were going through all his papers, and we found out that our parents had us before they got married. I called my aunt(mom's sister) and told her about the marriage certificate.  She replied that they tried to tell my dad to tell me so it wouldn't be a shock to my brother and I.  I told her it's not a big deal to me. My aunt praised her and had her so high pedestool, and then I said something about my mom not being perfect. My aunt yells me for saying that, and I turned around and said, \"If she really loved us, why didn't she leave him?\"  My aunt says to me that the family (mom's) told her to pack up everything, and everyone would come to help her move back home, give my brother and I a better life. She said no. Her reason......my dad would find her and kill her and possibly my brother and I.  My mom was right. I understood it so well when I heard how scared she was. I'm thankful that my father didn't go to that extreme. What he did was enough. \n\nIf you can tell your husband no and he accepts it, you're very lucky. Be confident enough that what you're doing is right for you  and your children. Others have posted, saying things about his abusive behavior and for you to leave. Please be careful if you think he will just accept what you say. Remember that your children see and hear more than you think.  Women  have more choices today and more places for help. I wanted you to be aware of the other side of the situation. You know him better than all of posting.  Stay strong!",

Staying with him, you'll have 4 kids and one of them has access to your credit.  \n\nBrushing past previous egregious behavior doesn't solve the problem.

Document everything that you can  about the financial situation so you can show that he will not be responsible to  make any support payment without the court or a lawyer being the one to accept and document his payments. He can’t ask a court or lawyer to give more time or tell them to shut up and take what you can get because thats all he wants to give. They will just file him as in contempt. Also document his interactions with the kids. He will most likely have to have supervised visits if he loses interest in them in short amount of time which means they can get hurt if left alone with him. I know it sounds harsh and time consuming but it will help you out a lot. Also if you have family or friends that can write a statement about his unstable behaviour and his lack of interaction with the kids, that will help too. Just make sure you have as much documentation as you can get your hands on to give a lawyer. Everything from his behaviour, to interactions with his kids and even how he handles finances can help you. Make sure you get all his accounts info including is 401k /pension info. You will be entitled to that. No one wants to go through a divorce but if you have to and can get the documents, do it so you have something to help you raise the kids and to build a safe environment for your kids. Best of luck. ——also I don’t know where you live or anything. What I recommend is what I was told when I went through my divorce so I would check with a lawyer to see if these would help.",

They smoked, had loud, inappropriate guests, and created a very unstable environment for my then 8 year old daughter. I knew that I needed to make enough money to have my own place without them. So I started quietly plotting my escape. I worked extra hard to finish my degree, then began job searching and doing interviews. Like magic, everyone started acting right and being courteous housemates. They could tell the tide had changed and that soon, I might not need them as housemates. Eventually, I landed my new job and bought my first home on my own! The point is- it is normal for people to change their behavior when they suspect it will no longer be tolerated or sustainable. If anything, it is proof that your husband is well aware of the toxicity of his behavior. I would continue to plan and plot your escape, and pull the trigger when the time is right.

You're already making the journey, the fact that he isn't contributing at all is such a red flag in my eyes. \n\n- Some people never want to live together with a partner (no matter what they might say). This model is called \"living apart together\" and yes, some people live like that even when married and having children - usually, they are then neighbors with their partner or live in apartments in the same building. The reasons to have separate places are many - no arguments about chores, having an \"alone space\" for people who need a lot of time alone to recharge, some people feel like it stops people from getting too comfortable in the relationship, some people just don't like to compromise when it comes to their living space in general, it could be for health reasons (sleeping issues when someone else lives with you, very different wishes when it comes to heat/cold)...\n\n- I think you should definitely find a place for yourself to escape your currently horrible living situation. This means you should also accept that he is showing and telling you constantly that he *doesn't* want to live with you. Which is valid, but it's just as valid that you want him to shit or get off the pot after five years. Generally, the fact that he is doing a \"one day\"-thing (as in \"I want kids one day, I want to move in together one day) means nothing at this point anymore. I don't think he was wrong to buy the apartment he liked - but the fact that he bought it just like that shows that he has no idea when \"one day\" will be and it's possible that it won't be coming, ever. Some people just like the *idea* of something, but are so happy with how things currently are that they don't want the change. And, quite frankly, since you keep travelling to him for free all the time, why would he want to change his comfy life when he's happy like this right now?\n\nSo honestly, I think you need to find your spine instead of just catering to his wishes (when it comes to the free travel to his place) and some faint hopes that one day, things might change. You need change *now* because your living situation is hell.",

And that's a scary thing, and so she actively suppresses and refuses to acknowledge what she already knows.\n\nWhat that *means* is:\n\nThere is nothing that you as an outsider can say to her that will cause her to suddenly realize that she's in an abusive relationship.  There's every likelihood that she already knows, and she's already ignoring that knowledge in order to keep herself safe from (what in her perception is) the even *scarier* prospect of losing him.\n\nIf you say *anything* negative about him to her, now she'll have to suppress/ignore what you're saying, which will be easy for her (because she's already doing it to her own internal voice of wisdom), and the easiest way for her to do that is to shut you out.\n\nThe only useful thing that you can do for someone who is adamantly clinging to an abuser is:  support *her*.  Always support *her*.  And do it in a way that *doesn't* make it seem like you are saying anything negative about *him*.\n\nIf she tells you something awful that he's done, say something that is supportive of her, and leaves him out of it:  \"I'm so sorry you're going through that.  How can I help you feel better?\"\n\nThe goal is for her to think of you as \"safe\", meaning that you have never forced her to have to face her own internal voice.\n\nBecause if (hopefully when) she's finally had enough and she realizes that she needs to get away from him, she's going to need help doing that.  And you want her to think of you as someone she can turn to, who won't judge her, won't say \"I told you so\"...someone who was simply always there for her.\n\nAnd when that moment comes, you *still* need to resist the urge to say anything negative about him, because when she gets to that moment, she will be teetering *right* on the cusp of do-I-leave-or-do-I-run-back-to-him, and if you say anything negative about him in that moment, she'll feel the urge to defend him...and then there's every chance that the mental gymnastics she'll have to go through in *order* to defend him  will tip her back toward the \"run-back-to-him\" side of the cusp.\n\nSo.  Support *her*.  Never say a negative *word* about him.  Just set yourself up in her life as the one who was always there for her without judgment or recrimination, so that when she needs help, she will have someone to turn to that she feels safe with.",

Our relationship (4 years +) was probably the most important relationship I’ve had in my life and I honestly don’t regret trying and doing it. They were perfect on paper is how I felt even early on, but as it turned out I truly craved that big crush, turning into something more. \nA few things from our relationship that might help you. A) we became polyamorous and reeeaaaallly liked it, worked great in this situation. We were each others stable home, while we were free to chase other feelings and types of relationships around that. I sympathize with your feeling here that it’s hard to imagine life without them. We have two cats and a place together, some great poly friends etc. now that we are broken up the relationship is different but not strictly over or broken, we’re still close friends. \nB) there was a lot of time in our relationship that we accepted we were essentially platonic. Our sex slowed way down and so did romance. We were comfortable and safe though. I think that can be good if it’s what both people want. I guess I trust myself and them now enough to not need that safety or comfort over say risk and excitement etc. if you’ve had a difficult past, don’t have great relationship tools, or otherwise don’t really trust your judgment out in the wild so to speak. A safe comfortable thing can be good for you and your your growth.\nWould this relationship work better to you as a best friendship , romantic but non sexual relationship, etc? I think is my question, in polyamory you can take all the good you see and pursue other relationships besides. It sounds like for you there’s all these positives so you don’t want to break up, I don’t think you need to honestly ! If those feelings (butterflies) are important to you see if you two can create them with extra games. Exploring kink, sharing and digging into that next level taboo stuff you might find butterflies there. Sounds worth it to overturn those rocks. The possibilities can really be endless, and this sounds like an awesome relationship and time to try stuff out! If you’re all the way in the comfort zone right now with this person push some boundaries! Push some limits! The relationship doesn’t sound so fragile that it couldn’t take it like many others on here. Think of that comfortable if boring place your in as the perfect platform to launch from. If your boyfriend thinks they can keep up and grow to all the better you can only find out !!!",

First, ending it now is better than ending it later - the longer it goes on, the messier the breakup gets. Second, LDRs are not for everyone, and that's ok. If that is what's happening here, it's not a big deal. Live and learn, and the important part of that is learn. You have learned they're probably not for you, and you should approach any future opportunities slowly and with caution.\n\nLDRs really only work if you are either both comfortable with the chances of you seeing one another in person being totally up in the air, or you guys have a plan and timeline for closing the distance. And at your age, you're going to be the first. You have way too many things ahead of you to be able to accurately predict and be comfortable with all that. You're probably going to go off to college soon, or at minimum experience pretty big life changes in the coming years. IMO there's zero reason to add on the burden of managing a long distance relationship.\n\nAll the LDRs that worked for longer than a year was because of several factors - we communicated often, enjoyed one another's company but were also loners and were happy just saying good morning and then do our own thing for the rest of the day, a pre-established relationship where we had been friends for over a year and had a good sense of our dynamic and personalities already, and we made plans to see each other, where my last one, I visited her about every six months.\n\nAnyway, ultimately, it doesn't matter if you're losing feelings or you're not into long distance. TLDR, if long distances are not for you, you've now learned this, or if you're losing feelings, it's better to end it now then drag it out.",

If anything, he will just get worse and even more withdrawn.\n\nFind someone who already has the qualities you desire in a partner, including at least some degree of emotional depth. Someone who makes you a priority and is willing to put some effort in a relationship. I mean, these are bare minimum standards lol. This will be a far more efficient use of your time than expecting someone to change who they are. \n\nAlso, for future reference, on an off relationships hardly ever work. Just let relationships end when you breakup the first time. 99/100 times it is not worth trying to revive it \n\nThis is why vetting during the dating stage is so important. You're young though, and still figuring out what you want so, I get it. On that note, spend some time for yourself where you really reflect on what you want in life and in a partner. Keep those standards up. You don't want to settle. This man is low effort and just not it. You can do better.",

I was dating someone as soon as the divorce papers were signed because I had already moved on. For nearly 2 years we constantly fought about having children, then horrific events that happened back to back (my mother dying unexpectedly and an ectopic pregnancy that required an emergency surgery) he was not there for any of it. No emotional nor physical support at all. I really started to realize how unhappy I was, I found someone else while at the gym (best way to release pent up pain and anger) and I vented to him all the time. We became gym buddies and eventually more. Like I said, I knew I deserved better and had stayed for so long, the events right before the divorce solidified what I was feeling. I got with the gym buddy and we actually moved in together within a month. I've always believed, you never truly know someone unless you live with them. We've been together two years now and getting married in October. At first, it was hard. I wasn't past the trauma or healed and I unknowingly brought up my ex all the time. It was just because he was what I was used to for so long. Eventually I grew out of that after he said something. We fought a lot at the beginning but I look back now and I see how far we've come. How patient he was with me. I didn't face my pain or heal alone. He helped me stand up again and realize what I'm worth. Everybody moves at their own pace and heals in different ways. I will say communication is detrimental. It will help tremendously. Talk to him about how you feel, if he's the right guy, he will respond in a calm and descriptive manner. He may even reflect on his behavior and do something. That's what I did and what my fiance did when I'd talk about things. Take things at your own pace but talk to him. Like I said he might say or do things unintentionally. Hope this helps. ",

What I'm telling you is that it's not what I am used to, because of the environment I grew up in, so even though it's not *wrong*, it still causes me anxiety\".\n\nMany years ago, I lived in Virginia, but I had a work trip one February that took me to San Diego.  The weather at home was, well, February-in-Virginia weather; it might not have been actually snowing when I left, but it was easily cold enough to have been.  So when I landed in San Diego, and the weather was 65 degrees, I immediately put on a short sleeved shirt and went outside to enjoy the weather...but locals (wearing actual parkas) were looking at me like I was either mentally ill, or homeless and unable to afford clothing; one person actually asked if I needed to get somewhere to get warm.\n\nWe become used to the environment we live in long-term.  If you are used to a reserved family interaction, even *moderate* discord will seem extreme to you.  If she is used to...exuberant family interaction, then the *same* moderate discord will seem either normal or maybe even super-chill to her.\n\nSo if she doesn't understand it if you explain it as I mentioned above, maybe see if you can find something that she has experienced were she was put into an environment that *she* was not used to and felt out of place as a result, and is that example as a way to express what you are feeling.",

Keeping the world at arm's length is definitely one way of avoiding the potential hurt that comes with the inherent vulnerability of being close to someone else, but it's not really the way to the happiest and/or healthiest life; humans literally evolved to form bonds and exist as a part of a community, rather than as solitary animals. \n\nRelationships grow and wane naturally as trust, care, time, and energy are invested or divested; forming attachments and investing too quickly is not a sign of emotional health. Also, pulling back several steps and choosing to keep someone at a distance (unless there was a significant issue) is not particularly healthy.\n\nGoing from talking to someone every day to only speaking to them when you see them in person is several massive steps back; this already seems like an overreaction on your part, given this whole incident as you describe it was not particularly significant, and has been sufficiently dealt with, by your own words.  \n\nBy your choice to keep the sister at arm's length over a misunderstanding, you're telling her that she's not that important to you, and that you don't care for her enough to want to invest your time or energy in a meaningful relationship beyond casual acquaintanceship any longer.  You're telling her that you think she's a bad investment.  There is no way this is NOT going to cause hurt feelings. \n\nDo with that information what you will.",

And both of those reactions are manipulative and a bad sign. They are signs of a controlling partner who does not want you to have a life outside of them.\n\nIt's really important to make sure you get alone time with your friends on a regular basis. The fact that you've only hung out 5 times in 8 months since you started dating your bf seems a little concerning, and I think you should be making more time for your friendships. If your bf is creating obstacles to that, again that is a sign that your partner is not somebody you should stay with.\n\nGood partners want you to be happy, and will want you to have a balanced life that does not involve them in every aspect of it. And more than that, good partners will make room for you to express something that you have a problem with (like your current issue) and will respect what you say.

        "body": "Ultimately, you have to decide what kind of person you want to be, and then hold yourself accountable to act in the way that you want to.  \n\nFeeling jealous usually boils down to being insecure, not being able to trust your partner, or being incompatible with your partner, or some combination of those things.\n\nIf you are insecure, you should work on your self esteem so that you can see the value in yourself that other people (including your partner) see. If you cannot trust your partner then you should probably just break up, because a relationship without trust is destined to fall apart. And if you and your partner have different ideas about what kinds of boundaries you want in a relationship, then that's probably a sign you are incompatible and should seek out somebody you're more on the same page with.\n\nPart of the way that you get more chill is by accepting that almost all relationships end. Every single relationship that anybody - including you - ever has is extremely likely to end in a breakup. If you date 50 people over the course of your life you will have at least 49 breakups maybe 1 that doesn't end that way. You have to accept that if your gf talks to this guy and they wind up hitting it off and she decides that she would rather be with him than you, then that will suck but it will also mean that there is somebody else out there who is a better fit for you and who will choose you every day over anybody. A dating relationship ending is sad, but it's also a potential to start over and find somebody who makes you even happier. When you can make room for things to not work out with your current gf, sometimes it can help take the pressure off and help you curb your jealousy.\n\nPart of what also needs to happen is you need to get better at handling your jealousy. Like, yes you can feel jealous, but then you can also acknowledge to yourself that the jealousy is coming from an irrational place, and then you can let go of that feeling and not let it affect your actions or your behaviour toward your gf. Trusting is not just about how you feel about your partner - a big part of it is also how you act toward your partner. If you are telling her to not talk to her friends or never talk to a boy outside of school or whatever, that is not trust, that's just control.\n\nIf you and your gf agreed that there were no opposite-gender friends and now she is friends with this guy, then either she has crossed the boundary and has shows you that this isn't the relationship for you, or maybe it's time to get rid of that rule (which frankly seems a little immature).",

This makes it confusing as to why you even want to fix your relationship with her when you seem to not care for her at all. \n\nWhat you've described is basically that you don't like her personality, like she is extroverted and expresses her emotions, and that annoys you. I'm not sure if this is accurate for you, but that's what I got from reading this. But that's also why more context would help.\n\nYou say she would be upset with you for waking up late. Okay, yeah, I get her perspective though, and I also get your perspective cause I imagine you being a teenager and disliking being yelled at by your mom. But unless she was verbally abusing you daily, I'm not sure how being upset with you sometimes for being late is enough to make you hate her the way it seems you do. \n\nYou also say she was hard on you for dropping out of college because of money that she lost, but again, I can understand that because if she paid and you didn't finish, it was literally money thrown away. I think it seems reasonable for a parent to be upset. And again, unless she did abusive stuff to you over it, I'm not sure why that equates to you viewing her so negatively. So, I reiterate that more context is needed.\n\nI really can't connect how she was so horrible to you that you actively dislike her so much. And then it seems you complained so much to your husband, and I'm guessing also maybe embellished to make it seem worse, that he hates her. I'm having a hard time really figuring out what's going on here. \n\nIf you don't want to elaborate, that's fine, but again, I'm just not seeing what happened, outside of you just simply not liking her personality, to make you dislike her so much that you also made your husband dislike her.\n\nI will say that inviting her into your home, and automatically being annoyed with her, and allowing your husband to yell at her, and then inviting her again just to do the same all over, is honestly a really crappy thing to do. \n\nI don't blame your mom at all for not wanting to come over again cause if it was me, I wouldn't ever step foot in your house again, nor would I really be interested in talking to you on the phone either when you seem to just immediately have disdain for her whenever you interact with her. \n\nThat's rough and makes you feel like shit, so people usually don't want to continue putting themselves in situations where they're made to feel like shit.\n\nAnd it kind of seems like you're doing it purposefully simply because you don't like her and want to hurt her. Which again leads me to question why you even want to repair a relationship with a person you seem to not like at all.\n\nI guess if you're really invested in fixing this, your best opportunity would've been the therapy your mother suggested. If she's still open to doing that now, then that would be a good first step to do together. You also would definitely need to set your husband straight by being honest about her in the event you embellished things to make her seem worse than she was. \n\nAnd even if not, you still need to communicate to him that you want to have a better relationship with her going forward, so he needs to give her a clean slate to work with. Cause if he doesn't and just continues to berate her at every opportunity, it won't really matter if you make progress with her yourself, cause she'll still be surrounded by negativity from him and probably won't want to be at your house or in his presence.\n\nI don't know, again, I'm very confused on why there's so much animosity towards your mom, unless there was abuse, which you didn't make clear. But if you really want to fix things with her, I'd start with the therapy she previously suggested and go from there.\n\nEdit: I forgot to add as a side note that I think it was kind of mean to accept money from your mom for your wedding while leaving her out of everything. I got the sense that it was more than just not letting her help, I get the feeling that you, your husband, and your husband's family were actively mean to her during the planning process, while also accepting a large chunk of money from her. I don't know, personally, it feels messed up to me. But again, that's because I didn't read any clear sign of why you hate your mom so much.\n\nOH! ALSO! The fact you were upset and called her dramatic for just flying home instead of \"cooling off\" ... your husband screamed at her and literally said YOU'RE NOT WELCOME, but you expected her to return to your house after that? I don't know, the more I re-read this, the more I think bottom line is you just don't like your mom as a person, and therefore I kind of think you should just let her be, rather than exposing her to you and your husband's vitriol.",

The biggest thing here is understanding that relationships do not just magically go back to what they were before when you have a baby. It takes effort on both your ends. It does not sound like you’re trying to make any effort to connect with her. Put down the phone. Ask what she means when she wants kissing and cuddling. Maybe she wants it to be free from sexual expectations and you’re not giving that to her. You two need to talk to one another, and likely get a therapist in there.",

Various medications can also influence sex drive. \n\nIt is possible that this is just how her libido is, but it might also be context specific. As a cis lady, my libido has been impacted by a host of factors throughout my life - stress, medication, physical ailments (and has also varied between relationships).\n\nNot saying it's likely, but worth considering. To me, your current situation sounds unsustainable if you feel resentment brewing, and ignoring it won't make it stop mattering to you (and you deserve to feel content in your life and relationship). \n\nIt might be good to have a frank conversation about it with her, just like you did here - emphasising that you don't fault her at all, definitely don't want to pressure her in any way (pressure to want sex can, unfortunately, make it way harder to get turned on). \n\nBut it does sound to me like it's a conversation worth having. Hopefully you two can work together to lay a plan for how to tackle this together. Maybe she sees a doctor, maybe she tries masterbating a bit more to try to learn what she likes without the pressure of pleasing a partner. Maybe you try to do little things to romance (not seduce) her - you know, little gestures that make her feel seen, loved, and appreciated. If she's stressed, maybe you try to take some stuff off her plate, maybe you masterbate a bit more to take pressure off of her.\nYou know the situation better than me, I'm just spitballing here.\n\nI hope you can figure it out. FWIW, I don't think it's doomed, but it'll probably take some work from both parties, and I recommend not waiting - in my experience, that usually just worsens whatever issue is there, and suddenly you gotta work through months/years of resentment, which is, you know, not fun.\n\nLastly, if it's available to you, couples counselling with a psychologist with experience in this sort of thing is worth considering (a sexologist might be cheaper if cost is an issue, but be mindful of credentials and reviews - sexologist is not a protected title in a lot of countries, so, you know, less oversight and no licensing process).",

So was meeting up just the two of them because her family member died. That’s not even with the lie about going.

But he doesn’t have to want to be in a relationship with her to have sex with her. It’s tricky when it comes to remaining friends with an ex. \n\nI think you have to decide if your relationship is worth the trouble. And this is something you’d be willing to deal with and worry about your entire relationship. Not specifically her but him not correcting other women that cross boundaries. Once someone lies, you have to question everything they say in the future and everything they’ve said in the past. That’s one reasons why it’s so hurtful. \n\nBest of luck 🖤",

I don’t know of any cyclists who are routinely out after dark that late. Does he share his routes with you? My husband does for safety reasons so that I could find him if his bike broke down. I can see where he is in real time. Any chance he’s up to some other type of activity?\n\nI grew up in a family of golfers and when we were dating I made it crystal clear that I would not be a golf widow. When he took up cycling in his 50s, I reminded him of that and that I wasn’t going to be a cycling widow either. When he does inconsiderate shit around cycling I remind him very pointedly. Mine tries to be reasonable.\n\nI think you should listen very carefully to what your husband is telling you with his actions. You have brought this up repeatedly. He clearly couldn’t care less about how this affects you and he cares much more about cycling than he does about you.\n\nPersonally I would let him have all the time in the world to be with his bike.

This will sound heartless, but if you divorce, I promise you, they'll get over it. They'll be upset, sure, your kids for a while definitely. But it is not their marriage or their life, and they will get over it a hell of a lot quicker than you think. Don't base your decision on any of them, make your decision for yourself, if it when you hit your breaking point. \n\nI was 11 when my parents divorced, and I stopped blaming either of them for it within a few weeks. My brother held out for the longest, and blamed our dad for a whole half a year. It's not to say that kids won't or don't resent their parents for it, but yours are already adults. And there is no cheating or abuse, it's just drifting apart. They won't blame you for that. And the grandkids, sorry to be a further jerk, also won't care in a few weeks, as long as your presence in their life doesn't change.\n\nNow ...all of that said....and I really do hate to follow that up with saying this, but hun, you can either continue blindly forward and leave on good terms, or you can check his phone and email and your bank accounts. Cause this is too long, too consistent, too extreme for a 60 yr old man, for me to believe it's a physical hobby like cycling. He would need rest, he would get injuries, he would take breaks...I'm not saying it's not *also* cycling, but I would bet large sums of money that it is more, and he is getting up to something shady. (Editing my post to add - I know a 62 yr old cycling addict. He's pulling in an entire month, around the hours your husband apparently does in a week. And he semi-regularly has to take breaks for random injuries. Either way, his schedule is to commute to and from the office on bike, and one big weekend ride a week. But that's only 3-5 hrs, not maybe 7 a day. Your husband is lying to you, this isn't possible. But him cheating, doing drugs, or gambling is significantly more possible.)",

        "body": "I had a partner like this. It sounds like whenever he has Big Feelings about something he expects you to jump in and manage them for him. Do you feel safe with him? Not just physically, but also emotionally - do you feel comfortable bringing up things you’re upset about, or would he just make it about himself? Personally, this kind of relationship was veeeeery draining for me and I felt like a whole new person once we separated. He just dragged me down, when I wasn’t having to fight and defend simple things day in and day out. \n\nThe “there it is” is also a red flag to me - it sounds like he has quite the low opinion of you, and like your fights are very “me vs you” and not very “us vs the problem” (and tbh the problem sounds very minor, almost like he’s trying to pick fights for some reason or another). Your fights aren’t healthy. And the trust issues! It’s ok for someone to be insecure or jealous but it’s not your responsibility to take care of his feelings to your detriment. it’s one thing if you’re like flirting with people or having a weird relationship with your ex or something, quite another to feel like you have to constantly tip toe around him, which is what it sounds like. You’re the same age, why do you have different expectations for y’all? You have to stay patient and manage his emotions for him, while he gets to act out and be mean. Your partner should not be mean to you!! In any circumstance!!! Even in an argument!! I’m so sorry that you feel like you have to put up with someone that sounds so draining and miserable.\n\nI think you should take a moment to stop and reflect. Are you truly happy? Do you feel loved, safe, and respected unconditionally? Not just “sometimes” or “when he’s in a good mood” or “when I don’t fuck up.” But all the time. \n\nI’m not going to tell you to break up because that’s a decision that you need to come to on your own, and I don’t know your life and relationship like that. But it sounds like he’s dragging you down, and if I were your friend I’d tell you snap out of it and that it’s hard (god it’s hard) but it’s worth it.",

I am guessing he is mean a lot more often than you, and that makes me wonder why you feel that you are less deserving of care than he is? Why do you have to be the one to micromanage every interaction in order to prevent him from lashing out?\n\n>Unfortunately, it always spirals into “If I was the only guy in your life, you’d act differently,” regardless of what we’re arguing about. No matter how much I try to calm him, he escalates and doesn’t calm down until I break down completely or cry.\n\nAgain, would you ever do the things that he is doing to you? Would you consider that acceptable behaviour for yourself? If not, why do you consider it acceptable behaviour for your partner?\n\nHe is toxic and a bully and a manipulator. He uses his temper and aggression and guilt trips to control you on a regular day-to-day basis. Do you ever give your friends the full details of what he did when things happen like what went down this morning? If so, what do they say about his behaviour and the way he talks to you? If you don't give them the full details of stuff like that, I wonder why that is - do you deep down know that it is unacceptable and don't want to be judged by them for staying with a guy who treats you like this? Are you embarrassed to date somebody who would talk to you like that?\n\n>Should I be more considerate next time? What can I do to make it better?\n\nLiterally nothing. The problem is him and his controlling behaviour and his lack of emotional regulation. This is 100% completely outside of your control. All the things you already do like trying to walk on eggshells are you having to overcompensate for his lack of emotional maturity.\n\n>He said he calmed down because he realized I was right and he had to control his emotions more, but is he just saying what I wanna hear?\n\nEven if he is not just saying what you want to hear and really means it, there is a long ways to go to get from \"I need to control my emotions more\" to actually having control over your emotions. Those are very easy words to say and very hard ones to follow through on. He would have to decide that rather than idly talking about it, that he actually wants to make a huge change in his life and overhaul the way he interacts with the world on a fundamental level. It would mean getting therapy to learn coping mechanisms and strategies and cultivate more maturity and emotional intelligence. It would mean holding himself accountable in a way he has not shown the ability to do so far in 3 years. If he actually decides he wants to do all this, *and* follows through on it, I think he might get to a place where he can have a healthy relationship in 3 or 4 years. But he will do a lot more damage to you and your relationship along the way to getting it there. And at the end of that period, your relationship will be left with so much baggage that you both will have dramatically more success just starting over fresh with somebody new.\n\nYou should not stay together. You deserve a better relationship. Break up and keep him out of your life.",

In the past you know that his actions have not always backed up his words. That was a dynamic that you were able to pick up on over a timeline of several years.

I think there's a world in which he is *way* better, but still not a good enough fit with you to be a great long-term partner. I think you should keep that possibility in mind as you explore reconnecting. And I think that while things are good right now, you should come up with some past behaviours that you saw or dynamics you had with him that, if they pop up again in the future, you would choose to end the relationship. And then you should follow through if those things come up.\n\nIn terms of talking to your family about this, something that may be useful is to express that you understand what was happening before was not healthy, and that you both have been putting in work on yourselves and are only going to stay together if things can actually be healthy. Ultimately that will not ease their concerns that much in the moment - the real thing that will ease their concern is seeing a consistently healthy relationship between you two over a longer timeline.",

It felt like there were whole parts of me he didn't know and didn't have curiosity for.\n\nWhat ended up happening was that we went through some really hard things together. It brought up a lot of painful conflict, but by slowly working through that conflict it seemed to open a depth to the relationship that wasn't there before. Some of my husband's surface level stuff was happening because he lacked skills for managing strong and painful emotions and he avoided them by never digging deep or taking the time to look inside. The nature of our conflict basically gave him the choice of immersing himself in this emotional world for the sake of the relationship or part ways and keep the status quo. He chose to dig deep.\n\nOne thing I will say about my work in our relationship is that I needed to learn to lighten up sometimes. Not everything needs to be serious, deep, or analyzed. What I've discovered is that there is a whole realm of intimacy that comes from playfulness that I was ignoring because I was comfortable with the \"deep\" stuff. My husband was good at meeting me with fun and lightheartedness and I had to grow some skills for letting things go and being goofy.

She finds peace in the simple things. In a way, I don’t blame her. The world is heavy. And sometimes I wish I could live in that space too. I envy her bubble some days.\n\nBut I feel things deeply. I think deeply. I miss those conversations where you lock eyes with someone and you know they want to explore your thoughts. Where you feel seen. Curious. Pulled in. That kind of connection hits different.\n\nSo if this is what you’re craving, you’re valid for it. But try starting small. Ask him things that don’t feel like pressure.

For example, if he gets laid off from his job, then you might see he is more passionate about his work than you realized (or hopefully it is something positive that happens; that is just the first example that popped into my head).",

While 6 months feels like a long time, I think it is still reasonable for still exploring the surface level. Sometimes it takes people (who are not used to these conversations or mental exercise) to actually consider what you are talking about and apply it to themselves. \n\nAlso, sometimes people are very physical/present (like out-of-sight-out-of-mind), meaning they will talk about art after visiting a museum, or talk about comedy after seeing a show, or discuss their philosophical ideas after watch a doco on socrates, or talk about their ambition after going to a local 'ted talk'. \n\nI would consider trying to do some experiences together about a deep thing you are interested rather than theoretical discussion. It may provide a 'break through' for your communication. Or it will help you to evaluate and decide on the mismatch. \n\nIf you read r/askmen you'll see complaining about how men often can't open up to their GF about anything because they will use it later in a crushing argument to hurt them. This seems to be quite a common experience. Perhaps this is also playing a role and he has been 'trained' not to actually share his thoughts. You may have to have a straight discussion about wanting to be deeply known, and wanting to know him deeply. And that you want to build trust around not using those inner thoughts as ammunition in the future (ask how to make that trust).\n\nI remember having to speak with my boyfriend about our discussions of issues. He would present the argument from the video/presenter we had watched, I would present my personal view. I wanted to know what HE thought, not what the video/speaker said. I don't even think he realised what he was doing, but he has changed his communication style and our talks are better now.\n\nAnyway, just some thoughts here. I would give him some more time, but I think boring is a valuable relationship feature (feels reliable and comfy) that acts as a good baseline. Makes it somewhat easy to shake things up! \n\nBest of luck!",

It is good to support a partner who is struggling but you also need to be met halfway. A relationship should not leave you feeling constantly unseen or insecure.\n\nWhat you can do is first have one final honest conversation letting him know how deeply this is affecting you and that if nothing changes, you can not keep investing your time and love into something one-sided. Second, set a clear boundary, give yourself a realistic time frame and observe if his behaviour aligns with what he says. Third, focus on your self-worth, remind yourself that you deserve a relationship where love feels safe, mutual and consistent. Fourth, be prepared to walk away if things remain the same, leaving is not giving up, it is choosing yourself.\n\nYou deserve more than waiting around for someone to remember how to love you.

Yet she continues to engage in very socially inappropriate behavior, like trauma dumping and using connections to get jobs and then burning that connection. \n\nIf you stop being her friend, she is going to spend zero amount of time honestly reflecting on what she may have done to contribute to it. She is going to move on to the next person, the next crisis, the next person to inflict herself on. She can easily life the rest of her life like that. Many people do. Her financially protected circumstances make it even easier for her not to experience consequences of her actions. \n\nIf you send her a long text about why you can't be her friend, it will just be the next crisis. She will forward it to all your friends. She will trauma dump about you. She will cry about how she losses friends. She will hear nothing of the content in it. \n\nSo you should instead do one of two things. If you aren't going to see her much in life moving forward, just let her know you're too busy for a call, and move on with life. No need to declare the friendship over, if you're not expected to see and interact with her regularly. \n\nBut if you are going to be seeing and interacting with her regularly, don't send her a long text about the friendship. Tell her that you feel like your friendship revolves around her and her crisis, and you're going to take a step back from it because you've realized it's been really draining for you. If you do have to see and interact with her in the future, being polite but distant will track with saying that you are trying to avoid drama. \n\nBut it sounds like you will probably not regularly see her. So I would just take a step back mentally, stop responding quickly or at all to texts, let her know you are not available for calls, and she will probably find another mark.",

You don't want to feel like you had to pull teeth to get him to agree to your plan. Perhaps you could stand to meet him halfway on this since as you said, when you first discussed this, being engaged by year three was only a \"loose\" plan, and not something set in stone. It can be hard to foresee what things will come up that far in advance. Things usually don't go exactly as planned in life, and that's not necessarily a sign that it's never going to happen.

She broke up with me, and I hope she finds what she’s looking for now on the timeline she wants. \n\nYou should analyze whether you love this man, or you love the idea of your timeline. If you love this man, you can say to him: I love you for you, no matter the timeline, you know where I stand, and when you’re ready to commit I want to take that leap with you. And then, in a non manipulative way, I would recommend giving him that emotional space to take that leap. Not sure what that looks like and I believe it’s not manipulation. He is saying all the things that indicate that he too wants what you want - he just needs the space to pursue you on a timeline that makes him feel comfortable. You already are at the point where you’re ready - you have to wait for him to be ready. \n\nMarriage is only a two yes situation. Both people have to make that leap. \n\nHowever if you make the decision that you want your timeline - break up with him. Just keep in mind the man you get on your timeline might not nearly have the connection you have with this man, nor be the quality of man that you have right now. And your life might not look like how you are envisioning it will be. But it sounds like that’s the risk you’ll have to take if you want things exactly how you want it when you want it.",

Truly, long distance relationships are very hard to keep alive. This situation may be good for now, but he may not want to keep this going if you guys are separated.",

There is nothing wrong with that, where the pressuring may come in is that it sounded kind of like an ultimatum. Not in a mean way, again I think these conversations are hard to have. \n\nOn top of that, if he didn’t propose at the end of this year, how would you feel? Would you stay? I know what you said in your post, however is that where you truly draw the line? It can be scary to restart. On the same note, don’t let your boyfriend keep you from your husband. But genuinely, if he does not propose, are you leaving? And is marriage a common goal for the both of you? Some people do not aspire to be married, it scares them. \n\nMy suggestion is to dig deeper and have these tough conversations now, is marriage a common goal? What do your timelines look like and where do they differ? What can you both do to continue to move forward to these goals as a couple? Therapy may be something to look into as well. There is no shame in having a completely unbiased mediator in these conversations. They are hard and sometimes awkward. But all of the hard conversations now mean less issues in the future imo.

My now fiancé was clear on her expectations, I was too, but in the back of my mind it was still a huge commitment to make and I needed to be more than 100% certain it was what I wanted when things started to get real. In my experience, the transition from earlier talks to actually thinking about buying a ring, planning an engagement, and making a commitment to my partner for the rest of my life felt overwhelming and there was a lot of weight on my shoulders - it’s one of the biggest decisions two people will make that changes the course of their entire life. With that said, anxiety is caused by inaction. Once I started actually making plans, looking at rings, finding the perfect one, it was a time of reflection for myself to realize I wanted nothing and no one else. Actually going through the process gave me clarity. Give him some time, address how he feels and how you support his decision either way and want him to feel safe and how it’s his choice at the end of the day. He’s probably soul searching before a huge commitment, and he’ll find his way. That was my experience, and every day since has been filled with such joy, excitement and love. Good luck!",

People change over time, and if they don't work together to handle small problems, worries, or concerns, then the couple grows apart. Unfortunately, your ex wasn't a good communicator, which wasn't fair to you. He decided what was best when it should've been a \"we decided ...\". \n\nMove forward because he treated you horribly. If someone acts selfishly and can't communicate, they're not good for anyone. Why give a bad person a second chance? Grieve the relationship you had, and don't grieve the person who he became. He chose to grow apart. I'm sure you have some part in things not working, and you should take the time to learn from it and become a better person. Know that who you are in love with isn't the man today. You are in love with the man you first met. When it comes to relationships, second chances VERY rarely work out. It's rare enough that most people will never meet someone who has had a second chance to work. You have better odds playing the lottery. Besides, why would you date an asshole? \n\nHit the gym, read, mourn the relationship, and give yourself time to reflect and grow. Your future person is out there waiting for the right moment to meet you.",

You do you, but that sounds like a REALLY bad idea.\n\nI think it's OK to keep dating him for a bit, if you truly think it's just the emotional upset of dealing with his mother's serious illness that's caused him to become far less affectionate and increasingly irritated with you.  But it's also possible that your relationship was never built to go the distance.  Long-term relationships depend on increasing intimacy - the emotional kind, not the physical kind.  That deepening emotional connection bridges the gap and eventually replaces the feel-good hormonal surge of a Shiny New Love.  Those endorphins tend to wear off after the first year or so - the so-called honeymoon period, and you're right on schedule for it to end.   It's quite possible that your BF's feelings were primarily based in physical attraction and infatuation, rather than a deep and long-lasting love based on shared interests and values.\n\nThe semi-good news?  You may have discovered his true personality BEFORE you married him, while you still have time to change your mind!\n\nWith modern medical advances, his mother could live on with a chronic cancer condition for decades.  If this is a far cry from the adult life you had planned for yourself, and your BF can't manage to find his way back to treating you with love and respect, no one would blame you if you decided to break off the engagement, end the relationship, and move on.  This is the only life you're ever going to get, OP.  It sounds like you're making major personal sacrifices, and giving a whole lot more love than you're receiving from your partner.",

You could have continued to have conversations with her about the lack of intimacy until a solution was reached, or until a decision to end the relationship was met, but you didn’t. Instead you signed up for whatever dating app and cheated on her. And now she has to live knowing that her husband cared more about getting his rocks off than actively and consistently working with his wife, the one he vowed to commit to, to find a solution. I do believe it could have been fixed before, but now irreparable damage has been done. She doesn’t owe you her sexual intimacy when you couldn’t even provide her with the emotional intimacy she needed. She shouldn’t have needed to be hurt for you to realize that you weren’t providing her with what she needed. Is it that really that you love and care about her or that you just don’t want to be alone? My answer is that loving and caring for someone takes a lot more than what was done here. Those who love someone do everything in their power to address and fix things, or end it if there isn’t a solution. They don’t cheat.",

Moreover, I think that concerns 2 and 3 actually contribute to you not wanting intimacy.\n\n\nI also feel that the dynamic you've described is more of a caregiver/dependant than of equal partners. You carry twice the mental load, you don't connect on a deeper level (how can you if he literally \"has no thoughts\"?), you can't count on him even for such mundane things as someone taking your seats. \n\n\nProbably, you would like him to change. To realize that he has a lot to work on and actually do the work. However, this is not going to happen. Firstly, such change require a ton of work. Therapy is hard work changing the patterns in the brain and he hasn't as much as acknowledged his problems. Secondly, he faces no consequences for his actions/inactions. You stayed with him, didn't you? You still agree to provide emotional and mental labor to accommodate him. So chances of him changing a practically null. Aren't you afraid to spend all your life like this, unheard, unnoticed, undesired, carrying the double load?..\n\n\nYou're very right to panic but you're not panicking enough. He will never advocate for you or take the responsibility. Never.\n\n\nAs for him having done nothing wrong... Here is the list of what he did do wrong:\n- he refuses to make effort to connect to you\n- he doesn't want to engage in meaningful conversation with you\n- he is content with you carrying the double emotional and mental load\n- he chooses not to face his emotions knowing it negatively affects you\n- he chooses not to improve his communication skills\n- he refuses to acknowledge his shortcomings \n- he makes no effort to build intimacy\n- he refused to protect you\n- he is emotionally manipulative (especially with guilt).\n\n\nYou know, sometimes one can describe their partner as \"laying in a starfish position\" during sex.

I never had an affair either or put her in the situation where she’d be concerned. Flip the script and totally different. I learned the pattern of behavior that simply put her in the position to deflect, partial truth, defensive. All to make it done with as quick and as painless as possible as it pertained to her. What did I learn without worry of being wrong?\n\nIf you love her you know the answer. You actually said it, “I get really weird feeling in my gut”. Lean on that brother and trust it and never doubt it. Secondly, I’ve grown to the conclusion that in a pickle that deals with unexpressed feelings, emotions or actions. There’s 3 types of ladies. \n1. She just values herself and you and doesn’t do it. So no spider sense. \n2.She does and immediately regrets it, faces you out of respect and regret. Willing to do whatever it takes to either end the relationship or mend it. \n3. Then there’s #3…does it and pretty much a chronic liar and cheat. Typically as result of poor upbringing, lack of respect and necessary examples that would mitigate such behavior. Sad part is they are always the victim. Defensive and turn it around as if though the partner is the burden and issue. They’ll never respect you but will hold onto the relationship for as long as they can. No woman just enjoys acting sideways. I love my ex wife and always will. Would’ve stayed with her through anything. But her turmoil she dealt with growing up triggered season after season of pour choices (before and during our marriage). So what ended it? I leaned on my dignity, faith and personal values and wouldn’t allow her to play a broken record in response. I didn’t let up but I didn’t harass her. That was the end of the line for me. How dare I expect my wife to be true, honest and accountable. \n\nBut I’ll say this…many of the things I found out for myself. Things she lied and denied and hid from us. Didn’t warrant that response to it coming to light. It was like lying was just a normal part of functioning. She filed and cleared…I was divorced for a month and didn’t even know lol! Worst season of my life right now. I miss her terribly but I’d rather dine alone than with her..why? Cause I can trust the company. \n\nMy recommendation stay calm and balanced but be definitive. Ask clear out and show her why you question it. Point out to her where her own actions led you to that crossroads. If she still deflects and shows your union no respect, priority or value above all (especially another man). Pack a bag and begin your journey. If she loves your union more than her emotions. She’ll do the right thing I’m sure. \n\nOr do what I did.,..corner him and respectfully mandate a truth. But if your instincts are saying somethings wrong to include her blowing you off like that. Without a doubt there’s something she’s hiding. May not be a full blown sex affair. But to me, deliberately withholding important things. Like exterior connections with men outside your circle or even in it. It’s cheating and no different than walking and finding her in bed with another man. \n\nMy only regret within my marriage. Was not walking away and defending my moral values and my respect and decency. Trust me",

That said, it’s okay to feel torn—love can make these moments feel heavier than they are. But here’s the thing: a healthy relationship should breathe. Being apart for a few weeks isn’t a threat—it’s an opportunity.\n\nInstead of guilt, try to reframe it: Would you want him to feel bad for visiting his family after years apart? Exactly. You’re not abandoning him, you’re going home to refill a part of your soul. And truthfully, if he’s emotionally struggling with being alone for a short time, that’s something he should reflect on too—it’s not on you to carry both of your emotions all the time.\n\nHere’s something that helps: ask yourself, “If my younger sister or best friend were in this exact situation, what would I tell her?” Probably something like: “Go. Be with your people. Love is still here when you get back.”\n\nMaintain the connection—FaceTime, sweet little voice notes, funny updates. But don’t overcompensate. You don’t need to prove your love just because you’re going away. Let him miss you a little. Missing someone isn't a bad thing—it reminds us how much we value them.\n\nWishing you peace, perspective, and a joyful reunion on the other side. 💛",

When you try to have a simple conversation with him about taking accountability or suggest that he reflect on his actions, or ask him to change his behavior in some way, he may view it as an attack to his character. He will take that perceived attack to his character as a betrayal, but he won’t have the words or understanding to name what that feeling is. So he lashes out in a fit of rage in an attempt to silence you and make the bad feelings he’s having go away. You’re making him feel uncomfortable emotions and he doesn’t know how to recognize them, so he’s reacting in the only way that he knows how: by throwing a tantrum. When he was a child and didn’t get his way, he threw a tantrum and eventually his parents relented or he was soothed in some way. It’s the same now. When he throws these tantrums, don’t relent and don’t sooth him. You’re not his mother and he needs to learn how to manage his emotions like a grown up. \n\nTherapy isn’t going to help unless he’s committed to hard work and dedication to truly understanding the way his actions can affect others and how making others unhappy is a bad thing to do.

But they can stop the urge to lash out even if they feel hurt, and measure their response. He is lacking emotional regulation skills. He can't feel an emotion and decide whether it's rational or not, he just feels an emotion and acts on it immediately the way a toddler does.\n\nI don't think he means the mean things he says, but the issue is that he keeps saying them. He needs to prepare for the wave of defensive feelings and keep his mouth shut until the emotions subside.\n\nThere isn't much you can do one therapy session in. Because he may do this in therapy too, and be closed feedback and just get defensive.\n\nIn the meantime, he doesn't need to know why he does it, he just needs to know it's wrong to do. He needs to practice some self control and not say the first thing that comes through his head.\n\nWhat would happen if you both managed this reaction by knowing he needs time to let that wave of emotion pass before responding. He knows it's going to come. He knows he shouldn't speak while he's feeling it. Is he not capable of feeling a wave of negative emotion without keeping himself from lashing out?\n\nWork on preparing him for that experience. If you're going to talk to him about something, tell him first \"I need to talk to you about something.\" Let him prepare for the fact that he will have a wave of emotion and he needs to let that pass before you talk. Tell him what you need to, and give him space if he needs before you talk about it calmly.\n\nBecause it doesn't matter if he means it or not, it does harm to say those things out loud to you. It harms your relationship for you to have to hear them. And that harm isn't undone when he takes it back a moment later. If he doesn't want to harm the relationship, he needs to bite his tongue for a few moments and wait until he calms down to speak. Does he think that it doesn't matter what he says in the moment, as long as he takes it back later? Ask him.\n\nHe needs to take therapy serious, share with you what he's learning about himself, and why he does things, and show an ability to change his behavior. He needs to accept his pattern of behavior and work to break the pattern by keeping his mouth shut while he's feeling intense emotion.\n\nWhether or not he does this, and does it successfully, doesn't mean you need to continue in this relationship. Sometimes by the time someone breaks down and accepts help or goes to therapy, the damage is done and the years of refusing to change have taken their toll. He has be willing to damage your relationship over and over through the years, and expected you to just accept it and forget it. That damage is done even if he changes tomorrow.",

Additionally, we often think we are more important in others’ lives than we really are. Given that you’ve sent all those texts without receiving a reply, there isn’t much more you can do. Focus on living your life. If you see her again, you can say hello, but you don’t have to initiate the conversation.",

You don't have to do a song and a dance. Just showing up means a lot to most people (which you're doing). You also encouraged him to reach out to his other friends who have more experience with dealing with these things, which is also a form of support and no small thing!

So, I'm not sure what your boyfriend's preferences are there, but sometimes it can help to have a direct conversation about that in order to meet his needs (or confirm whether you are or not) rather than just assuming. \n\nIt sounds like your boyfriend may also just feel emotionally drained by the time you get there, so he doesn't always delve into details with you. It's not necessarily that he's trying to shut you out or he fears you seeing that side of him (though it could be - but once again, this is an assumption without talking about it), but I can see how it could make you feel that way. \n\nIt's not selfish or whining to have your own feelings. Just because your boyfriend is grieving right now doesn't mean your feelings aren't also important and that he wouldn't want to hear how you've been feeling. You can both support and be supported. \n\nYou can tell him that you feel insecure that you're not doing enough and ask him if there's anything more he want/needs from you with all of this. Or anything else that is on your heart to share. It sounds like keeping it from him has maybe been creating anxiety in him anyway, because he thinks \\*he\\* did something wrong.

But saying \"go back to therapy\" while dodging your own role in causing your partner to have a meltdown, not cool. \n\nYou aren't ruining your relationship. His reactions are whats creating a rift. You came to visit him and he ignored you, so you left the room he was ignoring you in. I believe you when you say you didn't do anything to make him think you had an attitude about it. Have you had passive aggressive moments in the past? Is he passive aggressive in the way that he accused you of being when you left the room? \n\nLook, hes supposed to know you well enough after 2 years to know what triggers you emotionally and how to react when you get upset. But he doesn't seem to. So either he wasn't paying attention or he doesn't care to. Neither are great options. \n\nI do think therapy would be great for you. It'd be great for everyone. I'm not sure a partner who projects onto you and reacts to you the way he does is a good fit for you though.",

This is him being a bad partner to you with bad communication.\n\nI don't necessarily see a lot of him working on being better mentioned in this post. Is that something you two have talked about? If you are a person who cries easily, it's a good idea to make sure you wind up with somebody who can handle that emotionally and not make you feel even worse in those moments. I'd also consider that maybe there is something about this particular relationship that has you on edge, and seeking out a partner who doesn't make you feel that way could make your life a lot happier.",

You should not have children with this person and you should also probably not be dating this person.\n\nLet's put aside the crazy family for a moment. When you bring problems to your girlfriend, she *runs away* from you into another room. She's so averse to either hearing criticism about herself and/or talking out relationship issues that she is literally, physically running away from them. How could you ever hope to work out disagreements and overcome obstacles in life with such a person?\n\nNow, let's get to the parents. Your girlfriend's dad, though odious and possibly dangerous, is apparently not a problem unless your girlfriend invites him to be so - he does not reach out. But she deliberately chooses to invite this chaos and potential danger into her life by reaching to *him*. She is so far in that she reached out to invite him to her girls night out birthday party. She is submissive to him, which means she is not ever going to stand up to him. If you have children with her, he will always be in your life, and you will not be able to get rid of him or really avoid him - because his presence is controlled solely by someone who runs away from the idea of standing up to him.\n\nYou have to accept the reality of who your girlfriend is today, not who she would be if she followed the ideal path, especially if she shows no indication that she agrees that even is the ideal path.",

Instead of seeing this as an opportunity to get out of her everyday life, she decided to instead see it in a negative light - and yet, she still decided to come over. This is on her and you are most definitely not a bad host.\n\nAs for S, I do wonder, however, if you're not just overthinking things. I can completely understand why someone would want to use their own perfume - something they picked out because they love the scent - over the perfume of someone else, which they very likely don't enjoy as much, just to make an example. \n\nI do think that the situation where you said you are not interested in people from your school anymore might have given them bad vibes, though. That's honestly something that would also make me go \"Ooof\" - and I am also not interested in how my old classmates are doing. However, it does give off a certain... vibe to say it like you did. \n\nI am trying to put it into words, but what I feel is sort of... a) By saying that you don't care how people from your past are doing, it is possible that the two friends felt included in that group. As in, they felt you said that you don't really care about them anymore, either. Also, b), you should have probably phrased it more like \"I am not in contact with anyone else from highschool anymore\" instead of what you said. Because the way you said it does feel... snobbish? Dismissive? Arrogant? I don't really know how to say it. At least in written form, it gives off a \"I don't give a shit about people who I don't see every day anymore, even if they maybe still care about me. Out of sight, out of mind. Fuck the past, look at the life I have now, what do I care whom I hung out with yesterday. Don't give a shit if they die of cancer, I barely remember their names anymore anyway.\"\n\nThat said, I am not surprised that you guys don't \"click\" as well anymore if you are basically long-distance friends now. You have all likely changed a lot over the years, so instead of being the girls you once were, you are now adult women, with everyone struggling with their own shit. And if you don't really hang out enough anymore to truly share your lives with each other anymore, then you don't really \"see\" what the other person has going on anymore. Much like you might not know much about your boss' personal struggles, distance can, without you wanting it to be this way, automatically change \"friends\" to \"aquaintances\", simply by all of you basing your friendship off of the \"old yous\", the teenagers from a decade ago.\n\nSo the time to let go of a friendship is when the person your friend has become isn't someone you enjoy hanging out with anymore. Staying in contact for \"old time's sake\" is not enough if you don't enjoy the women they have become. If you feel like you still love the people they are *now*, then you might want to make an attempt to communicate more in everyday life to grow closer again and be more part of each other's lives. But if that feels like a hassle or like something that won't work over the distance, then it might be time to let go, mentally thank them for being part of your life in the past and move on.",

The time in a person's life between ages 18 and 25 are the single period where s/he will change more than in *any other similar amount of time* in his or her entire adult life.\n\nWe *all* did stupid stuff when we were teenagers.  We *all* did stupid stuff when we were 20.  \n\nIf we tried to base our mid-twenties and later relationships on what a potential partner did when s/he was a *teen*...pretty much no one would measure up and we'd all just have to stay single forever.\n\n> he had wandering eyes and started to seem just not crazy interested in me\n\nIt sounds as if there was never any malice there, he never set *out* to try to hurt you.  He was just a dumb kid who hadn't figured out who he wanted to be in the world, yet.\n\nI've been happily married now for over twenty years, and I can tell you that all of the stuff you describe this guy as doing...I did all of the same stuff (and worse).\n\nI was *worthless* as a late-teens/early-twenties guy.\n\nBut I grew up.  And I'm a different person.  And anyone who judged me solely by who I was *as* a teen would never get to see any of that.\n\nSo if you are interested in giving this a shot, be *cautious* (as you should be in any new relationship), but don't assume that he's the same guy who's going to do the same stupid stuff that he did when he was a teen.  \n\nAnd if you do try, and he *shows* you that he's not the same guy he used to be, then don't hold who he was all those years ago against him; all that will do is suck the joy out of the present.",

        "body": "So not the exact situation, but one of my ex's was a trans woman who had just started transitioning when we met. I am AFAB and non-binary/gender queer. We had a close relationship and we're committed to one another but she eventually started feeling like she wanted to be with a man. I tried to step up in a lot of ways to create more of the dynamic she was looking for, but it didn't make up for the fact that I wasn't a man. She ended up breaking it off with me which I was heartbroken about. My mental health wasn't the best at the time as well. It was the first time I'd lost a relationship that was positive, which is a different kind of loss than a relationship that ended because things weren't going well. It was tough but I got through it.\n\nIt sounds like you're running up against an incompatibility with your current partner, and it might be one that you can't move past. It's okay to go find something that works better for you, even if there's something good where you are. You don't hear about that kind of situation very often so I think we sometimes feel that it's selfish. As much as it hurt at the time, I'm glad my ex broke it off with me when the relationship stopped working for her. It set me free to find someone that could more fully choose me. \n\nThe last thing I'll leave you with is a piece of advice I got when I broke it off with a partner that was often suicidal and even tried to commit suicide when I broke up with them. Ultimately we need to have boundaries where we leave the responsibility of keeping one's self alive to the individual people themselves. Or in other words, it's all our own responsibility to keep ourselves alive. We can be caring people that do things like call 911 or bring someone to the emergency room, but if someone ends their life, it's their final responsibility, not ours. Otherwise, we can drive ourselves crazy trying to stop people from hurting themselves and that isn't fair. Staying in a relationship with someone because they might hurt themselves is self-betrayal, not something compassionate.\n\nGood luck out there! You got this ♥️",

It’s okay to have personal space, but expecting you to change something that’s natural for you and saying “game over” feels harsh. Relationships need patience and understanding, especially when you’re still learning each other. You should talk openly and maybe set some boundaries that work for both of you. ❤️‍🩹 Don’t stress too much, you deserve kindness.",

As a guy, the very concept of anniversaries is on the silly side. I can understand yearly, but even that is an arbitrary number. Is there a 6 and 3/4th month anniversary? Is there 13 month or does it switch to a yearly calendar then? What I'm getting at is while it may seem very obvious to you(and, admittedly it might be ingrained in societal norms,) he might not be giving a second thought.\n\nAs for the rest of your post: the only thing I can say is that relationships are work. They're not easy, and they're never going to be easy. It's not going to be \"we communicated this once and now we're perfect for each other;\" it's constant work. Not everyone is made for each other, sure, but I also think a lot of people are giving up way too quickly when something -anything- goes wrong. \n\nThe only thing you can do is sit him down and very seriously lay out your feelings and thoughts on the matter in a calm but firm manner. Don't do it over text, or phone, or talk to him while he's busy with something else. Sit down in a room with no distractions and be clear that you want to talk about something very serious. Say the entirity of your peace before letting him weigh in or respond. Let him know how important these things are you to if the relationship is to work in the long term; and I mean plain, straight forward language, not the \"subtle hints\" or \"I would appreciate it if you maybe did x sometimes,\" I mean CLEARLY say how important something is to you and why you're bothered by things he hasn't done recently. Think of it like hitting him over the head with a verbal brick. Don't assume your hints or feelings are obvious. Leave no room for misinterpretation. Don't worry about coming off as whiny either, this is important to you.\n\nYou also have to consider what *he's* going through and the possibility that you've missed something. Maybe he's more stressed than he lets on and is afraid to fully express himself to you.\n\nAnd, if he really never changes or puts in effort to match yours no matter how clearly you've expressed yourself, then it might not be worth it for you. The ideal relationship is both partners putting in an equal amount of effort. Some people just aren't mature enough for a long term relationship, nor do they know how good they have it until it's gone.",

Is he open to those/has he been applying to places like that?

OP, this, right here, is terrible on her part. Reading the rest of your post, it's clear that she needs all attention and everything to be about HER. IMO this is not a healthy friendship that's loving or fair. Based on the quote above alone, she's manipulative and calculating - the fact that she commandeers every conversation and every group setting ... serious questions now that I believe you must ask yourself:\n\nYou may be a friend to her, but is she really a friend to YOU?  \nDoes she respect you?  \nWhy does she believe that what's happening in her life is more important than what's happening in yours (and is that really acceptable to you)?  \nWhy would she blatantly flirt with your Ex when she knew it would be pouring salt into a a painful wound for you?  \nI guess the material point is: Do you believe she treats you with nurturing support, kindness and respect as a friend should?\n\nIf you can answer these questions and still see her in a positive light, your resentment is probably about something else in your life. BUT reading your post makes me feel very upset on your behalf. She seems to be consistently self-absorbed, attention-seeking and dismissive of you as a person, as well as the others in your friend-group. IMO your resentment is warranted, and I'd rethink your friendship with this selfish waste of time/energy. I'm not sure your question about preventing her bad behavior makes sense to me, because she's established a trackable pattern over 5 years that confirms her lack of respect for you or your feelings. Why do you allow her to remain your friend or invite her to something she's almost surely going to ruin? But most importantly, think about the last sentence of your post - You can't and shouldn't have to control someone you care about. The fact that she creates this dilemma for you by even being present on your special day already gives you your answer. She's not a true friend if this is a constant worry, every single year and apparently every time you get together with her. Perhaps rethink maintaining this particular friendship/off-kilter-relationship?\n\nI wish you a beautiful birthday, and hope you can feel celebrated (as you deserve)!",

When your self-confidence is really low, you can start to feel like you deserve this treatment or like you will never be able to find somebody else.\n\nYou need to find a way to break through and know that you deserve way better than this. Maybe try and think back to before this relationship when you were feeling better about yourself, or think about what you would want a friend to do if they were in your position and then use that to help yourself stick with it. Stop second-guessing yourself. You know deep down that he's treating you appallingly and you need to be done with him.\n\nBreak up, block him on everything, and then stick with it. Talk to your loved ones about how he has treated you - sometimes saying the things out loud to loved ones can give you that feedback that helps you stick to ending things and can just help you feel less alone.",

Ask yourself, which one was happier? Also ask yourself, what part of him do you actually love so much, what qualities does he possess that he still deserves your love even after having such fatal flaws?\n\nWhat I see here is that maybe you need to convince your emotional side to just give up on him, convince yourself that he is not deserving of so much attention from you. Maybe find someone else interesting to talk to for yourself to truely realise that there is more fish in the sea? Or do something else that detaches you emotionally from your bf, that might help.",

Depends on whether or not the split was good or bad. If you ended on amicable terms because life got in the way, keeping an ex's things that they didn't ask to be given back is pretty common. But in the end, that's not her decision to make.\n\nFirst, I think you're going to have to accept that the clothes are probably gone already. If she threw away the slippers, I'm betting she tossed the clothes as soon as she removed them. I also wouldn't be surprised if she had taken other things belonging to your ex without you knowing.\n\nSecond, you need to have another conversation with her about returning the items. Be clear that it's not her choice to decide how you live your life and whether or not you keep stuff from an ex. That it is disrespectful to steal the items (literally - what started as borrowing is now stealing because she refuses to return a borrowed item). If she sticks to her position, then you may need to reconsider the entire friendship because it won't stop there.\n\nAnd if you do decide to cut contact with her over this, don't let her try to lay the blame on you with \"you'd really end a friendship over your ex's clothes?\". Remind her that she is the one that started all of this by stealing the items. And keep using the words \"steal\" and \"theft\".\n\nFinally, whatever you do, don't play \"whataboutism\". Doesn't matter if there are things in her life that you think she's doing wrong. You don't want to sink to her level and say something like \"And what if I took \\[blah\\]....\".

However it does seem like a major issue is the lack of communication here. Should he need to be told to come and support you in this difficult time? No, its almost certainly the most obvious and empathetic thing to do. Nonetheless, if you know that he can struggle on this front you have 2 options. \n\n1. Talk to him. You say this is the 3rd time you've felt hurt this way, but have you actually talked to him after any of these times? Let him know that you need support, he says that if you call him he'll come to you, so maybe that's just what you should do, or tell him that you want him to take initiative and put in the effort for these situations. If he still doesn't, at that point maybe ending the relationship is a good idea, if he can't put in the effort that's just unfair to you, but at the same time, it's clear nothing is going to change if you don't do anything.\n\nAlternatively 2. You can just end it. If his lack of empathy has been a reoccurring issue, despite bringing it to his attention, or if you simply don't think the relationship is worth the effort then this might be the best option\n\nKeep in mind that all relationships are effort, romantic or not. If you want this relationship to continue, then talk to him, and get him to put in some more effort, but if he doesn't want to put in the effort to change, or if you don't think that this relationship is worth the effort or hurt you'll get in trying to change him, then I would suggest ending it, because nobody is going to be happy in that relationship.\n\nIn the end it's crucial to talk to him about what you want, even if it may seem obvious to you, maybe not so much to him.\n\nTL;DR\n\nTalk to him, make sure he knows what you want, if he doesn't change, or if you truly feel this relationship won't bring you happiness no matter what, then it's probably not a relationship worth pursuing. It might seem obvious, but some people struggle to pick up on these cues, it doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't want to support you.",

I have adhd, I have struggled hard with fitting in as a child, making friends and relating to people, massive social anxiety, mistreatment from others etc. All these things pushed me away from wanting to be around other people and creating a social life, I became an introvert and love my drama free life, I truly never cared to learn better social skills. (I still have a few friends and a husband tho)\n\nWhen me and my husband got together we struggled with the same thing as well. We would get into some heated arguments and he thought I never truly cared about him because I never thought to dig into his life and ask the questions but I thought I was showing him I understand because I’ve been through something similar. It took a while for us to get in our groove.\n\nPoint is, you can’t expect her to change her style of communicating and relating to you after one conversation as it’s just her natural response. \n\n1. It’s okay to bring it up to her again, mention how that style of communicating makes you feel uncomfortable and ask for her to be more inquisitive for when it’s your turn to share. It’s okay to bring this up whenever you feel the need to.\n\n2. It’s important to be patient when someone is trying to learn how to love you better because theyre not only changing a part of themselves when they re-learn something but also because they think they are relating to you and showing understanding by mentioning something they learned or went through. We really think this is the best was to show that. Remind her, you don’t want to be related too, you want to express yourself and be shown love in the way you want to receive it. \n\n3. It’s going to take time, but imho, both conversation styles are really good to keep on hand. When you’re down about something and someone shares a story similar to yours, it shows they can understand your feelings and perspectives. I find it to be a deep understanding of how high and low emotions can be related to and respected. On the other hand, just talking about it and having an inquisitive dialogue with your partner is also important because it shows they care and are willing to listen to you, be supportive and give you quality time to get through it on your own terms.\n\nMeeting in the middle would be a great opportunity for you both, communication is super important and you should really work on this together. I hope you both can figure this out together.",

But I don't think you're giving nothing here. I think you probably like him on a friendly level. You're definitely checking all the loyal girlfriend checkboxes. But everything feels perfunctory. It's almost like you're playing a role rather than actually BEING in this.\n\nI think you like the attention he gives you. I think you generally like the idea of being loved by him. But he's just... not your person.\n\nHere's another issue you're running into... you're 19. And no, this isn't a knock about \"immaturity\" or other dumb shit. It's just a practical observation about how much people change in their late teens through their early 20s. What you need and want in a partner when you're 18 is not the case even a short time later. Priorities and wants and futures and goals change SO RAPIDLY in that 18-25 period. It's extremely hard for couples to stay together through all that and the ones that make it do so because they luckily change in the same ways during those transition periods. But even good matches often find themselves waking up next to a stranger like overnight.\n\nI think you know this isn't the relationship for you. Good luck with whatever's next.",

Finding love can take a long time and that doesn't mean there's anything wrong with you. It's part luck and part hard work. Do not change yourself to fit someone else's definition of an ideal partner; you'll end up unhappy and so will they. Nobody can people please forever.\n\nIf someone begins lovebombing (and I'm assuming you're using this term correctly) remind yourself of whether it's a reasonable time for someone to be deeply in love with you. If someone is professing love at a week-- well, they barely know you. It helps me to think-- \"do you do xx, say xx to every girl you've known a week? Gross. Not reasonable or reliable!\" Love may be a little slower and a little calmer, and you shouldn't dismiss suitors that move at that pace.\n\nYou are so young and have a lot to look forward to.

But unless you're writing this post as you escape from a successful art gallery heist, I think financial realities are going to mean having to put a pin in that for the moment unless you can somehow get it for near free.\n\nConsidering financial realities, I think your priority has to be putting space between you and your parents. You don't want to cut them out. That's... not amazing given the violence element, but I get your reluctance to just sever things completely. Just know that if the violence comes back or increases, you just need to leave.\n\nBut yeah... in general... your goal should be working towards independence. Figure out a plan to get you out of their house and out of their orbit of control. This isn't going to be immediate. This plan may take years to unfold. But make a plan. It sounds like you're already halfway there with your college plan. Focus HARD on that.\n\nBut also start looking into what it'll take for you to get your own place. Even if it's a little studio apartment. I think just not being around them all the time will do wonders for your mental health. It'll also help a lot with the resentment you're holding towards your sister. Again, you don't have to cut her off, but right now there's friction and friction comes from contact.\n\nSpeaking of which, you need to detach from these people in other ways. Take that dinner anecdote. Yeah, your sister was a brat and your parents were useless. But that entire argument could have been avoided if you hadn't bothered to invite your sister to join you on your babysitting endeavor in the first place. You say she's a spoiled brat... so why are you offering her part of your job? Why are you enmeshing this problematic person FURTHER into your life in unnecessary ways? Why are you discussing the particulars of this job around your parents who, of course, will take her side no matter how dumb it is?\n\nPut your parents on an information diet. Stop further enmeshing yourself in your sister's life. Start learning how to keep things borderline superficial with all of these people.\n\nAs for not passing this down to your own children... that'll come with therapy. But also it'll come with recognizing your own flaws and the flaws of your other family members and also finding your own independence. I think if you're given more space to focus on yourself rather than how you fit into this fucked up dynamic, you'll gain confidence to forge your own path, and that includes in how to raise your own children in the future.\n\nGood luck.",

Opposite of your situation, I am naturally more of a slob and he is more cleaner than me, but even with that dynamic, I was expected to do like 90% of the cleaning. I just took the abuse for the first few years of our relationship because I wasn’t working, but then I graduated and started working 2 jobs and commuting 2-3 hours a day. I would literally be gone 14 hours a day and come home and clean/cook. We also moved into a house that we both owned. He worked from home for 8 hours a day. He would just absolutely rage over the littlest things, like leaving a cup of water on the coffee table or a single dish in the sink. He critiqued my cooking. When we started seeing a therapist about this and the therapist called him out on how ridiculous he was being, he then tried to say I didn’t play/exercise our dog enough. Dude, the sun hadn’t come up yet when I left the house and it would be down when I came home, and I had chores to do, I did not have time to play with the dog. I offered to start taking the dog to daycare and he called me lazy… said I would be a horrible mother and didn’t want to have children with me. That was one of the final straws for me. Therapist took my side when I said I wanted a divorce. Please don’t let him treat you like this. It will only get worse. Even if you meet all his demands he will have more because he is controlling. Just get out before he breaks your heart and confidence even more.",

Maybe she does better in structured activities where there’s a clear endpoint, like mini golf or a ballgame or a movie.

It’s okay for there to be some things that she sits out and are just for you, especially if they’re going to be things that will create a negative experience for you _(and her and everyone else)_. \n\nAlso pay attention to how your family is behaving during these things.

I feel that she sees you as her primary caregiver and as long as you are willing to provide basic accommodation, I can't see her changing the scenario. Do you have a grasp on her condition and her prognosis for recovering and functioning?  You need to know this  (and not directly from her alone). And is she getting effective therapy? Because it sounds like she isn't. Worst case scenario is that she'll let herself get pregnant. You do not have to start your life like this. Why not try having her move out and, hopefully, that's back to parents. It can't get any worse than it is now and you will get a better perspective in your situation. You're not expected to take on responsibility like this. ",

Maybe you grumble a bit, but hey, listening to grumbling now and then is way easier than getting a job! Plus you'll get over it.\n\nA relationship needs to be additive to your life, at a minimum. If you wouldn't tolerate this behavior from your best guy friend, you should not tolerate it from your best lady friend. It doesn't matter how good the sex is. If the only thing she's bringing to the relationship is sex, you've got a prostitute living with you.\n\n\nMiss me with this \"I don't wanna go to my job\" horseshit. No one really wants to go to work, some people are just huge children about owning their responsibilities. Unfortunately sometimes we think that being patient and understanding is helpful, it is not, you're just helping her dodge her obligations in life. You should be taking note and remembering everything she's doing here. You will see this pattern again, repeatedly, I promise you.",

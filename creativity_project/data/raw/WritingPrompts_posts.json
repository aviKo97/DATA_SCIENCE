      "title": "[OT] Thank you R/WritingPrompts, I rediscovered my love for writing because of you guys.",
      "content": "First, a bit of context. I'm 35 years old this coming September. I have an OK job, and an alright life. And, ever since I picked writing back up, I am happier now than I have ever been.\n\nDuring the tail end of last year, I was having what could charitably be called, 'One of Those Days'. Life was sucking just a little bit more than usual. I remember calling one of my friends just to vent, and they asked me something that really hit. I remember the exact line:\n\n\"What would you rather be doing then? Even if it meant having a slightly shittier life, what would you rather do instead?\"\n\nFor some reason, I flashed back to my university years, scribbling fanfics on the back of cheap diaries, because I liked their smell, and the way the paper felt against my hand. The smell of gel pen ink and cooling cocoa. Sweaty laundry begging for attention, and the sound of some anime classic playing in the background on my laptop.\n\nI'd write for hours back then. Nothing good really, but that was never the point. Nobody read them but me. And that was enough.\n\nSomewhere along the way, I stopped.\n\nI never graduated (that's a whole other thing), but I figured something out for myself. For a while there, things were terrible, but slowly I figured out the whole 'being an adult' thing, and finally got myself to a place where I wasn't embarrassed to be around myself.\n\nI built a small business, tried my hand at relationships, and generally stumbled my way through life just like everyone else. But I had stopped writing, and I think - somewhere deep inside - I lost some of life's color along the way.\n\nThen my friend said what she said, and I remembered. Everything. Just like that.\n\nI found some of my old diaries and scribbles and spent a whole afternoon simultaneous cringing and laughing at myself. I fired up my laptop and - remembering how I used to trawl through this sub back in the day - logged back on and read through some stories.\n\nAnd then I came across this prompt: [https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gra8lf/pi\\_are\\_we\\_dating\\_weve\\_been\\_married\\_for\\_four\\_years/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1gra8lf/pi_are_we_dating_weve_been_married_for_four_years/)\n\nImmediately, I imagined a scene based on a pair of characters who'd been living rent free in the back of my head for years. In two hours, I had the story down, but I was nervous, so I never posted it. Then, days later, after yet another tiny edit, I remember thinking to myself \"Fuck it\" and posting it as a PI. I didn't check on it for a full day.\n\nWhen I finally bullied myself into getting over my nerves, I checked on the post  and (I'm not kidding) cried a little bit when I saw all of 80 upvotes on the piece, and some kind words to boot beneath it.\n\nIt might not be much compared to some of the true titans over on this sub, but to lil ol' me, it felt like coming home. Finally, someone had read something I had written, and they hadn't hated it. I had written something I liked, and the world (all 80 upvotes of it) had liked it too. I had written something.\n\nI had written something.\n\nEver since then, something changed. I wrote a few more things on here, but mostly on prompts that I felt allowed me to play around with the characters and world that I'd had brewing in my head for years. I posted prompts. Not sure what happened to Image Prompts. Back in the day they used to be all the rage, with the sidebar Image Prompt being a particularly sought after prize. I saw a gap, and so that's where I staked my flag, posting at least 4 image prompts a week.\n\nBut mostly, I got to work writing MY story.\n\nIt's been slow work. Typing doesn't come as naturally to me as some. I've also had to learn that the love of a craft does not a master make. My style is still a work in progress. But honestly? I am having the time of my life, and would not have it any other way. I am happy.\n\nAnd so I pay it forward. I post prompts on here, and do my best to reply when someone responds. I remember what it felt like for me, and so I want to pass on a little bit of that magic.\n\nAnd, whenever I can steal away some time for myself, I plug away at what I eventually hope will be a web serial I can one day be proud of.\n\nSo thank you r/WritingPrompts. You gave me back something I thought I had lost a long time ago.\n\nParticular thanks to:  \nu/major_breakdown = For lighting a competitive fire within me every time I read one of their prompt replies.  \nu/Zetakh = For the prompt that sent me down the deepest rabbit hole of my life  \nu/Nahsungminy = For the  kind word that gave me the confidence to get off my ass.  \nu/MajorParadox = For the SatChats that reminded me that the community on here is always looking to sharpen their pencils and gitgud.\n\nu/nobodysgeese = For the Free Write Tuesdays, and the timeless advice. Know that every moment you spent helping us fledglings with a well written critique here and there was the fire that kept some of us going. I salute you.\n\nThank you all!",

Each time she let go with one hand she feared she would fall at Mach 1, but with each hit the metal door bended until she finally took it off of its hinges and force it inside the plane. With a last struggle she managed to get inside too.\n\nAs she managed to get inside the air vessel she was received by a punch to the face. The Queen of Clubs stumbled back and almost fell of the aircraft but managed to force herself inside all the same. Inside the vessel there was a man not dressed in any of the uniforms of the Deck: Not the Diamonds, not the Hearts, not the Spades nor the Clubs. Wasn't this supposed to be an unmanned vessel?\n\nHe made a nod with his head as he took a strange gun of his belt and pointed it at her.\n\n\"Sorry in advance for this miss Doe.\"\n\nAs the stranger shoot a green laser from his weapon, the Queen of Clubs managed to avoid it, take the gun of his hands and crush it, all while taking him by the chest and hitting him against the plane's wall.\n\n\"I don't know who you are, but in case you haven't noticed this whole thing is a bomb and it's going to…!\" the Queen of Clubs paused for a second just realising what the stranger had just said. \"Wait, what did you call me?\"\n\n**Fifteen minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe man struggled to get free, but the armoured woman strength was too much for him. Seeing no better option now that he failed to take his objective down by surprise he decided to go for the diplomatic route.\n\n\"I know who you are, Jean Doe, alias the Queen of Clubs, formerly Clover Trèfle, also alias the Queen of Clubs, former member of the quadrumvirate of Deck. This is going to seem strange but I just want to help.\"\n\n\"Well, you sure have a strange way of helping.\" The armoured woman moved over her sight towards the plane's controls. \"You can explain whatever this is about later, I have to stop this plane.\"\n\n\"Here is the thing, miss Doe. I can't let you do that.\" The stranger took advantage of the distraction to press a button on his belt, creating an electrical discharge that electrocuted the Queen of Clubs. The heroine screamed in pain and was forced to let go, moment in that he tried to push her our of the plane, but again she reacted in time and cached his fist before punching him in the jaw, making sure to contain herself enough to not take his head off.\n\n**Fourteen minutes until detonation.**\n\n\"What the hell is wrong you!?\"\n\nThe man spitted blood, several of his teeth broken by the powerful punch. \"I suppose the chances of this going my way increase if I tell you. You can't avoid this disaster Jean Doe, if you do the future is doomed.\"\n\nThe Queen of Clubs closed her fist harder forcing the man to scream and to get on his knees. \"What are you ranting about? Are you insane?\"\n\n\"Please! Agh! You need to listen!\" The man tried in vain to get free, but the superhuman strength of the armoured woman was too much for him. \"This plane needs to explode on target!\"\n\n\"All I'm hearing is that Deck is clearly working with some kind of psycho that for some reason knows my secret identity.\" The armoured heroine looked back at the controls, trough the window she was already starting to see the silhouette of the city. She was getting out of time. \"And that right now I can't afford to lose time with you.\"\n\nIn a panic the man realised if he wanted any chance of all his efforts succeeding he couldn't keep his secret anymore. \"No please! I'm from the future! I know what's going to happen if you stop this plane! You will doom us all!\"\n\n**Thirteen minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe Queen of Clubs looked at the desperate man. Was he really from the future? That was impossible… Um… Implausible… Em… Unlikely. She looked at him doubting, mentally calculating how much time she could afford to lose before the explosive plane was already on the city. \"What are you talking about?\"\n\nThe man of the future grunted in pain. \"This plane is going to crash into the Global Humanitarian Science Complex! It will kill thousands, including some of the brightest minds of the planet!\"\n\n\"More of a reason to stop it now that I can.\"\n\n\"No! Please understand!\" The future man looked at the heroine with crying eyes. \"This will be a tragedy, but a necessary one! In precisely twenty minutes and twenty seconds, one Doctor Ivo Animo will activate his… I can't remember the name right now but a ray that will convert all the city into giant monsters! They will ravage the world! The only way to stop them is with this plane killing him before he can activate it!\"\n\n**Twelve minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe Queen of Clubs looked at the desperate man with an astonished face. \"That's… Ridiculous. Do you really expect me to believe that?\"\n\n\"Of course not! It's completely absurd! Who in their sane mind would believe that!?\" The man cried in frustration, finally managing to get his hand free of the heroine's grab. \"This is why I tried to take you out of the plane! To stop this without needing you to believe me!\"\n\nJean was feeling her sweat under her helmet. They were almost over the city.\n\n\"But why do this?\"\n\n\"Hell if I know!\" The future man tried to recover his mobility on his wounded hand. \"We think he was bitter for not being nominated for a Nobel Price and decided to probe the world how great he was by…\"\n\n\"Not that!\" The Queen of Clubs grunted frustrated as she saw the city getting closer and closer. \"Why stop it like this? If you can go back in time why not stop him before? Why let thousands of people die?\"\n\n\"Do you think this was our first idea!?\"\n\n**Eleven minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe man of the future started going angrily back and forth the plane. \"This is literally as far back in time as it was possible for us to travel! Twenty five minutes before the disaster! We know that Dr Animo is in the Complex but we don't know where, and with twenty five minutes and only enough energy for a single trip we couldn't afford sending someone there and fail because we couldn't find him! But then we found out about this, the bomb plane of Deck that you stopped minutes before calamity that by sheer coincidence was going directly at the Complex. With this we can ensure Dr Animo is stopped.\"\n\nThe Queen of Clubs stayed in silence for a few precious seconds. Trying to make a decision. All she needed to do to save the world was do… nothing? Let the plane explode? But it would cost thousands of lives, thousands of lives she would known she could had saved, thousands that would die due to her inaction.\n\n**Ten minutes until detonation.**\n\nJean sighted as she looked back at the man of the future. \"He will activate his ray in how many minutes? Twenty?\"\n\n\"Seventeen minutes and thirteen seconds.\" Said the man after looking at his chronometer.\n\n\"So… What I am hearing…\" The Queen of Clubs got to the controls of the plane. \"Is that I have seventeen minutes to stop this plane, get to the Global Humanitarian Science Complex, find Animo and stop him.\"\n\nThe man looked at the armoured woman with awe. He had heard stories but until now he believed them to be exaggerations. After hearing all that, she was still willing to do whatever she could to save as many people as possible.\n\n**Nine minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe Queen of Clubs approached the controls. \"I can't crash this thing into the ocean, we are too close to the city and even if we could it would leave us too far from the Science Complex. I'll try to direct this thing to go over it before exploding in the air, then we can jump and look for him…\"\n\nThe man of the future sighted. \"They warned me about this, you know? That if I told Jean Doe the situation she would do her best to save everyone without any casualty.\"\n\nSuddenly Jean felt a terrible headache as the man electrocuted her again with a syringe looking device directly on her helmet. The Queen of Clubs fell on her knees screaming while her head was feeling as it was going to burst.\n\n\"WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME!?\"\n\n**Eight minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe man looked sadly at the heroine struggling in agony. \"When Clover Trèfle was wounded and fell into the ocean she lost her memories and the League gave her the new identity of Jean Doe. She lived as a normal woman with no recollection of her past until she learned she used to be the Queen of Clubs, but instead of going back to her criminal past she decided to become a superhero to emend her wrongs.\" Jean started bashing her head on the ground, desperate for the horrible pain to stop. \"She never got her memories back. It was impossible with the technology and medicine of the past. By all means and purpose, Clover Trèfle died, and Jean Doe took her place.\"\n\nThe Queen of Clubs cried on the ground, agonizing at the immense pain. The man of the future continued:\n\n\"Jean Doe couldn't stop herself of saving other people, even if that supposed a risk to the entire world she would do her best to save everyone. So… I am sorry, but if Jean Doe can't let thousands die to save billions… Clover Trèfle will have to come back.\"\n\n**Seven minutes until detonation.**\n\nJean started to receive memories at terrible speed, her nose bleeding out of the effort, memories she had long since forgotten: Her parents showing her the importance of pride and arrogance, others adoring her, being praised for her strength, being taught she deserved everything, her leading the Club branch of Deck, her fights against the meddling heroes, how she manipulated and was manipulated in turn by the leaders of the other branches… All things she knew had done but that for the first time they made actual sense in her head.\n\nShe finally stopped screaming, breathing heavily as she remained on the floor. The man put his hand on her shoulder.\n\n\"Clover?\"\n\nThe Queen of Clubs scuffed, doing her best to get back on her feet. \"That is Lady Trèfle to you. No, you shall direct to me as my title: her Majesty, the Queen of Clubs.\"\n\n**Six minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe man looked at the armoured woman sadly. He felt bad turning a prominent heroine back into a villainess, but he didn't actually had a choice.\n\n\"Her Majesty, this plane is about to crash. We should abandon it while we still have the cha…\"\n\n\"Close your mouth, worm!\" The Queen of Clubs kicked the man on the leg and the bone snapped and broke by the strength. The man feel to the ground screaming.\n\n\"Yes, I am Clover Trèfle, so what?\" The Queen of Clubs now moved different than before, with more pride and a royal stance. \"Do you presume that just because I have my memories back I will suddenly forget who I am? I am her Majesty, the Queen of Clubs, the greatest woman who shall accomplish anything and all she desires, and right now I shall stop this plane and save the world, for I am the greatest heroine of all time!\"\n\n**Five minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe Queen of Clubs got over the man of the future who screamed in fear and confusion: \"What are you doing!? You are not supposed to…!\"\n\n\"Do not presume you know me, fool!\" The armoured woman took the chronometer out of the time traveller’s wrist. She had twelve minutes left, a bit short for comfort, but she thought it was doable. \"I shall not be manipulated by the likes of you. I have already decided I will save everyone and this is what I shall do.\"\n\n\"You can't!\" The man tried to get up, but his legs was completely broken. She wasn't holding back her strength anymore. \"There is no time! The only possible solution is letting this plane explode!\"\n\n\"Impossible for a coward like you, who only knows to attack by surprise or beg, perhaps.\" The Queen of Clubs got at the controls of the plane, where Jean would have had to figure out how to make it work, Clover put the manual controls with the press of a button. \"Now shut your mouth. I am saving the world right now.\"\n\n**Four minutes until detonation.**\n\nThe Global Humanitarian Science Complex was already on sight, the Queen of Clubs started to change the plane's trajectory so that it would go over it, she didn't have a way to reduce the impact of the shrapnel produced by the explosion other than hoping that it would fall on the ceiling and that it wouldn't fall over anyone. This was not a good solution and she was aware of it, but she had no time to think of a better one.\n\nAs she started to make the plane rise, the future man growled in pain on the floor. He couldn't let this happen again, people had sacrificed too much to give him a chance, he couldn't let this happen again.\n\n**Three minutes until detonation.**\n\n\"You won't…\" The time traveller managed to get himself up in his remaining leg and managed to put his arms around the Queen of Clubs' neck. \"You won't ruin this! It's too late to time travel again! I will not let you ruin this!\"\n\n\"Let go of me, you buffoon!\" The heroine tried to keep control of the plane, but it was hard to control with the door opened and while being shaken around by the man, she almost used her strength to take him off her, but while the old Clover would had done so without a second thought the part of her that was once Jean knew that doing so would mean ripping his arms off. \"I'm trying very hard to not give you brain damage by punching you unconscious!\"\n\nThe plane started going down, risking crashing before even reaching the Science Complex.\n\n**Two minutes until detonation.**\n\n\"I will… Save everyone!\" Once again, the time traveller went to use his belt to electrocute the Queen of Clubs, but by taking one of his arms from her, she managed to spin around and hit him on the ribs.\n\nThe man was thrown like a ragdoll against the opposite wall of the plane, landing with such strength that the metal wall dented. He started coughing and trying to breath, all of his right ribs broken and his head bleeding from the impact.\n\nWith no time to feel guilty about that, the Queen of Clubs managed to stabilize the plane and make it point up, gaining altitude again.\n\n**One minute until detonation.**\n\nWith the plane gaining altitude and already over the Science Complex, the Queen of Clubs got up from the controls and got over the time traveller.\n\nHe was still coughing, feeling dizzy and with an enormous pain on his chest and leg. Still, he managed to look up at the armoured woman. \"Congratulations, miss Trèfle… You went ahead and fucked all of us over…\" He coughed, struggling to breathe. \"All the efforts of those that put their hopes in me have been wasted.\"\n\n\"It's her Highness, the Queen of Clubs for you.\" Without hesitation, the heroine took the time traveller on her arms. \"Now shut up and take it easy. You have done your part, now their hope is on my shoulders.\"\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nFrom the window on the Global Humanitarian Science Complex, doctor Ivo Animo looked at a huge explosion on the air. Any other day he would have had gone outside to see what was going on, but this was not like any other day.\n\nThe old man finished assembling the last parts of his machine. His most grandiose and final creation. He took a moment to contemplate it: The shiny new metal, the pure black cables that would normally lose its purity after a few weeks working, the little but elegant screen showing the level of charge. He knew there was no point in making it look pleasant, but it was his magnum opus and he refused to make it look anything less than perfect.\n\nHe sighted, feeling tired from the effort of assembling it. He took a moment to catch his breath, his years weighting heavily over his frail body, and connected the machine to the power grid.\n\nHe needed to build it on the Science Complex, only there was enough energy to actually power it enough. Had he had more time he would had built a way for the machine to power on its own, but he knew that in just a few more weeks he would had been forced to retire, so he had no time to design or create a power system.\n\nAs the little light bulbs started illuminating one after another, charging his genetic ray, Doctor Animo took a moment to fantasize about what would had he designed to power the machine had he had the time. He felt confident in that with enough time he might had been able to create a compact nuclear generator, merely the size of the room. But alas, time was running out.\n\nSuddenly the lights flickered and some of the lightbulbs went out, the old doctor looked at the screen and saw how the charge slowed down. What was that? Maybe the machine used too much energy too fast and provoked an electrical cut? No matter, there was still the emergency generators, there was more than enough energy in them to fully charge his last invention.\n\nAs the minutes passed and the machine slowly charged the doctor closed his eyes, resting a little while awaiting his moment of triumph. Soon the whole world would see first had the magnitude of his genius, and he would assume in death the recognition that always was denied to him during his life.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, the lights went out.\n\nThere was an uproar outside of the room, and the frustrated doctor went out to see what was happening. A lot of colleagues and other workers of the centre were getting out to see what had happened, he could hear the security guards scream and run. He tried to ask what was happening but nobody knew.\n\nAs he went out, hoping the power would return soon to finally complete his swan song he saw several security officers and some members of the police around the building where the emergency generators where stored, or rather, where they usually where stored.\n\nInstead, the whole building had been turned into rubble, and an armoured woman was standing with a grandiose laugh while the officers pointed their weapons at her.\n\n \n\nThe Queen of Clubs laughed satisfied as the whole building went dark after she had destroyed both the power grid and the emergency generators. She didn't had any way to guarantee to find the doctor in time, but by leaving the whole building without power nothing could be powered.\n\nShe looked around at the security guards that had come when hearing and seeing her destruction and smiled at them under the helmet. \"Would you be a darling and tell me where I can find Doctor Ivo Animo?\"",

      "content": "[Original prompt!](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1kzbnnm/wp_my_mom_ran_a_hotel_for_ghostly_visitors_they/)\n\n# Ghostly Memories\n\n\"What? Your mom runs a hotel for ghosts?! I need to see that!\"—that's how this all started, back at Winihair college, at the courtyard during the afternoon break. We were sitting under the *eiboi* tree in the northern courtyard, other kids were running around, but I never liked running—neither did Tony. We'd been friends since the start of the semester. He was new in town, and I'd noticed he was just as quiet as myself, so we started talking. I had never told anyone about my mom's work, but I had hoped he would understand—and I was glad when he got excited instead of horrified.\n\n\"—Now, Tonayen, I beg you, please, calm down. It was never my intention to do what I did, but it cost my life—there's nothing else I can pay with,\" said the translucent figure while Tony cried hard, hands on his face, his back shuddering with each sob. We were sitting in a private dining room to the left of the main hall of my mom's hotel, the Feather Palace. I sat beside him, not really knowing what to do, while my mom stood beside him with a hand on his back, trying to offer him some *eiboi* juice to calm him down. The ghost hovered over an oval wooden table in the middle of the room—from the chest up, he rose above it, his waist passing through the table as if it wasn't even there. A long sword pierced his chest from right to left. They always carried with them the instrument of their death—some were comedic, others tragic.\n\n\"Goshin, will you leave us alone, please?\" said my mother with her calming voice. Her blond hair was pinned in a bun on top of her head, streaked with more and more white by then. She always knew how to handle any situation—even the improbable ones.\n\n\"But I need him to forgive me, Mrs. Raine, it's the only way I can be free, and—\" he started, but she cut him off.\n\n\"This is not the time, Goshin, look what you've done to the poor kid. Leave us, now,\" she commanded.\n\nThe ghost left the room, passing right behind me and out through the wall. She pulled out a chair and sat in front of him, then turned to me and asked, \"Will you leave us alone for a moment?\"\n\nI thought about protesting—he was my friend! But really I didn't know what I could possibly do to help him. And I was sure she knew. So I did as she asked, opening and closing the door at the far left end of the wall behind me.\n\nThe hall was full of ghosts. Whenever there was a war, business boomed in the hotel, and word was that a furious battle had just broken between one house or another down in the south. There were various chairs and tables in the hall, but few used them—most floated, talking in little groups. Those who did sit, I had noticed, were most often than not newly dead, which you could tell by the vibrancy of their bluish hue, and the gloom expression on their faces.\n\n\"Jano, kid, over here,\" said a voice to my right. It took me a moment to spot him near the front door, sitting—or as best as he could; there was a palm's width of air between his bottom and the chair—with a book open in front of him. I walked up to him.\n\n\"At your service, Mr. Darius,\" I said, using the greeting my mom had taught me.\n\n\"Could you turn the page for me, please?\" he asked. I did so while he kept talking.\n\n\"The hero just fell off the cliff—I need to know if he lives or dies!\"\n\nI knew the ending, I had already read the *The Adventures of the Hawkrider*, and it baffled me that he couldn't figure it out from the title. But I didn't want to spoil it for him, so I just said \"Have fun finding out!\"\n\nHe thanked me as I walked away.\n\nAs I crossed the hall, I was nearly hit by a flying ball—or so I thought, only realizing it was translucent after it passed me by. Three ghosts came running in the air after it. I wondered if they really needed to move their legs or if it was just habit. One of them had an arrow sticking out of his left eye. Another had a gruesome wound running diagonally from his throat down to his chest. And the last one, trailing behind the other two, had no head at all—which made me realize the ball was actually Mr. Tomon's head. The poor man, he was already very faint, and his blue had faded so much it was almost white. I just left them to their play—I couldn't really catch his head for him, and wanted to talk to Mr. Goshin, who was floating near the back of the hall.\n\nI reached him, floating a head above me. His eyes were closed, and he didn't open them the first time I called out, so I tried again.\n\n\"Excuse me! Mr. Goshin, down here!\" I said. \n\nI thought about touching his leg, but Mom had said it was very offensive to do that to a patron. Thankfully he heard me before I did, and, opening his eyes, he floated down.\n\n\"Ahm—excuse me, Mr. Goshin,\" I began, unsure how to ask, \"but what was all that about? You… killing Tony's mother?!\"\n\nI sounded more angry than I meant to, but there was really no nicer way to say it—or at least I couldn't think of one.\n\nHe didn't seem to take offense.\n\n\"It was an accident, young Raine. You're Tonayen's friend, right? Will you please talk to him? This state I'm living in is a nightmare, I'm just as tormented as he is, I swear. Will you please talk to him?\"\n\nI couldn't ask that of Tony—not without learning more about the story first.\n\n\"What kind of accident? What did you do?\" I asked.\n\nHe didn't look like he wanted to answer, but after a moment, he did.\n\n\"It was an accident. We were climbing over the wall of the royal forest to hunt—like we had done so many times before. But they caught us, and were chasing us down as we tried to climb out in a hurry. I—\"\n\nHe started to sob every other word.\n\n\"I—I checked her climbing r—rope, I swear I—di—did it. But she fell. My sister f—fell. Oh Father of the Forest, I… l—let her… h—her f—f—fall, and—\"\n\nI couldn't understand any more of what he tried to say. Oh poor Tony. I felt for him. And even for Mr. Goshin.\n\n\"But how did you die?\" I asked him.\n\nIt was a very rude question, my mother had told me, but I had to know—and thankfully, he answered, sobbing a little less this time.\n\n\"I brought her home. I—I carried her in my arms. When her husband saw me, he—he was in a fury, and I had no—no strength to f—fight. I didn't de—deserve to live anymore,\" he finished.\n\nThere was a long silence then, and I didn't really know what to say. Should I thank him for sharing his story?\n\nThankfully he continued, in a low, solemn voice.\n\n\"The last thing I saw was the look in Tonayen's eyes. I couldn't bear that look—it killed me as much as his father's sword.\"\n\nHis last words were almost a whisper.\n\nThere was silence between us again. Should I talk to Tony? If he forgave him, Mr. Goshin would be free to transcend—while Tony would have to live the rest of his days with that memory. Was that fair?\n\nI didn't know if I could live with a memory like that inside my head. I couldn't help but imagine mother lying cold on someone's arms. I shuddered.\n\n\"I'm so sorry for your loss, Mr. Goshin,\" I told him. \"I'll talk to Tony,\" I lied.\n\nI knew it was a decision he had to make on his own. Well, my mother was talking to him already. If he decided to forgive him, that was fine—and if not, that was fine too. I walked back behind the counter, waiting for them to leave the private room, which they did shortly after.\n\nTony had stopped crying, but his eyes were still red and swollen. \"Jano, will you walk him back home?\" she asked me. Promptly I jumped off the stool and walked with him out of the hall. He walked with his head down, not looking around. I looked back at Mr. Goshin as we left, and saw him wailing silently in the corner.\n\nThe sky was just starting to darken as we walked silently down the street toward his house near the docks. I didn't expect him to be the first to break the silence.\n\n\"Thanks for showing me around, Jano. Your mother seems really nice—you're lucky,\" he said.\n\n\"You're always welcome,\" I replied. \"Well, maybe you won't want to come back to my place, but we can hang out at yours later, if you want,\" I fumbled, trying to avoid awkwardness—and failing.\n\n\"Yeah, you can come to my place later.\" There was a silence, which he broke, \"Hey, I didn't believe you when you told me, but at least I know that son of a pig is getting what he deserves. He'll live forever knowing what he did, while I go on to meet Mom later. I just have to be patient.\"\n\nSo that's his decision. It's fine.\n\n\"Hey, did you see Mr. Tomon's head?\" I asked.\n\n\"Ha! I sure did. It rolled right through Mrs. Raine!\"\n\nWe laughed together down the street.",

      "content": "Even the animals tensed up, wondering what all those people are so eagerly looking for - wondering just what could be so interesting in the sky that the whole world stopped to lay its eyes on it. \n  \nStanding at the rally, I was looking right up at the sky with a hopeful fighting spirit. I don't think I've ever been around this many people gathered in one place, let alone in such a cheerful atmosphere.\n  \nPeople were cheering, screaming and bumping into each other, and the air was thick and warm, not a single cloud in the sky. The milder ones were unsuccessfully trying to avoid the crowd pushing them, yet still stared above. \n   \nThe children didn't know what was happening but even between the toddlers there was an understanding that something big was happening. Some were screaming, cheering, some observing their parent's reaction rather than the sky, some afraid. Only the babies remained unaffected. They still cried, they were still hungry, they still didn't understand any more or any less.\n   \nThe president waved as he got up on the podium in the Central. Everyone over the world was watching on rallies with those giant TVs or otherwise projected video. He was perhaps one of the only people who were not outside at the moment. \n  \n\"Thank you, thank you all for coming here today... you know, what you and me, what we witness here today is... \n  \nit's change, our greatest weapon, we built this weapon, we did everything we can as we will continue to do, and the damage will be so great, we go against Vorldan once again and it will be so unexpected they will not even have a chance... We here already celebrate because we have this weapon, the outcome doesn't even matter. Look at the beauty that we all made possible, its really amazing... \n  \nAnd, you know, I actually talked to Vorldan's president, horrible man, he's, he's fat and senile always rambling about something, he doesn't even know what... I said Abill, I call him Abill, I said Abill, what you're doing here with all these terrorist attacks is going to end here or I will make it end and he said, said with so much disrespect he talked to me, he said it's for a greater good he must, like one of those cultists. He just couldn't say 'you're right, mister president, this has to end' because he, he just doesn't know anything anymore and I will save all those innocent people from that monster. I'm going to do what everyone else failed before me, I'm gonna protect this world. Nikdy!\"\n   \n\"Konec!\" the crowd roared back like Pavlov's dogs salivate at the ring of a bell. Through the entire speech the cheers were so loud I could hardly hear what the president said, but I knew it was grand. I knew he would lead us away from this dark time and I yelled, I yelled and cheered with such a deep anger at Vorldan and the tragedies they cause. I waved my flag with a tense fist. Hell is not underground, it's a world away. \n   \nBut in the end it didn't even matter what the president said. Even those who heard him speaking didn't hear what he was saying. Whether they love or hate him, no one knows what he thinks if anything. They know the meaning of the words he spoke, they knew when to cheer and when to cry. They knew when to jump and how high. \n   \nThe president introduced another politician. I didn't even want to listen to what he was saying. I was angry but exhausted and I just wanted to feel relief. I caught some words he said, but no meaning I could make out. Finally, everyone started clapping with an aggressively enthusiastic roar. It was happening. \n   \n The rockets were in motion; hundreds of thousands of enormous silver ships bigger than towers launched towards the sky from all over the world. They had been worked on for years and finally the work went to something. They were wearing a red and yellow flag which would begin burning as soon as they would reach the atmosphere because of the incredible speed. Their speed would have devastated our whole world wide. Their gunpower and bombs would have turned us into ash. The great krayiskas heading toward a single target. Vorldan. \n  \nIt was amazing. It felt like the impossible had become possible. It felt like hope and victory and the sweet taste of freedom. The people cheered, the people clapped, the people yelled, the people were overcome with fear they mistook for obsessive admiration. The children stared in awe, ran alongside the rockets and yelled. The babies cried. \n   \nMore speeches and events were going on, but after 30 minutes the cops pushed the crowd to spread out. I didn't wanna get hurt, so I left on my own to a nearby hill. I watched the rockets until they were no longer visible from here. When they disappeared, even though I was alone, I could hear the screeches and cheers coming from just about everywhere. \n  \nWhen it was no longer visible, I was looking at the sky still. It's been a while since I did that... Look at the sky for no reason other than to see the sky. \n   \n...\n   \nI thought for a while about the past. I thought for a while about my past. It made my head hurt. My thoughts jumped from the clouds back to my head and ran away from there back to clouds. \n  \nToday my past changed. All of it became for something. It got a greater goal. But my past is still the same. And tomorrow, I'll go back to making more weapons.\n  \nDeep inside I may wonder, if anything did really change. I dont... I dont even know what I would change. Where would one even begin? What would happen if the war stopped? If we won? How would we win? Would anything change for me except grocery prices? The world would be a better place, wouldn't it? Our world...\n  \n... I thought and thought, until the sky was absorbed by darkness. And maybe it was enough for me to think that somewhere, those rockets were there, making my future life better, changing everything. But then the first star came out. And then more. And soon the sky was covered in more stars than Kepler could count. And I realized I don't even know where the rockets were flying. I don't even know ...\n  \n   \n \nI got up to go home, my head turned down. \n   \n \nBecause I remembered why I never look at the sky.\n \n--\n \nOG Prompt: https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/s/xTdIsNK5QK",

Thanks u/Zetakh!  \nSetting: Biopunk  \nContent: Violence, Language, Visceral Damage  \n\n\nRandy shifted his gears up just as the bass shuddered in. Lassie leapt underneath him, its feeders coaxing more speed out of her core.\n\nRandy grinned. It wasn't often that one of these runs offered up the sort of challenge that got his blood pumping. Or that he managed to snag mixtapes this good before he set out.\n\n\"You like that girl?\", he asked, pushing aside a small pile of cans to the floor as he rooted around his passenger seat.\n\nHe liked to imagine that the slight shifts in the core's cadence constituted some sort of reply.\n\nHis fingers closed around the strips of jerky he'd left over from last night with a triumphant flourish, just as Lassie chewed into a hairpin corner. It had taken three nights and all of the Buzzard's best Carvers to tune his Mantis up to the specifications he'd demanded. And - credit where credit was due - the boss hadn't flinched when Randy gave her his shopping list.\n\nThe results spoke for themselves.\n\nPumping his pedals, he punctuated his thoughts with a particularly intricate series of twists and turns as he navigated the thick vines and roots that crawled across the ancient highway.\n\nThe Interior didn't like putting routes like these on any map. It didn't even come as a surprise when, every few hours, Randy found himself activating Lassie's camo-grafts to evade the Ministry's roving patrols. Overgrown and strain-blighted, nothing on wheels stood a spit-stained prayer's chance of making their way along a relic road's tangled stretches.\n\nBut Lassie wasn't running on wheels.\n\nRandy let out an impassioned whoop at the colossal splash Lassie created as she careened of a broken bridge into the churning river below. A quick glance at his new add-ons confirmed that the door's seals were holding against the current.\n\n\"And they say money can't buy you happiness,\" he remarked appreciatively, shifting gears.\n\nRandy coaxed his way to the river's opposite bank, the Mantis' centipedal grafts churning beneath her mass. Climbing out onto embankment, he activated his Mantis' replenishment protocol for a few minutes, watching as her water gauges climbed back up to full.\n\nRandy cracked open a new can of shitfaced, eyeing his scrubbers warily as he waited. This far out in the Fringes, the Ministry always tended to be lax in its environmental watchman routines. The boss had equipped his Mantis with the best scrubbers on the dark market, but any decent hint of strain out here would make quick work of anything short of military grade grafts. The best he could hope for if his sensors red-lined was enough warning to exorcise the affected components before things got critical.\n\nThankfully, nothing spiked Lassie's sensors and, in short order, he had her back on the road, her flashing arsenal of legs and wheels chewing into asphalt and overgrown vegetation alike.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nNighttime was when he did his best work.\n\nHis cold camp was set up on the edge of an overgrown ridge, a few metres off the shoulder of what had once been a way-stop. Stretched against a canvas of stars, a suppleskin awning strained against the wind. half an hour of work had seen it fastened to one side to Lassie's roof, and the other end to the railing that held back the abyss beyond. The result was a sort of open-ended trapezium that more or less got the job done.\n\nA quintet of chemical heat-sticks smouldered as the only meager light source in the middle of his set up, lending a dull vermilion light to his lonely pullout chair and the small pot he'd positioned over their over-priced lengths. Fires were always a bad idea, this far away from the Ministry line.\n\nBeneath Lassie's chassis, tongue between his teeth, Randy was hard at work.\n\nCarefully, meticulously, Randy worked his gripper into Lassie's undercarriage and fished out the last of the leeches that had found their way into his Mantis' wet systems.\n\n\"I'm not liking the company you keep picking up on these little trips of ours, girl\" he teased.\n\nSliding out from beneath her, he moved over to the sterilization station he'd set up and washed off the worst of the viscera from his ministrations. The frigid darkness beyond his encampment was an almost physical presence, bleeding in past the awning to test the edges of his little chemical heat bubble. Randy felt the goosebumps on his arms rising.\n\nPopping the juiciest of the leeches into the night's stew, he moved over to the railing and tossed the rest of the parasites into the blackness.\n\n*\\*Now, let's see what we're working with here...\\**\n\nOne hand dipped into his survival pack, pulling out a pair of binoculars. The other extracted a cold brew from the cooler he'd positioned next to the railing and took a long swig.\n\nFlipping a series of small switches on the binoculars' side, he looked around.\n\nThe view below snapped into high resolution greys, as the night succumbed to the power of an open-ended budget. The term 'Forest' didn't quite capture the virulent nature of the twisted colossal trees and undergrowth that stretched out all the way to the horizon. The Buzzards' intel had clued them in on how rampant and large the vegetation grew out on this particular stretch of the Fringe, but man...\n\nConsulting his memory, he remembered notes intimating the existence of an ancient outpost nestled somewhere in the middle of the greenery, but he'd be damned if he could spot it through the canopy. Randy took another swig, and cast about some more.\n\nUnderneath his breath, Randy muttered to himself, recalling the various maps he'd been forced to memorize, and matching them to some of the landmarks below. Roughly half an hour later, he spotted it.\n\nThe Ministry outpost came off as a dull blue blob nestled between two hillsides. The small cluster of buildings was as utilitarian as one would expect; pretty much par for the course when it came to Interior work.\n\nThe trees around its perimeter had been cleared, save for one particularly impressive specimen that curled and twisted around and through all of the compound's buildings and infrastructure. First-class Graft work, and probably the reason why the compound gave off so little heat.\n\nA trio of Road-hogs sat idly to the side of one of the buildings; a small company of Interior-men drilling on the lot next to it. Handy as they were in this sort of terrain, Road-hogs specialized in endurance and coverage, not speed. The threat they posed was minimal.\n\nUnfortunately, the Slither he spied wrapped and dangling underneath one of the grafted tree's thicker branches was a bit more concerning. Wet engineering at its finest, it didn't get more all-terrain than that.\n\nIf the outpost spotted him and deployed that monster of a vehicle before he'd made decent headway... Well, let's just say all the speed in the world wouldn't save him from a rig that could essentially move in a straight line through whatever it damn well pleased.\n\nRandy polished off his beer, plucking another from his cooler as he made his way over to the stew pot. Spooning over a generous helping of road-mix onto his plate, he flopped into his chair and began picking out the leafiest of the vegetables out of his broth.\n\nInevitably, he found his eyes drifting over to his cargo.\n\nSituated securely across the entire breadth and height of Lassie's backseat, the capsule pulsed softly.\n\nRandy leaned back into his chair, chewing as he considered the odd nature of his package, and the disquieting conversation he'd had with the boss before he'd set out.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n\"That sounds stupid as fuck. Not interested.\"\n\nRandy had no illusions about how smart he was. He was a Legman.\n\nBy choice.\n\nOver the course of seventeen runs, he'd lost an arm, four toes, a section of his liver, more teeth than he'd ever bothered to count, and his replacement arm (much to the chagrin of the Buzzards' Carvers).\n\nHe'd gotten them back, of course. Podge was a good boss. Took care of her own. But the meds that kept his grafts civil came out of his monthly pay, and that always stung.\n\nBut just because he was foolhardy, didn't mean he was dumb enough to walk face first into a zygote-beast's open jaws whenever it yawned.\n\nThe maw had cracked open when one of the Buzzards' errand boys had materialized at the Quagmire, wrecking his buzz with the news that Podge wanted to see him off-schedule. He'd tried to wave the kid off, but the little shit had insisted.\n\nThirty minutes later, Randy had found himself staring down a bottle of Podge's private reserve. A chilled glass had been pressed into his hand, and the Vulture herself had asked him politely to take a seat, clinking his glass as she took up a strategic position on the edge of her desk.\n\nEven through his buzz, the red flags had practically obscured Randy's vision.\n\n\"I see the Lamos run treated you well. Didn't think you'd be laced enough to go four rounds over at Don's place.\"\n\nRandy had tried to will the buzz away. It hadn't worked.\n\n\"Tusker might be a prick, but his jobs don't suck complete balls.\"\n\n\"Floor boys tell me it was a vitro package?\"\n\nRandy had nodded, and the world had tilted slightly. He'd sipped Podge's brandy anyways, and pretended not to see the corners of her eyes crinkle.\n\n\"Fertilized and everything.\"\n\nPodge frowned, swirling her drink. \"That's a brave thing to admit, considering I nixed those kinds of runs.\"\n\nIf it had been anyone else sitting across from the Vulture, the ice clinking in her glass might as well have been the sound of a piercer cocked against their dome. But Randy was one of Podge's best. And, seeing as she'd invited him into her inner sanctum during off hours, he doubted it was to chew him out over a successful job.\n\nThe bottled courage probably had something to do with him finding his stones.\n\n\"He told me about the deadline,\" he replied. \"Ten days at eighty five percent integrity guaranteed. Told him about your embargo. Fat bastard said he didn't care.\"\n\n\"Did he now...\"\n\nRandy had winced. Tusker wasn't exactly the sort of career criminal you narced on, but Podge was practically royalty on the Skims.\n\nFor a second, Randy considered putting down the brandy. It couldn't possibly be on his side. Then he'd thought about the supple leather underneath his arms and backside, and remembered when Podge had sent him to procure the suppleskin for its upholstery, all the way out in Revane.\n\n\"Easier to clean after,\" she'd said.\n\nHe'd thrown the whole glass back and winced. In for a sliver...\n\n\"If it's payback you're after, don't bother. Not sure what he had gestating in there, but the bastard stunk of desperation. Told him I'd only consider it if the slip-chit he was offering had at least one extra zero at the end.\"\n\n\"No way,\" Podge's expression softened into one of mirth, \"Ten times?\"\n\nRandy had reached into his jacket and extracted the chit in question, remanding it into her custody.\n\n\"Well I'll be. That is an extra zero at the end.\" she pronounced, flicking the little paper good-naturedly.\n\nDaring to dream, Randy had gotten up, moved over to the Vulture's liquor cabinet and poured himself another snifter of the good stuff. He'd turned around, pleasantly surprised that all his squishy parts were still in one place, and raised his glass to her.\n\n\"To desperate men.\"\n\nPodge's smile was a bit more reserved as she saluted him with her glass. Downing her drink, she joined him at her cabinet and poured herself another.\n\n\"Speaking of desperate men...\"\n\nPodge began talking, and there was no other way to say it.\n\nThe minutes that followed had her outlining a hell of madness so outlandish, that the delicious buzz that had been simmering in Randy's system all night practically evaporated. Podge hadn't even finished laying out the job before Randy had instinctively turned it down in the starkest of terms.\n\nThankfully, she hadn't seemed to have taken direct offense at the refusal.\n\n\"This coming from the man who made the Dilan-vough run in six days at ninety five? Come on Randy... What happened to the highway buccaneer that swaggered into my office fifteen minutes ago?\"\n\n\"Are you fucking with me? You just said the words Ministry, Fringes and Academy Project in the same fucking sentence. That's gonna be a hard no. The hardest of nos. Any one of those *alone* would have been a no.\"\n\nRandy had crinkled his brow, and continued. \"Frankly, this doesn't sound like your kind of gig either. Didn't you just almost chew me out for what was basically ferrying a handful of eggs across the continent?\"\n\nPodge hadn't replied immediately. For a few extended minutes, she'd studied him, slowly swirling her drink as she did so.\n\nRandy had resisted the urge to fidget by studying her latest arm.\n\nIt was bulkier than her last one. The overall design was clearly lobster themed, with a full-on pincer and actuated sections all along its length. But, in lieu of the standard chitin, a thick waxy material served as the limbs primary protective layer. He'd watched in a mild trance as, every time she swirled her glass, he could almost see the muscles beneath moving in tandem.\n\nRandy had lost money on that. No one had thought she'd go back to a nautical theme.\n\nWith a sigh, Podge moved over to her desk and begun rifling through her top drawer.\n\n\"Do you believe in luck Randy?\"\n\n\"Don't know anyone in this line of work who doesn't.\"\n\nPodge tossed two folders onto her desk and sat down, gesturing at the pair.\n\n\"Well, there's luck and then there's winning the fucking lottery.\"\n\nRandy looked over and saw that the folders had two names. One was his. the other was Podge's.\n\nHe hadn't known her second name was Celery. Unfortunate.\n\n\"Can...\", and he gestured over at his folder.\n\n\"Be my guest.\"\n\nHe'd slid the document over to himself, opened it and looked its contents over.\n\nThere had been a letter in there addressed to him. Handwritten in the neatest penmanship he'd ever seen. Its author made the same case Podge had. But the further in Randy read, the more the realization dawned on him.\n\nThe zygote-beast yawned.\n\nWhoever this client was, they knew him. Intimately. Utterly.\n\nInvasively.\n\nFor six straight pages, he'd been peeled back, layer by layer, until his core had been completely exposed. Then, just before it could all overwhelm him, he'd arrived at the offer. And Randy couldn't have hit closer to home if he'd written it himself.\n\nRandy didn't know how long he'd sat there, stunned.\n\n\"Did...Have you read this?\"\n\nPodge had the grace to look a little contrite. \"I did. Sorry.\"\n\nRandy's eyes drifted down to her folder.\n\n\"Not a chance in hell.\" Podge leaned back into her chair and tilted her head up to the ceiling. \"But it was pretty much the same deal. Took a knife to my soul, then made me an offer I really don't want to refuse.\"\n\nThe silence that followed was charged with possibilities.\n\n\"Can they even, you know, do everything they say they can?\"\n\n\"Spent the last two week confirming that. As far as I can tell, yes.\"\n\nRandy swallowed. Moving back to the cabinet, he returned with two whole bottles. Wordlessly, they drained their glasses and claimed a bottle each.\n\nPodge was the first to crack. \"Everything in me. Everything that's gotten me to this point in my life, says this is too good to be true.\"\n\nRandy hadn't known what to say.\n\n\"I do this, and I get my war chest. I get an in with sort of powerful fucks who wouldn't know me from a stain on the bottom of their shoe. Dirt on Reckham and his Suicide Boys. Supply lines. And a whole bunch of other shit I really really want to have besides. It's a lot. It's almost too much.\"\n\n\"And all you have do is stick your dick in crazy.\"\n\n\"Not how I'd put it, but...yes. Pretty much.\" Podge begun combing through her hair with her lobster arm. It looked as strange as it sounded.\n\n\"So level with me. You're five for five when it comes to fringe runs. And clearly, our client seems to know that. Any other day, I'd laugh this sort of shit right off my desk. But not today. Today, I’ve got to know.\"\n\nShe'd leaned closer. The alcohol on her breath was potent, but her eyes were as clear as ice.\n\n\"Can it be done?\"\n\nRandy hadn't stopped turning the problem over in his head ever since he'd heard it. There was a way. A very narrow, very dangerous way, but...\n\n\"I'm gonna need a lot of stuff.\"\n\n\"Done.\"\n\n\"Nope. Too quick. I'm not fucking around with this. I'm gonna give you a list. If we can't get even one of the things I need in good time, that's it. We walk away.\"\n\n\"Accepted. Anything else?\"\n\nRandy lifted one of the letters from the folder.\n\n\"This paragraph here says they included some mix-tapes in their package?\"  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nRandy catalyzed the heat sticks and stretched. Dismantling his camp in the velvety dark was an almost passive affair. Marking off a mental checklist, Randy erased all traces of his overnight activities and ran one final set of checks on his Mantis.\n\nA few minutes later, he was safely ensconced back within Lassie's interior, his seat angled back as far as his mysterious cargo would allow. Sleepily, he traced its symphony of blinking lights, scattered as they were across its bulk like bio-luminescent eyes. Their cadence had an almost hypnotic quality to it, though Randy was annoyed to find that the mild hum it emitted didn't hold to the same rhythm as the lights.\n\n\"The fuck are you?\"\n\nReaching over, he touched its surface, his fingers curious. It felt like nothing he'd ever known. Like if he held his palm against it long enough, it'd meld to his skin and never let go.\n\nPodge had called it organic metal. Randy had - rather wisely, in his opinion - told her that he didn't want to know what the hell that even was.\n\nRandy settled in for the night.\n\nHe dreamed about letters.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*  \n\"Fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK!\"\n\nLassie's core was a raging inferno beneath him as he pumped his pedals and swerved hard into the carcass of a highway. The ghost of an abandoned city loomed ahead, a tantalizing target, but a nigh unreachable one if luck wasn't on his side.\n\nThe blood thudding through his ears wasn't enough to drown out the sound of shattering trees and torn earth that crashed in his wake, boiling onto the cracked asphalt in a tidal wave of wreckage and destruction. The Slither within hissed, its gargantuan bulk curling and unfurling through the dust.\n\nSweat flew from his brow. It'd been almost forty minutes since he'd hooked himself up to Lassie's adrenal-line. The fatigue was draining, but the link to her wetware lent him an almost preternatural connection to her systems. Her gripper grafts chewed into the asphalt, the force from the sudden acceleration slamming him into his seat's leather.\n\nA proportional fucking response. He'd seriously expected a proportional fucking response. From the fucking Ministry.\n\nTo be fair, Lassie's sensors had worked; picking out the moment they'd run through the nigh invisible web-sensor arrays that the Ministry had infested all around the region.\n\nRealistically, any Legman worth their extensions knew better than to waste time avoiding a well laid out web array. Inexpensive, almost unavoidable and nigh invisible; as long as you didn't mind completely decimating the local insect population, a good web array was pretty much game over when it came to locking down ground routes.\n\nAnyone who worked the Fringes called them Welcome Mats, seeing as they tended to practically cover everything in sight, and physically denote the Ministry's presence within an area at the same time. Most Legmen didn't even factor in the informational challenges they posed anymore, preferring to think of them as the business equivalent of taxes, or waving hello to the competition.\n\nRandy had anticipated a 'friendly' wave back. A scouting party of Hogs sent on an intercept trajectory. Maybe even a Streaker in the sky to track his movements. He'd hoped to use the time they'd spend probing at him to build a considerable lead before he let Lassie off her leash.\n\nIt'd been a good plan. Up until forty five minutes ago, when, out of nowhere, the forest had exploded, and a snake the size of a small train had almost swallowed him whole. Then the chase had begun. A chase that had almost seen him caught within the Slither's coils no less than four times.\n\nRandy let Lassie feed, stoking the furnace at her core. Grafts steamed and her gauges screamed at him in protest. The highway yawned ahead, and Randy mentally unclenched. The adrenaline line fused to his spine translated his intentions faster than any switch. He felt several rows of inhibitors shut off as he judged the road ahead to be clear enough, and gave Lassie her head.\n\nThrough the haze of his fatigue, he fought to hold on to his consciousness as the countryside bled into a green blur. Overclocked systems drank in oxygen and protein, and spat out speed.\n\nThe Mantis' sensors clocked the minute whoever was operating the Slither came to terms with their disadvantage along a fairly straight stretch, its hissing, chittering mass falling further and further behind as Lassie did what she did best. He watched as the operator slowed down, coiling the Slither's mass inside a large water-clogged crater on one side of the road. The water within churned and boiled, as it struggled to cool the creature's overheated musculature.\n\n\"Yes! Get fucked!\" Randy made to punch the air, but found the most he could do was raise his arm slightly as a wave of exhaustion and heat rolled over him. The withdrawal from this was going to be rough.\n\nHis transplants whispered the extent of Lassie's damage, a litany that almost smothered the sense of hope that the receding monster in his rear view engendered.\n\nAhead, the corpse that was once Fennerstone leaned out of the afternoon gloom. This close to Revane's border, Randy knew better than to hope that the clouds would eventually clear. Randy swallowed his disappointment. The photo-cells on Lassie's roof would have been a fairly convenient means of topping off some of her feeder lines back to baseline. He groaned as some of her fatigue and damage translated into a series of rolling muscle cramps all along his back.\n\nLassie's rear sensors flashed. A small migraine crawled along the left side of his face as he sharpened the dwindling embers of his focus to pull on her perception and study the disturbance.\n\nIt would seem the Slither was not done with him yet.\n\nShrouded in the steam emanating from its crater, massive coils roiled and wrapped around themselves. Its head angled upwards, its jaw fully unhinging and dripping with venom. Two massive hoods flared out on both sides of its head. The heat from their patterned mass made the air around and above the Slither's head and scales dance and waver.\n\nHe watched as it inhaled the surrounding air, the steam and dust in it immediate environs spiraling into the depths of its gullet.\n\nPanic saw Randy opening the throttle on the last of his two feeder lines. The wave of bone deep exhaustion that washed over him through the adrenal-line had him seeing dark spots. Through the fog of his mind, Fennerstone's reclamation border beaconed.\n\nThe Slither's entire body seemed to ripple as it spat. Venom-tinged steam shrouded its enormous form once more. Randy thought he cursed. He couldn't be sure anymore. The thing seeping into his mind and smothering his thoughts was beginning to throw its weight around. Randy felt Lassie shiver beneath him as he pulled on her dregs.\n\nHis attention was a dwindling currency, and he chose to expend it studying the sky for something that he could dodge.\n\nWhen his overhead sensors blossomed to the tune of thousands of emerald droplets dappled against a rumbling sky, he fought back his despair as he switched to damage control.\n\nThe first of the gelatinous droplets splashed against his hood just as Lassie sailed across Fennerstone's city marker. Randy overrode Lassie's warning systems before they could wail at him. With a thought, scrubber mites crawled onto the sizzling mess and got to work.\n\nThe second droplet slammed into his roof, corroding through before he could queue up any commands. The frigid wind that blasted into his cockpit was almost a relief, before the smell of sizzling leather and metal seared his nose. Enzymes ate through his cans and passenger seat in seconds, scrubber mites scrambling to halt their progress through his floor.\n\nSomething slammed into Lassie's rear and Randy found he couldn't muster up enough focus to pull up the sensory information. His speed began to bleed.\n\nRandy's thoughts were beginning to melt into each other, when he spied the husk of an old feeder station, its rusted canopy leaning to one side, but - more importantly - its stone masonry seemingly weathering the worst of the deadly rain.\n\nWith the last wisps of his waning thoughts, Randy pulled into the station, Lassie's limping mass shouldering aside an old abandoned Beetle as it squeezed between a cracked support pillar and the rusted machinery beneath it.\n\nThe last thing he recalled was the smell of digested metal and approaching rain as finally, blessedly, the darkness overtook him.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nThe molasses of Randy's consciousness dripped back behind his eyes. Randy blinked. Once. Twice. On the third try, his strung-out body deigned to grace his efforts with some amount of moisture.\n\nLassie's interior was dark, illuminated only by a handful of gauges and feed lights. Somewhere to his left, the reedy sound of his mix-tape garbled softly at him, caught in a low power loop. Beneath him, Lassie core sat cold and lifeless and the wan smell of inert effluvia wafted up from somewhere beneath him.\n\nRandy shifted, groaning as he tried to sit up. Nothing happened. His body ignored his commands for what felt like eons. Eventually, he gave in to the inevitable and sighed.\n\nRandy recognized the side effects of lactic poisoning. Adrenal-links were illegal for a reason, after all. As he recalled, Podge had almost balked at its inclusion when she'd seen his list of asks. But ultimately, she hadn't stopped him. She'd understood what they were up against, and his need for an edge. Any edge. Even if that end turned out to be double-sided.\n\nA soft buzz suffused his thoughts as he tried not to panic. Wait...not a buzz. That was rain. It was raining.\n\nLike an unwelcome stranger, the outside world intruded on Randy's misery in the form of staccato applause. Somewhere in the darkness beyond his windshield, rain was falling. Was it night already? How long had be been knocked out?\n\nRandy listened for a while as he breathed, long and measured, counting back from a hundred and working through the problem.\n\nHe had to take stock.\n\nRandy mentally braced himself. He was going to be effectively paralyzed for a few days. That was bad. If he was being completely honest, it was potentially catastrophic. Pretty much all his options sucked.\n\nLuckily, none of this was new information. This run had always been a stupid idea from the start. And, even with the shitty cards he'd been dealt, he wasn't even at the really hard part yet.\n\nFirst though, if he was going to try and make it out of this, he'd have to do something desperate. Again.\n\nRandy braced himself.\n\nHe could feel the cold kiss of the adrenal-line still fused to the back of his neck, as well as the thin susurrus of feedback that whispered through it. Tentatively, he sent out a weak probe towards Lassie's soft-mind. Almost immediately, he was met with a wave of exhaustion so pervasive that, by the time he'd blinked his way through the worst of the dark spots, Randy suspected that he'd lost a handful of hours, judging from the dryness of his throat and the dimmer lights.\n\nNothing clicked.\n\nHe tried again, this time blacking out long enough that, by the time the darkness receded, the sound system was dead and several gauges were inert. This time though, he'd been successful. Lassie's systems crooned weakly at him through the link and Randy absorbed all the information he could.\n\nThe capsule was OK. Better than OK actually, it was virtually unharmed. Whatever the blasted thing was made of, it seemed to have weathered the worst of the encounter pretty much unscathed. It was also the reason why, if the sensors were to be believed, his cockpit hadn't been crushed like a cheap can when the canopy of the feeder station he'd taken refuge under had finally succumbed to the acidic deluge and collapsed.\n\nThat explained the constant darkness every time he woke up. Lassie was pretty much a coffin, at this point.\n\nHer feeders were empty, and most critical systems were damaged far beyond repair. The only reason Lassie hadn't completely shut down on him seemed to be an odd nascent connection emanating from the capsule itself. Whatever it was, it was keeping Lassie's core powered and coherent, even if only just. A curious discovery, but Randy wasn't inclined to ask any gift horses for their dentals any time soon. He’d take any luck he could get.\n\n*Activate the beacon.*\n\nSomething like compliance washed through the system. The last of the lights in his cockpits went off as power was redirected toward the most expensive piece of wetware that he'd put on his list.\n\nRandy had no idea how Podge had done it. When he'd included a genuine Ministry Soft-mind on his shopping list, he'd watched her face lose all its color. She hadn't spoken. They both knew what he was asking her to do. Three days later - a handful of hours before his deadline - she'd walked into his garage, slammed the accursed graft onto his workbench and walked out.\n\nEventually, word came down from one of his Carver's wetboys; of midnight gang massacres and hackles raised all across the Skim's criminal powerhouses. Of raids on storage depots and a small army on its way from Regional Administration to clean up house, once and for all. The boss had kicked every hornet's nest and ant hill from Revane to Medholme looking for what he'd asked for, spitting in the face of every power that was as she did it.\n\nJust before he'd left, she'd knocked on his side window and he'd rolled it down.\n\n\"You never told me why it had to be a Mantis.\"\n\nRandy had scratched the back of his head, mildly embarrassed.\n\n\"Childhood dream. Had one mocking me across from my desk or bed in every room I ever called my own, for as long as I can remember.\"\n\nPodge had nodded.\n\n\"Looks like we're all remembering what it's like to dream these days.\"\n\nRandy hadn't replied. The fact that he'd toned his music to give her the time of day was answer enough.\n\n\"Things are going to hurt for a while back here. So, go.\" She pronounced, smacking his roof twice to emphasize her point. \"Dream big, and ride hard. I'm counting on you.\"\n\nWhen Randy had left that day, he'd known it was the beginning of something. His plan to use the Ministry Soft-mind as a decoy had fallen apart. There wasn't much he could do about that. The minute he'd turned it on while it was still connected to his Mantis, and, by extension, to himself, his fate had been sealed. The Ministry was going to find him.\n\nThe darkness crept back, a welcome respite from the thirst and the despair.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n Skriiitch Skriiitch.\n\nSomething...\n\nSkriiitch Skriiitch Skriiitch.\n\nSomething was happening...\n\nThe sludge that was Randy's mind took a while before it could recall the requisite commands to open one's eyes. Something was outside his window, scratching at the glass. He couldn't quite see it, but whatever it was, it was big. A light glided somewhere behind it, and its shadow danced across his dashboard.\n\nWhen had all the lights in his cockpit gone off? How long had he been out? Worried, he reached out to Lassie's Soft-mind through his adrenal-line. An eternity ticked by, before a weak signal tapped him back. He almost cried with relief.\n\n Someone's here, girl. Someone heard us.\n\nThe light bobbed a little closer, shaking in tune to the sound of shifting metal and masonry.\n\n\"....like he found something. Not sure what though. Fudge can't seem to eat it, so it's not meat.\"\n\nRandy gulped. Was that the sound that had woken him up? Whatever the thing on the outside was had been trying to eat him?\n\n\"Looks like we have to get in then. Foley, hat's our E.T?\"\n\nSomething shuddered, as the masonry outside shifted. The smell of wet coral wafted in through the hole in his roof, and another light joined the first.\n\n\"Four minutes.\"\n\n\"Noted. Meerkat, you have the perimeter. Sideshow, what can you see in there?\"\n\nThe shadows bobbed some more, and, somewhere within the sludge, Randy noticed that they were making the migraine that he'd almost forgotten to notice exponentially worse. Someone whistled appreciatively. Randy cursed their entirely bloodline when its reverberations made him see colors.\n\n\"Looks like someone forgot how to park a million chits where the sky wouldn't fall on them.\"\n\n\"Elaborate?\"\n\n\"Give me a second. Need to move Fudge out of the way so I can get a better look.\"\n\nThe shadows moved out of the way, and Randy almost closed his eyes in time. Almost. The knife that lanced through his brain at the sudden glare shook the last of his drowsiness away from him. Resignedly, he also registered that he was still too paralyzed to scream in pain.\n\n\"Looks like a Mantis. 2018 Scythe. Heavily modded. And I mean heavily.\" Randy risked a peek between his eyelashes and watched as the twin lights drifted along his windows. \"Someone's still inside. Looks like the driver.\"\n\n\"And the objective?\"\n\n\"Probably whatever he's got wedged in the back seat.\"\n\nThe lights drifted somewhere behind him.\n\n\"Huh. It's holding a lot of weight back there.\"\n\nThe sound of shifting masonry paused.\n\n\"Shit. Is it going to be a problem?\"\n\n\"Hmm...\"\n\nWhoever was peering into his little mausoleum took their time taking in the situation, the twin lights shifting back and forth.\n\n\"Doesn't look like the cargo's at risk. From the looks of it, it took a beating when the canopy came down, and it's still intact. Not sure about the driver though. Your call, Toucan.\"\n\nThe reply wasn't long in coming.\n\n\"Is the scout stasis-capable?\"\n\n\"Had the Carvings done last month.\"\n\n\"Then we can afford to make mistakes. I'm taking those odds. Get us in there.\"\n\nThat's what you get for not paying your taxes, Randy thought to himself darkly as the sound of crunching coral resumed. Gradually, whatever they were doing behind him got louder and louder, until, eventually, something large gave way and shook the ground alarmingly beneath him. Soft warm light pooled around the edges of his vision, prickling his eyes and bathing the world around him in a uniform wan glow.\n\nIf it weren't for the fact that he'd been nestled in a pocket of nearly utter silence for who knows how long, Randy wouldn't have caught the nearly inaudible footfalls that padded his way, before whoever it was shone a light directly in his face through his window.\n\n\"It's a he. Looks like he's not dead yet.\"\n\nThe voice sounded male, though Randy couldn't confirm his hypothesis on account of the light blinding him.\n\n\"SitRep?\"\n\n\"Blue lips. Mild necrosis along his neck. Crushed left leg. Poor sap's in bad shape.\" The light cast about the interior of his cockpit. \"From the looks of it, whoever he is, he didn't get the chance to decouple himself from his rig before things went south. Worst case of lactic shock I've ever seen. Damn...how the hell is he not dead?\"\n\nThey don't call Skimmers cockroaches for nothing... Wait, did he say crushed left leg?\n\n\"You can ask him yourself once we have him back to baseline.\" A woman's voice, brusque, carrying the same brisk confidence Podge wore so easily. \"Get him out of there. I want him in stasis as soon as possible. Foley, set up support struts and lighting. You and I are getting inside this thing and getting the target out.\"\n\nA chorus of affirmatives saw the light shift away from Randy's face.\n\n\"Doors are sealed, but I can see a hole in the roof. Sending Fudge in first to stabilize him.\"\n\nStill attempting to blink the spots out of his eyes, Randy felt more than he saw something move over his window and onto his roof, shifting the car's bulk as it did so. A small shower of loose coral skittered into Randy's cockpit.\n\n\"Not much wiggle room up here. Going to have to drip\"\n\n\"Give us two minutes to set up a light source or two. Then you can go in.\"\n\nRandy tried to get a good look at whatever it was they were doing out of the corner of his eye. No dice. Bullishly, he tried once again to move his head, but stopped once spots began to cloud his vision. Pale white light sparked to his left and somewhere behind him.\n\nThe bulk on the roof shifted around for a handful of seconds, before Randy felt something wet splash down somewhere to his left. Gelatinous globules of flesh dropped from the mangled roof, splashing into the wet pool of effluvia where his passenger seat used to be. Out of the edge of his vision, he watched as each loose bit of wet translucent flesh sought out its compatriots, slowly coalescing into something that vaguely resembled a fleshy slug the size of bear.\n\nZygote-beast. Shit.\n\n\"I'm in.\"\n\n\"Get started.\"\n\nCold loose flesh oozed its way on to his lap, hundreds of tendrils germinating all along its length. Randy tried to scream, but this time the darkness gurgled back, and didn't seem to care.  \n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*",

      "content": "###Welcome to **Fun Trope Friday, our feature that mashes up tropes and genres!**\n\nHow’s it work? Glad you asked. :)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **Every week we will have a new spotlight trope.**\n\n- **Each week, there will be a new genre assigned to write a story about the trope.**\n\n- **You can then either use or subvert the trope in a 750-word max story or poem (unless otherwise specified).**\n\n- **To qualify for ranking, you will need to provide ONE actionable feedback. More are welcome of course!**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThree winners will be selected each week based on votes, so remember to read your fellow authors’ works and **DM me your votes** for the top three.\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\nNext up… **[IP](https://www.deviantart.com/binkari/art/042411-Website-Redhead-206297426)** \n\n&nbsp;\n\nMax Word Count: **750 words**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nThis month, we’re exploring the dynamics of ‘family.’ Love yours or hate ‘em, we’re all typically part of one. So let’s see what that means. Please note this theme is only loosely applied. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Trope: [Red-Headed Stepchild](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RedHeadedStepchild)** — Children can be bullied for no other reason than the color of their hair, which is a terrible thing! This expression relates back to the era of the integration of Irish and Italian families in the late 19th century. The [top three countries](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/percentage-of-redheads-by-country) for having natural redheads are the US (18m), Ireland (7m), and Scotland (6m). The UK leads by population percentage with 8.4%. Nowadays, many people dye their hair to get the glow of those fiery recessive locks–so rock on redheads! \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Genre: [Mystery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_fiction)** — Mystery is a fiction genre where the nature of an event, usually a murder or other crime, remains mysterious until the end of the story.[1] Often within a closed circle of suspects, each suspect is usually provided with a credible motive and a reasonable opportunity for committing the crime.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Skill / Constraint - optional: Takes place in Ireland.**\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSo, have at it. Lean into the trope heavily or spin it on its head. The choice is yours!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave a great idea for a future topic to discuss or just want to give feedback? FTF is a fun feature, so it’s all about what you want—so please let me know! Please share in the comments or DM me on Discord or Reddit!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n**Last Week’s Winners**\n\nPLEASE remember to give feedback—this affects your ranking. PLEASE also remember to DM me your votes for the top three stories via Discord or Reddit—both katpoker666. If you have any questions, please DM me as well.\n\nSome fabulous stories this week and great crit at campfire and on the post! Congrats to:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n- **[Divayth--Fyr](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/s/emK6hHJfIG)**\n\n- **[Tregonial](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/s/RqS9xqijzd)**\n\n- **[prejackpot](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/s/oQiZTasZiB)**\n\n&nbsp;\n\n***\n\n###**Want to read your words aloud? Join the upcoming FTF Campfire**\n\nThe next FTF campfire will be **Thursday, June 5th from 6-8pm EDT**. It will be in the Discord Main Voice Lounge. Click on the events tab and mark ‘Interested’ to be kept up to date. No signup or prep needed and don’t have to have written anything! So join in the fun—and shenanigans! 😊\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\n###Ground rules:\n\n- Stories must incorporate both the trope and the genre\n- Leave one story or poem between 100 and 750 words as a top-level comment unless otherwise specified. Use wordcounter.net to check your word count.\n- Deadline: 11:59 PM EDT next Thursday. Please note stories submitted after the 6:00 PM EST campfire start may not be critted. \n- No stories that have been written for another prompt or feature here on WP—please note after consultation with some of our delightful writers, new serials are now welcomed here\n- No previously written content\n- Any stories not meeting these rules will be disqualified from rankings\n- Does your story not fit the Fun Trope Friday rules? You can post your story as a [PI] with your work when the FTF post is 3 days old!\n- Vote to help your favorites rise to the top of the ranks (DM me at katpoker666 on Discord or Reddit)!\n\n&nbsp;\n***\n\nThanks for joining in the fun!\n\n***",

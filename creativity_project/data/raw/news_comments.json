        "body": ">The grieving parents of a 7-year-old child who died hours after being hit by a car were charged with involuntary manslaughter after allowing him and his brother, 10, to walk home unaccompanied by an adult from a nearby grocery store.\n\n>Jessica Ivey and Samuele Jenkins were charged two days after their son Legend died from injuries caused by being struck by a Jeep on May 27 in Gastonia, a rural town in North Carolina. The 76-year-old driver will not face any charges.\n\n>The Food Lion store is two blocks away from their home. The parents said the children were with their mother when they asked to meet their father at the store, and she allowed them to leave, according to [The Gaston Gazette](https://www.gastongazette.com/story/news/crime/2025/05/29/parents-of-7-year-old-boy-charged-in-fatal-wreck/83928393007/). The brothers had to cross the busy, four-lane road, but attempted to go between crosswalks.\n\n>[Witnesses told WSOC-TV](https://www.wsoctv.com/news/local/7-year-old-boy-hit-killed-near-gastonia-grocery-store/WFHQVJ2U4NDGRHXC5PLXAPBBKM/) of Charlotte that Legend stepped into traffic as his older brother attempted to hold him back.\n\nThat's ridiculous. The store was just two blocks away and one child went between crosswalks rather than crossing at the proper spot while the other child tried to prevent it. How that's on the parents makes no sense. Parents are given far less for knowingly leaving their child in a hot car.\n\nIt's bad enough that most North American cities are made for cars and not people; it's cruel to punish parents for a circumstance that costs them the life of their child.",

You open the doors for white South Africans, give them free housing, roll out the red carpet like it’s Ellis Island 2.0, but at the same time you’re banning Black and brown nations like Haiti, Congo, and Sudan from even stepping foot on the soil? That’s not national security. That’s racial engineering.\n\nYou’re not building a safer country. You’re curating a whiter one.\n\nThis is what white supremacy dressed in a suit looks like. It’s policy that says your skin color determines your worth. It’s protection for some, punishment for the rest. You don’t need a hood or a burning cross when you’ve got executive orders and immigration bans doing the same work.\n\nAnd the fact that people still defend this is beyond me. Still saying “he says what others are thinking.” If that’s true, then what they’re thinking is disgusting.\n\nYou ban Haitians, but let white South Africans in and call it humanitarian. You strip protections from Sudanese refugees fleeing war, but call yourself pro-life. You target Congolese families escaping violence, but talk about law and order. You cherry pick the people you think deserve to live, to work, to dream, all based on what? Their passport? Their melanin?\n\nThis isn’t immigration policy. It’s apartheid with better branding.\n\nEvery Haitian, every African, every person from the diaspora should see this for what it is. It’s not about borders. It’s not about safety. It’s about shaping America in one image. And if you don’t fit that image, they’re coming for you next.",

Neither protests nor force can touch it. Reasoning is of no use. Facts that contradict personal prejudices can simply be disbelieved — indeed, the fool can counter by criticizing them, and if they are undeniable, they can just be pushed aside as trivial exceptions. So the fool, as distinct from the scoundrel, is completely self-satisfied. In fact, they can easily become dangerous, as it does not take much to make them aggressive. For that reason, greater caution is called for than with a malicious one. Never again will we try to persuade the stupid person with reasons, for it is senseless and dangerous.”\n\n* Dietrich Bonhoeffer",

Based on current actions, the current Trump administration will either ignore the order - but they usually do this when the target of the arrest is out of the country, or puts up road blocks.  Hence the Republicans now putting in language in the proposed budget bill not allowing courts to hold government agents in contempt for violating court orders - aka violating the law.\n  1. If the person is in the country, they're likely to be released - while suffering the trauma of being wrongfully arrested (or these days not even the target of the arrest, or actually being a US citizen ICE just didn't are if they were a citizen or not, etc, etc etc.)\n\nI believe and hope the above is the most likely scenario - and should Trump and his ilk and the Republicans in office get voted out, Republicans will do to the next Demorat what they always do:  blame them for working to fix the problem Republians caused and tell people how \"We Republicans would do it better, and do it for freeee!\"  (See also:  [Republican after the great depression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pb-7Dpp-LPk), after the 2008 collaspse, etc etc etc.)\n\nThere is another scenario that I really worry about:\n\n1. The courts decide \"Welllllll sure there's precident saying the constitution applies to anyone in this country whether their a citizen or not - but we decided that no longer applies because INSERT BULLSHIT REASON HERE THAT REALLY BOILS DOWN TO WE DON'T THINK TRUMP OR HIS ALLIES WILL EAT OUR FACES LATER.\"\n1.

Note the lack of 'contiguous' below, so you can't directly compare 'completed guideway' number from the Wikipedia quote to the following CHSRA quote:\n\n* Construction is active across 119 miles in the Central Valley, with 85 out of 93 structures underway or completed, 96 miles of guideway completed, and 99 percent of properties needed in hand.\n* 463 miles of the 494-mile Phase 1 system between San Francisco and Anaheim are environmentally cleared and construction ready.\n* Design and pre-construction activities are underway to extend the 119-mile Central Valley segment to 171 miles from Merced to Bakersfield.",

(7News) — The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Virginia announced the seizure of approximately 145 darknet and traditional internet domains, along with cryptocurrency funds associated with the BidenCash marketplace.\n\n>The marketplace, which began operations in March 2022, was used to facilitate the buying and selling of stolen credit cards and personal information.\n\n>BidenCash administrators charged fees for transactions on the site, which grew to support over 117,000 customers and facilitated the trafficking of over 15 million payment card numbers and personal data. The marketplace generated over $17 million in revenue during its operations.\n\n>The seized domains will now redirect to a U.S. law enforcement-controlled server to prevent further criminal activity. The marketplace also sold compromised credentials for unauthorized computer access.\n\n>Between October 2022 and February 2023, BidenCash published 3.3 million stolen credit cards for free to promote its services. The stolen data included credit card numbers, expiration dates, CVV numbers, account holder names, addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers.\n\n>Court records indicate that the United States obtained authorization to seize cryptocurrency funds used by BidenCash to receive illicit proceeds.\n\n>The announcement was made by Erik S. Siebert, U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia; John Szydlik, Resident Agent in Charge of the U.S. Secret Service’s Frankfurt Resident Office; and Philip Russell, Acting Special Agent in Charge of the FBI Albuquerque Field Office.",

A jury found Naser guilty of attempting to provide material support to ISIS and being a felon in possession of a destructive device.\n\n>According to evidence presented at his trial, Naser became radicalized and posted \"extreme Salafi-Jihadist ideological content\" on YouTube, later forming a relationship with Russell Dennison, who officials say was an \"aspiring Salafi-Jihadist preacher.\" The two traveled to Iraq together in early 2012, according to federal attorneys. \n\n\n>Naser returned to Michigan in August 2012, while Dennison visited Syria and joined a terrorist organization that officials say was a precursor to ISIS. Naser reportedly made plans to join Dennison and attempted twice to leave the U.S. for Syria. \n\n>Dennison is believed to have been killed in 2019 while with ISIS. \n\n>Officials say Naser first attempted to fly to Syria from Detroit Metro Airport in November 2012 but was denied boarding. He later reportedly bought a one-way ticket from Chicago O'Hare Airport to Beirut, Lebanon, in January 2013. \n\n>Shortly before his flight to Lebanon, Naser allegedly robbed a gas station and then took a bus to Chicago, where he attempted to board a flight with $2,000 but was denied boarding and returned to Michigan. Naser was later charged and convicted of armed robbery and served three years in prison. \n\n>Following his release from prison and unable to travel to join ISIS, officials say Naser focused on how he could support ISIS from the U.S. Naser reportedly created social media accounts and joined ISIS supporters' private rooms, groups and chatrooms. The groups were by invitation only, and officials say Naser received and viewed official ISIS media reports and publications. Naser allegedly also began experimenting with operating drones and manufacturing explosives. \n\n>In October 2017, the FBI searched his home and vehicle and reportedly found a \"readily assembleable destructive device.\"\n\n\n>\"Defendant Aws Mohammed Naser is a bombmaker and self-avowed 'son of the Islamic State' — a vicious foreign terrorist organization hell-bent on murdering Americans and destroying our way of life,\" said U.S. Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon, Jr. \"Naser tried to travel and fight for ISIS overseas but was turned away. So, Naser turned his fight inward on America, gathered drones, and built a bomb in his basement. But our office is dedicated to finding and applying the full force of the law against any terrorist, like Naser, plotting to harm Americans.\"  \n\n>Naser faces up to 20 years in prison for attempting to provide material support to a designated terrorist organization and up to 15 years for possessing a destructive device.",

(the animated film?)\n\nWay worse!  Because it's in the middle of a National Park and wilderness, there are limited methods for restricting or killing rodents and insects and what is done is mostly ineffective.  \n\n...Although most rodent and insect overpopulation is both non-native and caused primarily by - and in many cases only because of - human presence and activity.  \n\nHey, government!  Want to make National Parks and Public Lands better?  Fix the rodent and insect problems caused by humans being dirty slobs and leaving garbage and food everywhere to attract the pests.  And pest-proof the buildings, inns, hotels, shops, offices, visitor centers and facilities.  \n\nTalk to any facilities and maintenance staff:  pests, especially rodents are a huge perpetual problem.\n\nTwo quickies:  \n\n1 - \n\nNational Park site having extensive renovations done and building closed and vacant for some time.  Everyone knew:  rodents will take over and run rampant in the building.  Classic U.S. Gov't.:  Spent $$$K's to study the problem and propose a complex $$M's solution.  \n\nLocal facilities chief:  That's all B.S.  Don't spend any money even to study it.  Buy some insulation and caulk and steel wool and plug up the holes and spaces where pests are getting in and out.  \n\nAnd then we go to the local animal shelter and pick up a couple of cats.  For the cost of some cat litter and a little food (not too much!) we'll have a rodent free building the whole time.  Worked perfectly!  Only small challenge was finding homes for the cats once the remodel and rehab was done.  Easy!:  Keep them!  They work!  \n\nObjection to the cats:  They're not native!  They'll go feral and skew the local wildlife populations.  \n\nAnswer:  Oh, and the overpopulation of rodents and roaches and other pests is 'native and natural?'  Nope!  The cats are from the shelter and already 'fixed' so no kittens.  \n\n2 - \n\nTo save money and improve efficiency some National Parks were forced to eliminate and reduce public toilets, trash bins and waste collection and contracts for waste and sanitation services.  \n\nAny guesses what happened?  Yup!  Bing Bing Bing!  \n\nHuman waste at roadsides and viewing areas, behind trees and bushes, deposited in trash and recycling containers, just left anywhere ... on the ground.  \n\nTrash containers overflowed, littering rampant, trash and waste problems everywhere.  A real mess.  Rodents, insects, scavengers, native and non-native critters and bugs went wild, scattered the mess further, reproduced like mad and attracted the larger predators.  It was a glorious and tremendous disaster.  \n\nAnd experienced managers and workers knew this would happen, warned it would and then had to take care of the extra costs and efforts of clean-up and remediation once the 'experts' and politicians realized the mess they'd made.  \n\nIs this starting to sound familiar?  Political hacks driving government efficiency without involving local field front-line experienced staff, managers and leaders.  That's not efficiency.  It's called stupidity.  Hubris.  And it is costing and will yet cost untold billions and drag the U.S. down the fast track to failure.  \n\nIf the U.S. does not fail it will not be because of misguided, mismanaged and naive efficiency efforts gone horribly wrong.  The U.S. will survive because of the work ethic, the innovation and dedication of federal workers and their partners and constituents who will find ways to keep it from failing.  \n\nThe best government workforce anywhere will succeed in spite of efforts to decimate and destroy, demonize and disenfranchise, dismiss and discourage them.  They are already rising to the occasion and will somehow continue to do so as long as they are at their posts.  \n\nIf these honorable civil servants are all removed in favor of replacing them with political hacks and unskilled inexperienced overconfident appointees and private sector contractors and concessioners and privatized operators, may God help us and have mercy on us all, even the replacements, because 'the markets' and our enemies will have none.  \n\nAnd our enemies, who are real and cheering for our self-inflicted demise, will celebrate if they get to witness the decline of the U.S. because we would not invest in infrastructure and cleaning up our own house and we let it become a run-down rodent and pest infested privatized franchised hazard to all who once dreamed it could be a place of true and sustainable prosperity with plenty of opportunity and prosperity and security for all who would call it home.  ",

The fact that older borrowers—many of whom are on a fixed income—were even at risk of losing their benefits due to default in the first place is absurd.\n\nThe government needs to do more than just stop taking from retirees; they need to address the root issue—why are so many borrowers, young and old, stuck in default?

She said he was possessed, but I knew the child suffered from something else - like a cluster of different disabilities and birth defects. The pastor said he would and asked me, a 16 year old, to interpret for the exorcism. I stopped believing in god in that very moment and refused to say what the pastor said. He was a mean man and I didn’t want him to know, so I just misinterpreted what he said, letting him talk, and then telling the woman that it wasn’t a demon or forces of evil, but issues for which she should see a doctor.

He described them as a lazy fish with very little muscle that tends to float around, often vertically in the water, eating various types of plankton.\n\nFascinating fish, and the example that washed up looked to be in excellent condition.\n\n>Oarfish, one of the ocean’s longest fish, are astonishing creatures that grow up to eight metres long. Nicknamed the “king of herrings” or more unkindly the “doomsday fish”, some legends and stories consider the animals to be harbingers of disaster.\n\nUh oh.",

So many of those students are going to end up on the streets and shelters cuz they have no where else to go. I saw it first hand during Covid when we had to close down the center. I had so many students crying and begging to stay cuz they had no where to go or had to go back to abusive homes. That was the worst week of my career. I cried myself to sleep every night knowing that many of the students would end up homeless and living on the streets. I loved my students and went above and beyond to help them. I knew almost every student by name and built up their trust. Students were comfortable reaching out to me when they were in crisis or struggling. My students came first. You fuck with my students you’re going to have to answer to me. \n\nJobcorps is a lifeline for many teens and young adults looking to escape poverty, get their education, and learn a trade. I honestly think job corps is one of the best government programs we have. I have watched so many students go from getting kicked out of every high school,living on the streets, and being gang members to turning their life around and become successful. It gives teens and young adults who can’t afford school to get their GED and learn a trade. This program helps so many youth escape poverty and make a life for themselves. I can’t express how sad, mad, and disappointed I am. I already had a feeling this administration was going to shut down jobcorps. I cannot even express how upset I am about this.

That home was burned down after over two years of threats from people in the area who repeatedly told us they would set it on fire. We reported these threats to law enforcement multiple times and nothing was done.\n\n>Throughout that time we were harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship. Much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\n\n>When we returned to the site to check our mail we discovered the skull of one of our dogs and its harness placed in clear view. This caused both of us severe emotional distress. We began yelling and crying in response to the pain of what we saw.\n\n>While we were doing this a man approached us. He started yelling violent homophobic slurs at us. He then raised a gun from his lap and fired.\n\n>Jonathan and I had no weapons. We were not threatening anyone. We were grieving. We were standing side by side. When the man fired Jonathan pushed me out of the way. He saved my life.\n\n>Jonathan is my husband. He gave me more love in our time together than most people ever get. We were newlyweds. We picked Valentines Day. We were in the process of looking for a trailer and planning our future.\n\n>He was murdered by someone who could not stand the sight of two men loving each other.\n\n>I was with him when he passed. I told him how much he was loved.\n\n>To everyone who supported him, his fans, his friends, know that he valued you deeply. He saw you as family.\n\n>My focus now is on protecting Jonathan’s legacy and honoring the life we built together.\n\n>If your concern is how someone coped with trauma or how loudly they speak when recounting injustice and being ignored by authorities then you never truly cared about my husband.\n\n>Jonathan saved my life. I will carry that forward. I will protect what he built.\n\n>\\- Tristan Kern de Gonzales\n\n  \nDon't know the guy, hadn't heard of him till this post but this is fucking tragic. Be better, people.\n\n\nedit: thank you for my first award :')",

The coach learned more details from the students Sunday, who said that upwards of **ten masked people, who appeared to be ICE agents, began questioning the three high schoolers and scanning their faces with cell phones on their way to practice.**\n\n>“These are high school students. They’re honors and AP level students. They are members of athletic teams. They are members of the student council. They are members of the school musical ensembles,” Mainini said.\n\n>Sunday morning, Milford families celebrated during the high school’s graduation ceremony.

Last year, archaeologists using AI discovered hundreds of new geoglyphs dating back more than 2,000 years, predating the famous lines in the sand.\n\n>“They are trying to rub out history,” said Ana María Cogorno Mendoza, president of the Maria Reiche International Association, a non-profit created to protect the Nazca Lines. “The area that is being separated is exactly where some of the oldest rituals took place, according to our research.” Maria Reiche was a German-born mathematician who pioneered research on the Nazca Lines in the 20th century. \n\n>Critics of the move say it will weaken decades of environmental protection and open up the Nazca Archaeological Reserve to informal and illegal mining, just as international gold prices peak.\n\n>Peru’s culture ministry, which decided on Friday to reduce the Nazca reserve from about 5,600 sq km to roughly 3,200 sq km, said the decision was the result of a 20-year study and consultation and did not affect the Unesco World Heritage destination or its buffer zone.\n\nIllegal mining is already a serious problem in the region and around the famous geoglyphs, and this will make it much worse. \n\nI always wanted to visit them since seeing them on an episode of [*In Search Of…*](https://youtu.be/rb_0zL_VtJg?si=2eER5y8C0teP1-v8) (alien aviators lol) as a kid.

As you're landing, you will sometimes see another plane flying close to you, going the same way. It kind of looks like a mirror as the plane comes closer to closer, then you both land. Pretty cool actually but you always assume that the air traffic controller is doing their thing. Combined with the fact that Oakland Airport is right across the bay and nearby, it's any wonder shit like this doesn't happen more often.",

If they can’t clean it up in a way that gives the bees time to find their own queens among the wreckage, almost all of them are doomed. And it’ll be a total loss for the farmers, pending insurance. California farmers need to find more bees or not get pollinated, Washington farmers need to replace the bees they’ve raised. Local region gets a bunch of stressed out honeybees with nowhere to go. It’ll take some really careful mitigation to recover it all, on top of handling the accident and the surrounding humanity. \n\nAlso, ridiculous that our farming infrastructure requires bee imports for pollination. How about boost the habitat around the farms and cut down on the monoculture crops? All the highways and stormwater ditches should be no-mow in the dry summer. Retain moisture in the vegetation and give a wildlife coordinator to connect habitat fragments and boost pollination. And save on public works maintenance costs. The problem for these bees is that there are no flowers most of the summer, and then a mega monoculture blooms and expects there to be billions of bees and butterflies to support it. But also here’s neurological pesticides like neonics to kill the “bad bugs.” You reap what you sow. ",

Then another... so we stopped at a gas station, popped the back open and the bees were bearding on the outside of one of the hives. LOTS of them. So, luckily we had our trusty suits with us and we put them on at the gas station, just as a fire truck pulls up. \n\n\"You alright?\" The fireman asks us. \n\n\"Yea, the bees just got out.\" I respond back. \n\n\"Oh.\" he pauses for a good 3 seconds..\"Good luck with that.\" he says, then he puts the fire truck in gear and drives out.\n\nI guess we looked silly (or sus) putting on beekeeping suits at a gas station, at midnight, in an urban area. Anyway, we then got back in the car, cranked the AC to max to keep the bees cool so that they don't get angy. In the end we succeeded in rehoming the hives without too much of an issue.

And Job Corps what they chance to break free. Some of them have been told they aren't welcome back home and are suddenly facing homelessness. They are just being sent to the closest airport to where they came from and then being left to their own devices.\n\nedit: just an addendum. We live 3 hours from the airport my son is going to be arriving at. There was no communication with us to make sure anyone would be able to be there to pick him up. He didn't find out until early evening, so he called me to tell me his flight time about 20 minutes before my offices closed for the weekend. Now I'm lucky that I have a job that I can take time off from with short notice to go pick him on Monday. But I've definitely had jobs in the past that would have refused to let me take time off with such short notice. \n\nCompare this to when he joined Job Corp and they took care of all the transportation. They picked him up from home and took him to the closest Job Corp facility and from there took him to the airport. How many of these kids are just being flown out, and even if their parents want to go get them, are not able to do so? Maybe they don't have a reliable vehicle, maybe they can't afford the trip, maybe they can't get time off from work. There are many reasons why they might not be able to drop everything and pick their child up with so little notice.",

So many of those students are going to end up on the streets and shelters cuz they have no where else to go. I saw it first hand during Covid when we had to close down the center. I had so many students crying and begging to stay cuz they had no where to go or had to go back to abusive homes. That was the worst week of my career. I cried myself to sleep every night knowing that many of the students would end up homeless and living on the streets. I loved my students and went above and beyond to help them. I knew almost every student by name and built up their trust. Students were comfortable reaching out to me when they were in crisis or struggling. \n\nJobcorps is a lifeline for many teens and young adults looking to escape poverty, get their education, and learn a trade. I honestly think job corps is one of the best government programs we have. I have watched so many students go from getting kicked out of every high school,living on the streets, and being gang members to turning their life around and become successful. It gives teens and young adults who can’t afford school to get their GED and learn a trade. This program helps so many youth escape poverty and make a life for themselves.

Their heads were severed and shipped to Leipzig University in Germany to be studied — a common practice at the time, as[ researchers](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/a-brief-history-of-the-enduring-phony-science-that-perpetuates-white-supremacy/2019/04/29/20e6aef0-5aeb-11e9-a00e-050dc7b82693_story.html) sought to confirm their unfounded theory that Black people’s brains were smaller than those of other races, therefore making them inferior.\n\n>“They were stripped of their dignity,” Guillory said, over “a practice rooted in racism and exploitation. They were people with names. They were people with stories and histories. Some of them had families, mothers, fathers, daughters, sons, human beings.” They were not specimens, she continued, “not numbers.”\n\n>The heads were returned to New Orleans about a week ago after a two-year journey, said Eva Baham, a retired Dillard professor. Representatives from Leipzig contacted the city in 2023 about their existence in Germany, where the university houses a skull collection dating to the 1800s. The school is in the process of repatriating or sending back skulls to their original locations. That initial call set in motion the creation of the Cultural Repatriation Committee, led by Baham.\n\n>“We are not talking about them as if they are skeletal remains,” Baham said at the news conference. “We want to honor them by calling them the individuals that they are.”\n\n>Dillard, one of two historically Black universities in New Orleans, along with Xavier University of Louisiana, welcomed the opportunity to be part of “this very sensitive acknowledgment of our people, that they are here,” Guillory told NBC News. A visitation will take place Saturday at Dillard’s Lawless Memorial Chapel with a service.\n\n>Laid to rest will be the remains of **Adam Grant, Isaak Bell, Hiram Smith, William Pierson, Henry Williams, John Brown, Hiram Malone, William Roberts, Alice Brown, Prescilla Hatchet, Marie Louise, Mahala, Samuel Prince, John Tolman, Henry Allen, Moses Willis and Henry Anderson.**\n\n>The two other people could not be identified.\n\nIt's all kinds of messed up that these people were cut up and their heads sent to Germany for eugenic cranial research, and just left there. And of course it was all done without permission.\n\nIt's 150 years after the fact, but at least they've finally been laid to rest and given some dignity back.",

It had dropped roughly 20% below the mark last month, when fears were at their worst about whether Trump’s trade war would drive the economy into a recession.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 60 points, or 0.1%, as of 9:35 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was 1.3% higher.\n\nThe gains were even bigger in Asia, where markets had the first chance to react to the ruling issued late on Wednesday by the U.S. Court of International Trade in New York. It said that the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act that Trump cited for ordering massive increases in taxes on imports worldwide does not authorize the use of tariffs.\n\n*The White House immediately appealed, and the long-term outcome of legal disputes over tariffs remains uncertain. The court’s ruling also affects only some of Trump’s tariffs, not those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos, which were invoked under a different law.*\n//",

Another said she worked for him from 2014 until 2020 and was assaulted at least 23 times. \n\nWhen I first heard about the rape allegations, the time line always bothered me. The first rape accusations were linked with allegations of poor pay, bad work conditions, and were secondary to the labor allegations. In fact the first reporting indicated that they hadn’t even filed a police complaint yet. At the time I thought if he was paying them less than minimum wages, why not just quit and find another job. I mean if they had a work history of 12 years working for one family how hard would it be to find another job. Again the sexual assault was secondary in the reporting and they weren’t pressing for criminal charges. Also if I recall correctly there were only two housekeepers at the time. Also it was hard to get a sense of when the rapes occurred. Was it 4 a year for the period between 2014-2020, or 2 a year for the period between 2012-2024 or did they all happen in 2019. A very confusing situation and as in most of these cases the reporting and reality may bear little relation to each other. So wait and see.",

With 4 victims, I feel like the police will be able to find any obvious inconsistencies in their stories.\n\nEven if you assume he is innocent, I'm never sure how I feel about the strategy of counter suing.

They thought it was quite comical. I don’t know whether they thought I was telling the truth or not,” she said.\n\n>“They kept telling me that I had too many clothes in my suitcase. So because of that, they assumed that I was going to overstay my visa,” she said.\n\n>Saroukos was subject to more screening. Her fingerprints and a DNA swab of her mouth were taken.\n\n>Meanwhile, her mother was free to go.\n\n>Saroukos said her heart sank when officials told her she would be declined entry to the U.S. and deported back to Australia the next day.\n\n>“[The officer] said ‘so basically what is going to happen is we’re going to send you to a prison overnight where you will stay,’” she said. “Not detention center, he said prison, and I automatically just, I started crying again.”\n\n>“Because when you think prison, you think, big time criminals. I don’t know who I’m being housed with,” she said.\n\n>According to Saroukos, border officials told her they would contact her husband on her behalf, but she found out later they didn’t.\n\n>Saroukos said officials conducted a body cavity search, walked her through the airport in handcuffs, and drove her to the Federal Detention Center.\n\n>“They stated, ‘No, you’re not under arrest. You haven’t done anything wrong, and you’ll be facing no criminal charges.’ So I was very confused as to why this was all happening,” she said.\n\n>At the prison, Saroukos was strip searched and detained with women who had been convicted of murder and drug offenses. She shared a cell with a woman from Fiji, who was also denied entry and waiting to be deported.\n\nJust, put yourself in her position for 10 seconds. You’ve done everything right. You’ve followed the laws and procedures. And just because someone decides today’s the day, they take you and your family, berate you, *rape* you, then parade you in front of the entire airport, and send you off to *prison* where you’re sexually harassed again. They cut you off from any means to contact anyone outside. They admit you’ve done no crime, they tell you this to your face. But they’ve kidnapped you, violated you, trampled your rights, and were one plane trip away from having you disappeared forever. Welcome to America.\n\nThis is fascism. This is what authoritarianism looks like. It’s not just happening to illegals or people you don’t like. It is everywhere. It is pervasive. It is growing. And it is not going away on its own.\n\n*It can happen to you.*",

Why is the family saying they need to “shut down” homeless encampments? The politicians listed supporting these policies are not offering support for the people who find themselves in these dire circumstances. They just want to destroy any amount of normalcy they’ve been able to find in the encampments. Finland has managed to eradicate homelessness. They’ve done so by providing homeless people with homes, support in finding jobs and support for mental health and addiction. Simply destroying camps addresses nothing. It will solve nothing. I feel for the family, but making everyone in already challenging situations lives harder is not going to help anyone.",

It's a problem you can throw huge sums of money and it doesn't really alleviate the problem nor change the societal direction of homelessness. It's not just people who lack economic resource. If it was *just* about money, we'd have it nailed by now. Mental illness and other disabilities make up a large portion of the homeless community. A lot of these people, constitutionally, cannot care for themselves. They aren't lazy. They aren't unmotivated. They suffer from conditions that, often, render them literally incapable of doing the most basic elements of self-care. We need a system entirely devoted to this totally vulnerable part of our population. These are people that need assistance and have no way of paying for that assistance. We must help them in an organized, society-wide way because it is both he moral thing to do *and* the most practical thing we could to help restore some order to how our streets function. Meeting the needs of the homeless disabled population is a win win. And once we figure out the best way of helping that part of the homeless population you can build institutions designed to uniquely address the needs of other groups of homeless people. For some, it's going to be to offer shelter and assistance while they pursue better employment. For others, it may mean help with alcoholism and/or addiction. There are paths forward for people. it is of distinct benefit to all of us to help manifest the successful transformation of their lives.",

He was part of a gang that killed 10 people in Chicago in 1972.\n\n>Ruben Taylor, 70, a member of the De Mau Mau gang that killed a Barrington Hills family in 1972. The gang randomly picked the home to rob. They forced Paul and Marion Corbett, their 22-year-old daughter and her aunt into a pantry. Their pet dachshund barked at the intruders, and a robber threw a knife at it. The daughter told him to stay away from the dog, and Taylor shot her in the chest. His brother Donald shot each of the other three family members in the head. Taylor was sentenced to 100 to 150 years. Asked by a parole board member how he'd respond to being called \"unrepentant,\" he answered, \"They don't know me and haven't walked in my shoes\" but also said, \"What can you say, other than you're sorry?\"\n> \n>The board granted Taylor parole by a vote of 8-4 in 2018.",

That was **after** they unloaded an entire can of pepper spray directly into his face. Less than a second later, they fired the taser.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n* Full can of pepper spray to the face\n\n* One pathetic baton swing that missed\n\n* Taser deployed within a second of the failed batton strike.\n\n* All of this  happened within 60 seconds of entering the room.\n\nThese police are panicked, undertrained cowards who shouldn't be trusted with a flashlight, let alone a badge, pepper spray, or a taser.\n\nThen in the article it says: \n\n>Smith previously told jurors he did not see that the pensioner was disabled and using a wheelchair until after the incident, as he was focused on the knife.\n\nSo not only are they beyond incompetent, they are apparently blind as well. Top-tier awareness from the people we trust with weapons.\n\nI guess the wheelchair just blended in perfectly with the wallpaper. Totally reasonable for a trained officer to miss the one object that literally defines someone as physically disabled /s\n\nIf they’re too unobservant to spot a mobility aid in plain sight, maybe policing isn’t the job for them. You shouldn’t be making split-second decisions with weapons if you can’t handle basic awareness. Pick a job where nobody dies when you screw up FFS. \n\n>Meanwhile, Comotto said she believed using the Taser was the safest way to \"protect\" Mr Burgess as she feared her colleague using the baton again would cause more harm.\n\nJesus Christ. Even if the baton had broken his arm, what kind of absolute dimwit thinks that blasting a 92-year-old with 50,000+ volts is somehow less harmful? You have to be terminally dense to believe electrocuting a frail elderly man is the safer option.",

This is not what many people in red states asked for- they were simply not listened to, and they will suffer the consequences regardless. (Additionally, the people affected the most are also the ones who are least likely to have the resources to leave even if they wanted to, so usually if you're just unlucky enough you're stuck between a rock and a hard place.)",

In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.

Elders say the land was blessed by Usen, their Creator, and inhabited by Ga’an, the mountain spirits or angels who provide spiritual succor and guidance to seekers.\n\n>It is also here that Resolution Copper Mining, a joint subsidiary of British and Australian mining giants, Rio Tinto and BHP, wants to remove layers of rock to extract copper from deep underground. The in-demand metal is used for electric vehicle and cell phone manufacturing. In the works for nearly a decade, the project has stalled amid a legal fight between U.S. agencies and those trying to protect Oak Flat on religious grounds.\n\n>Resolution Copper President Vicky Peacey said the mine will be a “massive investment in rural Arizona” — creating 3,700 jobs over the course of the project and boosting state and local tax revenues by $88 million to $113 million a year. The company continues to “seek dialogue, to come to a collaboration and partnership,” said Tyson Nansel, a company spokesperson. “We need the copper. The town and the tribe need jobs,” Nansel said.\n\n\nIn other words, “Fuck your religion, we want money.”",

Syed said his son couldn't help the woman \"because he didn't know if he was going to get shot himself.\"\n\nConnecticut State Police said troopers also responded to the incident, but directed any inquiries to the Waterbury Police Department.\n\nThis is a developing story and will be updated as information becomes available.\n\nReporters Andreas Yilma and Bruno Matarazzo contributed to this story.",

Mutants were the hot thing, no one wanted to write for Hulk, no one cared about a big green guy screaming \"Hulk smash!\" and that's about it. David took over, introduced Joe Fixit (a gray colored variation on the Hulk, harking back to his very first appearance where he was gray.) and suddenly had a sarcastic clever Hulk to write instead of the big green dummy.\n\nI thought Joe Fixit was cool as a shit as a kid, but missed the more traditional savage Hulk (after all, I hadn't seen decades of it yet, I'd only read savage Hulk stories in back issues I bought in the comic shop) so I was very excited when #372 brought him back. The merging was even cooler to me and the whole arc with the Pantheon was really good as well.\n\nPeter David was an amazing writer, his work meant so much to me as a kid, it was so good. He'll be missed. RIP.",

Josh Green at the Waikiki Yacht Club on Oahu, acknowledged he was nervous facing the crowd, which included reporters. Widger said he was feeling “really weird” — not seasick, but, “I just feel like I have to, like, hold on to things to not fall over.”\nHe became an online sensation with his story, which followed a diagnosis four years ago with a syndrome that carried a risk of paralysis and made him realize he disliked his managerial job. He quit his job with “no money, no plan” and $10,000 of debt — and the goal of buying a sailboat and sailing around the world. \n\nHe taught himself to sail mostly via YouTube and moved from Portland to the Oregon coast. He spent months refitting the $50,000 boat he bought.\n\nHe set sail for Hawaii with Phoenix in late April, documenting their experiences for his more than 1 million followers on TikTok and 1.7 million followers on Instagram. He said he thinks his story, which made national news, resonated with people. \n“I think a lot of people are, you know, you’re grinding at your job all day long and it doesn’t really matter how much money you make at this point, everybody’s just trying to do enough to get by and that just wears you out,” he said. “It’s just the world’s in a weird place, and I think people have seen that it’s possible to break.",

Barfield’s attorney in the case did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday.\n\n>Barfield opened fire while two elementary school-aged children were on board and, separately, while more than a dozen fishermen were on board boats he operated, prosecutors said.\n\n>He used poisoned bait even more prodigiously, they said.\n\n>\"Barfield fed an estimated 24–70 dolphins poison-laden baitfish on charter trips that he captained,\" NOAA Fisheries said in a separate statement Friday.\n\nHe was mad because the dolphins were doing a better job at catching the fish than his customers were. \n\nIt’s a light sentence considering how long he was doing this and how many dolphins he cruelly killed. He should really lose his boat because he has no business being in the boat charter business after this.",

        "body": "They tried this in the states a little while back and didn't accomplish much because Americans tend to try to shoot everything. I seem to recall several outages where they found bullet holes.\n\n\nDepartment of Energy data suggests suspicious energy grid disruptions are on the rise, especially in the Western U.S., historically a white supremacist stronghold. In reports filed to the DOE, power grid operators identified 200 instances of vandalism, suspicious activity, sabotage or physical attacks in 2023, comprising 58% of all reported incidents. (Other reports cited factors like severe weather, cyberattacks or equipment failures.) That represents a large increase over the last five years. In 2017, just 9.3% of reported disturbances noted suspicious circumstances, a number that rises to 20-to-30% from 2018 to 2021. Over the past decade, roughly half of these attacks happened in the West. \n\nThe FBI made arrests in three different white supremacist plots involving substations, all interrupted in 2020. In one case, three men who met through a neo-Nazi chat room planned to shoot up substations to take down the national energy grid. They were caught only because a man the group was recruiting lost his phone; the person who found it found Nazi propaganda on it and turned it over to the police. In the government’s sentencing memorandum for one of the men, prosecutors said they “planned to attack substations with powerful rifles that would penetrate the transformers” because they believed it would “cause confusion and unrest” and cost the government millions. “There was even discussion that their plan could succeed in producing a race war and the next Great Depression,” the memo says. All three pleaded guilty to one count of conspiring to provide material support to terrorists; one still awaits sentencing, and the other two are serving five- and seven-year prison terms.\n\nAnother three men were arrested at a Las Vegas Black Lives Matter protest with Molotov cocktails in their car, according to a Department of Justice statement. The government alleges that the men, who claimed to be members of the far-right “Boogaloo” movement, had also plotted to firebomb a substation. Two pled guilty and were sentenced to between four and 20 years, while a third received life in prison.\n\nThe FBI also charged four men in another 2020 plot that involved conspiring to destroy an energy facility, as well as stealing military gear to carry out the attack. Two of them pleaded guilty; the other two pleaded not guilty and are still awaiting trial. Court documents allege that two of the co-conspirators met online in a neo-Nazi forum and recruited others, and the group shared photos of themselves giving the Nazi “Sieg Heil” salute. In a detention hearing for one of the accused, Chris Little, a special agent for the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), testified that one of the men had compiled a list of assassination targets associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. Little testified that the person also handwrote a list of intersections in cities across the West, including Boise, Portland, Seattle and San Francisco. Every intersection contained energy infrastructure. \n\nThe men, Little testified, wanted to create an outage because it “diverts the police, causes chaos from the outage itself, causes damage to the equipment, takes a long time to replace and causes an outage of significant length.” They planned to use that chaos “to create a favorable operating environment to conduct an assassination.” In the far-right movement, this twisted logic falls under the banner of an ideology called “accelerationism”: the belief that accelerating the collapse of society will enable white people to take over and rebuild the world they want.",

His lawyer did everything he could to paint me in a negative light. It didn't work. My attacker received 50 years with 25 years suspended. The judge straight up told him, \"You're sorry to your wife. Your sorry to your kids.

He failed to complete his anger management classes. He went back to court for that. They dismissed the failure to comply. He kept the assault on his record. \n\nThe second assault, he was given 90 days in jail... with all the time suspended.\n\n\nJustice in this country is relative to where you live.

They literally sent her photos of her children and told her to do what they wanted and not tell police or something bad would happen to her kids. (One photo was of the son at school hanging out with friends, the other photo of the daughter taken from the window of her apartment at college a state away). \n\nFinally did what they wanted and some time after was contacted by the FBI who was investigating this group and noticed some activity from her end. She was fully cooperative and helped every step of the way. But because she helped steal millions of dollars she was still hooked on charges. Even though it was plain as day to everyone she was a victim (even the prosecution and FBI agents that worked on the case thought she shouldn’t have faced any punishment), the judge wanted to “set an example” for what happens if you steal pocket change from billionaires, and the press went to town vilifying her while the bank she worked at for 20 years threw her under the bus completely.",

You caught up to me when you did because I was going 30mph slower.\"\n\nHe wouldn't admit I was right, but said because I didn't give him a \"hard time\" that he was going to let me go with a warning... but that next time I wouldn't get off so easy.\n\nThat whole situation made me start to think about how often cops pull over the wrong person.",

She most likely had her live ammo on the cart for that later break. That was the first mistake. The second mistake was when the 1st A.D. grabbed a gun from the cart without consulting Gutierrez-Reed. The third mistake was when Baldwin accepted it without asking for a demo that it was safe.\n\nActually, the first mistake was cheaping out and hiring a reckless rookie like Gutierrez-Reed in the first place. A better, more experienced armorer was approached first, but he turned it down because he knew the job wouldn’t be safe within their tight budget.",

Also, the different subfields that a given department is strong in matter as well. \n\nDon’t worry though, it doesn’t matter that much. I had a professor who went to some tiny school with a 99% acceptance rate, who went to MIT for his PhD.\n\nAt this point, start focusing on undergrad. Look into the different subfields, and if you’ve already chosen a school, research the professors at the school and make a list of those you would be interested in working with.\n\nAll in all, if you do the following you will be just fine (ie get into top schools for grad school), even if you go to a no name undergrad program:\n\n- get straight As in your classes, and take math and physics courses\n- look into REUs and internships at National labs\n- contact professors for research and don’t give up until you find something\n- put a lot of effort into research; ideally go to a conference before grad school applications, so that you can meet professors and grad students from other schools, or maybe even publish a paper\n \nA personal piece of advice is that you should put a lot of time and effort into searching for research opportunities. Make sure you devote a lot of time to that, maybe even sacrificing some studying for that as nowadays research is incredibly important for graduate school admissions.",

They should be in one lab book (and another when you run out of room), everything should be dated, write context with the numbers, and write the order of operations that you utilized whether it be wiring, code, analyisis, electronics testing, or whatever you may be doing. Theres a few reasons why... 1) All of your research needs to be reproducible by another person; this likely won't happen, but, in theory, someone should be able to reproduce your results with the aide of your lab book. 2) You may have to revisit that activity in a few years or at least convey that information to another person. 3) In 4-6 years (or sooner if you publish) you'll be writing your dissertation and you'll need those notes to remind yourself how or why you did something. \n\nI can't tell you how much time I've wasted trying to recreate the wheel I already created because I didnt document properly.

Ask questions, answer questions, go to talks by visiting speakers, go to office hours, etc. During office hours ask your profs if they have any research you can get into. \n\nIf you can't find an opportunity at your home university you can apply for an REU (Research Experience for Undergrads). REUs are highly competitive to get into but they are meant for students who can't get research experience at their home university. If you're accepted, you'll spend the summer at a host university doing research; travel, food, housing, and a stipend are funded by the NSF. Note: REUs (like grad school apps) require 1-2 letters of recommendation; so again, be an engaged student and develop relationships with your profs because you'll need those letters. \n\nAnd you can also look into summer school type opportunities like this one...\n\nhttps://frib.msu.edu/education-and-training/undergraduate-students/ns3\n\nPrograms like that week long summer school help you get familiar with a topic (nuclear physics in this case) and could lead to further opportunities later. \n\nI did NS3 then was accepted for an REU the next summer at that university.

Matlab should come pretty easily after that if your uni teaches it on top of python.

Both are kinda just necessary knowledge for all physics phenomenon. At your current level I'd recommend not going beyond the ideas of lagrangians and hamiltonians in classical mechanics, and  for quantum mechanics the introduction of the schrodinger equation until university so as not to get overwhelmed. You don't need to know it inside and out but its just useful to familiarise yourself with them and the concepts and will give you a sizeable step up over your peers.\n\nOther useful things is for electromagnetism, familiarising yourself with gauss' law and the simplified amperes law, answering some basic questions on it aswell, theres very good youtube videos you can easily find on them. The hardest thing about my first year was just figuring out how the equations worked.\n\nI cannot comment on astro or particle physics, im a theoretical physics student specialising in condensed matter physics and haven't got enough on those two to say anything.",

Also, the newest edition is available on libgen. Read the problem guide at the start of the book, because all the end of chapter problems are organised by what they test you on, so you can study more effectively by choosing problems that you are weaker on. The order of chapters I would go in would be this:\n\nFor classical mechanics, I would do all of part one, in order, skip chapter 14 on fluid mechanics, and do part 2. You're welcome to study fluid mech if you want, but most classical mechanics classes don't cover it. Also, don't get intimidated by how many chapters are in part 1. Its pretty intuitive stuff, the authors just want to make sure you get a good foundational understanding so there's a lot more writing than strictly necessary.\n\nFor E&M, I would study part 4, in order, and skim part 5. If you are interested in modern physics, I would read chapter 34 and 36, since light's particle-wave nature will come up again in part 6\n\nsome physics labs can be pretty boring, but a lot of them can be fun and genuinely contribute to understanding, so don't force yourself to do all the labs you find online just because they show up a lot or are included in something you read. Plus, you may not have all the materials. I remember a lot of high school physics was timers and oscillators, and averaging out loads of data ;-;\n\nThe memorable ones from my highschool physics class were building circuits, and messing with [weird torsion stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5bKzBZ7XuM).\n\nETA: If you shared some more info on what level of math you're at, what areas within physics excite you most, we might be able to offer more specific advice. A lot of the advice so far has been about self studying to be at the same level as students who have taken calculus based physics classes, but that might not be what you want/need.\n\nAlso, IDK if I would do all the intense studying people are suggesting, by mastering all of an undergraduate physicist's course load, reading giant textbooks front to back, and also learning programming while not having basic physics down. It's going to be really hard to stay motivated if you drive yourself that hard, so try to set reasonable expectations but stick to them. The textbook chapters I mentioned above were what two semester classes covered, at an AP level over the course of 10 months. Squeezing it into 2 (I'm assuming you're studying over the summer) is going to be tough, but doable.",

I thought I'd do HEP research but I am into cm/solid state/ PDEs instead. My interests did not change, but I realized that there are many of the things I found interesting in HEP in cm and the other fields. It certainly does not hurt that there is so many more options for schools in cm. G wave research is just so niche that trying to pigeonhole yourself right now into it is ill-advised. I'd say shop around especially in better funded fields like plasma, and talk to your advisor about your interests. Maybe you can do something later on in g waves if the opportunity arises.

In that case, modern HEP-theory papers are often less cited, since, well, most of the breakthroughs were already laid out a few decades ago (oops) and even those took some time to gather traction…   Good science takes time… \n\nIn my opinion, I think condensed matter and adjacent subfields have more promise on delivering new/novel stuff  than HEP. Yes, you can come up with 10 new particles in paper by literally making field transformations to Lagrangians, but there are already more than twice that amount of hypothetical particles people already came up with, and, as of now, beyond any verifiability options. \n\nAt the end of the day, you should choose whatever drives your passion, but do not base those choices on citations or popularity.

If you are tempted to do a PhD in a field you \\_aren't\\_ interested in to hedge your bets career-wise, you should reconsider whether you should do a PhD at all or just go for an industry job. It's an easier and more lucrative path.\n\nBut, assuming you find condensed matter genuinely interesting and are not only picking it for career reasons, as a former particle/gravitational-wave cosmologist who is now in data science, I would recommend condensed matter. There are a lot of interesting problems about predicting properties of matter from microscopic properties that are very relevant for the modern world and involve some deep theory. HEP has been stuck for a decade or more because it has become prohibitively expensive to do the experiments needed to push the boundaries of the energy frontier, and the funding situation is not exactly getting better. You can learn about the standard model \"recreationally\" without doing research in it.",

If it was math that was maybe simpler, becouse you have the difference between deduction and induction and absurd, and I believe it’s pacifically chooseble the deduction over the induction over the absurd. \nBut what of this in physic? There always is a demonstration more mathematical, another more practical and intuitive, another more theoretical, another which uses less math understanding…\nFor example sometime ago in Special Relativity I found a demonstration which only used the constant speed of c, but it was such a very complicate one, while if you took a glance of the transformation graph it would appear trivial… but you need to know the transformation graph. What’s the best? \n\nDo you plan of an upvote system for the different proofs?\n(I was unable to explore the platform since I’m using a tablet)\n\nP.s. I’d love to be a contributor there",

Even in grad school and beyond, I don't think you generally need a beefy laptop to do research, it's more for email, writing documents, accessing and reading papers, and (if you do something with heavy computation) logging into a  cluster.\n\nMy personal experience was that having a unix-based terminal was very useful, since a lot of academic computing is done with a linux operating system so it's easier to find instructions for installation and things like that.

The difference between mathematics and physics is that physicists are constrained by the universe, mathematicians are not. This of course means that the intuition of a mathematician won’t be the same as the intuition of a physicist. Physicists are specifically trained to see physical dynamics in the mathematics. \n\nTheoretical physics is best understood not as “applied math”, but as a mathematically informed selection principle on the space of all mathematical structures, guided by physical intuition, constrained by correspondence to nature, but otherwise as rigorous and abstract as any pure math. It is a kind of “open subset” of mathematics in this interpretive sense. Comparing a theoretical physicist to a pure mathematician is like comparing someone who does mainly combinatorics or number theory with someone who mainly does geometry or algebra. They are focused on different kinds of structures, and their intuitions differ. \n\nTheoretical physics isn’t empirical science in the traditional sense. It’s proto-scientific mathematics: it proposes formal structures that, if connected to measurement, may become science. But it is mathematics first, science second.",

Unfortunately, the real important bits were the things the person was saying out loud or to themselves in choosing what to write.\n2. Students get almost no structured or assessed practice in conceptual physics thinking so it's not super surprising that they latch onto the math side. Physics is a collection of **laws** about the universe. These manifest both as ideas (inertia is a property of an object to resist changes to its motion) and mathematics (F=ma). They've likely never had to think this way before.

He once read me an excerpt from a nineteenth- century volume describing the raising of pigs trained to find truffles. It was a nice passage, telling, in an elevated style typical of that age, how man’s reason made use— in keeping with its mission— of the avid gluttony of the swine, to whom acorns were tossed each time they unearthed a truffle.\n>\n>This kind of rational husbandry, in Rappaport’s opinion, was what awaited the scientists; it was in fact already being put into practice in our own case. He made me this prediction in all seriousness. The wholesale dealer takes no interest in the inner life of the trained pig that runs about for the truffles; all that exists for him are the results of the pig’s activity, and it is no different between us and our authorities.\n>\n>The rational husbandry of scientists admittedly has been hindered by relics of tradition, those unthinking sentiments that came out of the French Revolution, but there is reason to hope that this is a passing phase. Besides the well- equipped sties— that is to say, the shining laboratories— other installa-tions should be provided, to deliver us from any possible feeling of frustration. For example, a science worker might satisfy his instincts of aggression in a hall filled with mannequins of gen-erals and other high officials specially designed for beating; or he could go to specific spots for release of sexual energy, etc. \nAvailing himself appropriately of outlets here and there, the scientist- pig— explained Rappaport— can then, without further distraction, devote himself to the hunting of truffles, for the benefit of the rulers but to the undoing of humanity, as indeed the new stage in history will demand of him.\n\nI think that this passage from Stanislaw Lem's \"His master's voice\" sums up very well a huge problem inside the world of physics. Personally, I believe the lack of courses in philosophy and critical thinking in science faculties is the main reason of why so many scientists only focus on what they are studying and ignore the consequences their research may have",

Graduate school (at least in physics and Astro) is harder to get into with each passing year. For better or worse, the GRE is being phased out of many applications - as in many of the schools I applied to wouldn't even *accept* GRE scores. This means GPA is pulling more weight than in years prior. If grad school is really what you want, you need to focus hard on research and get some good letters of rec. It is possible - a friend of mine was in a similar situation and made it. But he worked *hard*. Like 12-16 hour days are the norm kind of hard. It's worth noting that this is particularly helpful in experimental and observational fields. Theory is harder to have a lot of research in at the undergrad level and also imo is going to care more about your physics course grades. My advice: get your list of grad schools together and see if they accept the GRE. If your suffering grades are in physics, I would consider going that route. If your suffering grades aren't in physics, all in on research and networking. Ideally try and apply to places and to research groups that your references are already familiar with. And in general, email the professors you're looking at. Grad school (at many schools) is more like applying for a job than it seems. If the professors you mention in your statements aren't hiring, you're probably not getting in regardless.\n\nBy \"over\" you mean career: No. You'll be fine. If you put in the work to building your resume for the kind of work you want to do and are smart about where you apply to work, your gpa shouldn't be that big of a deal.",

If you multiply V by the charge of the electron (which is negative!!) then you get the potential energy U as a function of x.\n\nSo the potential energy function U(x) gets flipped across the x axis and the point x=100nm becomes a minimum. Hence it oscillates about that point (think back to turning points in energy diagrams).\n\nEdit: Another way to think about it is that the negative gradient of V gives the electric field, and multiplying that by the charge of the electron (which is negative) gives the force. So the gradient of the V graph is proportional to the force and hence the acceleration. At x=150nm the gradient is negative, and so it accelerates to the left, until it stops at 50nm, where the gradient of V is now positive so it accelerates to the right. It then keeps oscillating about x=100nm.",

If you don't know something, don't pretend to know it. It will not do yourself any favors. To someone who is an expert, it's easy to tell when someone does or doesn't know something.\n3. Document your sources. If you find a text, paper, or YT video that helps you understand something, write it down. You'll want to review it again in the future.\n4.

Second, I can almost guarantee that what your professor did was go through their email and find a list of papers that they sent their grad students on day one and then forwarded it to you.  You're a freshman so that means you by definition know absolutely nothing about anything, let alone their field of research - that puts you in the same place as a first year graduate student, except you know less, think you know more, and haven't learned anything about how to learn in university.  That's the exercise before you.  Don't fool yourself into thinking there are any expectations on you beyond that.\n\nSecond of all, understand that reading academic work is very much a learned skill and one that nothing has really prepared you for, because it isn't read the same way as other stuff is.  It isn't meant to be read linearly or even only once.  It almost certainly assumes you have a significant degree of experience reading current research in the field, that you are familiar with their own work, and are probably a contributor in your own right.  None of which are true about you.  For each paper, do the following (maybe 30 minutes a paper):\n\n\\- Read the abstract and note what their summary of their own work is (it's going to be light years better than an AI slop that Gemini throws at you).\n\n\\- Skip to the very end and note what their conclusion was.   I read papers backwards.  Abstract -> Summary -> Discussion -> Methods -> Background.  If I make it that far - if someone's work is beyond what you understand or can wrap your mind around, feel free to table it for now.\n\n\\- If the abstract and summary don't make any sense to you, then read them a few times, make a list of questions, and then go read the background section to see if the authors have tried to explain what particular problem they were trying to solve or what incremental piece of information they were hunting for.  That's all you're trying to understand at this point.  If you're still stuck and are completely baffled by what you're reading, put that paper aside.  If you think you have a general idea of what the paper is about, put it in a different stack.\n\nNow, you've got two piles - one which a half hour of time was unable to convey the basic idea of what it was about and the other a stack that was.\n\n\\- For each of the papers in the baffling stack, note the title and authors, and then collect your questions underneath it.\n\n\\- For each of the papers in the non-baffling stack, go back and start at the beginning and read them again, starting with the abstract and background sections (how does this specific work tie into the current state of the field?), then to methods (what did they do?), into results and discussion (what were their principal observations?).  Read their summary again to see what they themselves thought their primary takeaway was.  All the while, take your questions - and you should have a pile of them - and then synthesize those into specific but broad questions about the field (quantum information and such) that you can go armed with to meet with your professor.\n\nAs I mentioned, you are a freshman, which means you know nothing - so your task is to be a sponge.  You have an infinite amount of information, certainly more than you can get to as a freshman.  Your task is to use your professor to guide you towards an understanding of the field.  Most importantly, you should be trying to answer the question, \"Do I want to do academic research a) in this field after I graduate and b) with this particular professor?\"  That's it.  That's all.  Anything else you do with this professor and their graduate students should be in service of those two goals.  Nothing else.",

As many others have said, options ranging from engineering to accounting to med school are all viable. To give you an idea, in my graduating class, we had people go on to dentistry, economics, aerospace engineering, military, observatory staff, and of course myself and others into physics grad school. Let's say you continue into physics grad school, that still doesn't lock you in to academia or even physics. Many hedge funds exclusively recruit from physics PhD programs as an example. One of the biggest reasons why I'm still in physics is because I know that even if I end up hating something about my research, I know it won't be a waste of time.\n\nNow, as far as *should* you stay in physics, that entirely depends on a few things to do some introspection about:\n\nDepending on your program and how much you fill your schedule, you may have really long days and weekends you have to work. That's not to ask if you're a hard worker, but more so if you're willing to do more than a 40 hour week often. \n\nBesides the load, another thing to ask yourself is do you like the motivation of physics? As an oversimplification: An engineer uses math to *create* things and solve *practical* problems. A physicist uses math to figure out *why* things work. A mathematician investigates how the math *itself* works. If building things is more your jam, you may want to look at engineering. If you want to learn about how the world works more fundamentally, stay in physics. If you're good at math and the math itself is what you think is fascinating, you may consider switching to mathematics.\n\nIf none of those things call to you, what I would at least suggest you consider is if you can stomach the material of a physics degree. Unfortunately, while experimental physics is very common and important, most of your exposure will be to theory. You'll learn classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics/thermodynamics, and electrodynamics. At least in my experience, your only \"lab\" exposure will be in your intro courses, a couple of dedicated advanced laboratory courses, and maybe research. It won't be a very hands on degree. This is part of why some of my friends, despite loving physics, struggled to thrive. They wanted to do laser optics, plasma experiments, and superconductors, but unfortunately you don't get much direct exposure to those things as an undergrad unless you do research on them.\n\nSorry for the long winded response, but this is a question my friends and I have asked ourselves and I wanted to try and help :)",

Coding, for many, is learned outside of coursework despite being pretty essential to the field. There are, however, lots of online resources such as: FreeCodeCamp.org, Coursera, Udemy, Edx, WolframU, IBM has a learning platform, MITx and MIT Coursework. \n\nEngineering is a good major, too, if you want a greater assurance of getting a job. You not only learn to understand physical systems, but you will also apply physics in a direct money-making manner. \n\nIts a good idea to check out some current job posting to see what skills they are looking for. That way, you can decide what you want to learn and which major will be best for you. Also, talking to your professors, seniors, and alumni will help you envision what type of life you see for yourself and what type of work you want to do.\n\nOrganizations like Engineers Without Borders and the American Physical Society are worth checking out as well.",

        "body": "Let me tell you my story. It’s a bit long, please bear with me.\n\nI'm from Taiwan. Just to give you a little background in case you’re not familiar with our education system: we go through 3 years of junior high and 3 years of senior high. By the end of the first year of senior high, we have to pick between STEM (sciences, math, medicine) and non-STEM (arts, business, languages, etc.). STEM students take advanced subjects like calculus and AP-level physics, while non-STEM students stick with basic science and focus more on English, Chinese literature, history, and laws. At the end of high school, everyone takes a national university entrance exam, and your scores determine what programs you can get into.\n\nI chose STEM because I thought physics was the coolest subject ever. I watched tons of science outreach videos and found black holes, stars, quantum superposition and entanglement fascinating. But here’s the thing: my math sucked. Like, SUCKED. In those three years, I only passed math exams twice, out of probably a  hundred. My entrance exam math score was even lower than the average non-STEM student. It was so bad I couldn’t get into any STEM program in Taiwan. Everyone around me kept saying physics requires good math, so there was no way I could survive it. I guessed they were right.\n\nI had no choice but to give up on physics. Tbh I thought it was fine. Maybe I was just too dumb for science. Maybe it just wasn’t meant for me.\n\nEventually, I chose to major in German at a university in Taiwan, for no solid reason. I figured, hey, a lot of legendary physicists were German, so maybe speaking German would somehow bring me closer to being a physicist (it won't). I picked up German pretty fast. I even started thinking maybe I was just better suited for non-STEM.\n\nPhysics became a hobby. I stopped dreaming about being a scientist and watched sci-fi movies instead.\n\nThen, after one semester, my parents made a bold move, which changed the path of my life. They wanted me to study abroad while I was still young. Of course, I knew that wasn’t the real reason. The real reason was that a relative had graduated from a prestigious overseas university, and my Asian parents wanted to prove their kids could be just as impressive.\n\nLong story short, I ended up in Canada. And suddenly, I had a second chance to choose my major again. I decided to try physics this time, if possible at all. Friends, teachers, family back in Taiwan warned me against it. “Physics is hard. It’s for smart people!” And predictably, my high school grades still haunted me.\n\nMy academic record wasn’t good enough for any university STEM program. The only path forward was community college: boost my GPA, and maybe transfer to a university.\n\nI got conditionally accepted. But I had to restart from the very basics. Relearn trigonometry, solving for x, polynomials, speed and velocity, and projectile motion.\n\nBeing an international student is EXPENSIVE. And my parents never forget to remind me of that. So I studied like hell. No social life. No entertainment. No holidays. Just study, like you don't deserve a normal life.\n\nI had recurring nightmares about failing math exams. I'd wake up at 4 a.m. and just start studying again.\n\nEventually, I became that straight-A “genius” Asian kid every classroom has. I kept a high GPA, and people started calling me “smart.” I applied to a university in my second year and got into a physics program. When I got the offer, it felt like a dream come true. “I guess I am a physicist now!”\n\nBut I never forgot how dumb I used to be. That high school failure still lingers in the back of my mind. I still think I’m dumb from time to time. It is only when learning physics that I felt less dumb. I love physics so much.\n\nIn my third year, I decided to join a research group. I wanted to have some researching experience like some of my peers. I had always secretly dreamed of becoming a theoretical physicist, but “I suck at math,” right? So I thought I'd be realistic and look into experimental groups (no offense to experimentalists, I was ignorant).\n\nI browsed the department’s faculty page to find a group that interested me. But honestly, I didn’t even understand the research titles. Spontaneous symmetry breaking. Nonlinear optics. Gauge field theory. What even are those?\n\nIn the end, I picked quantum information science. The prof looked friendly, and quantum information \"science\" sounded like a general science subject I might survive.\n\nI started attending their group meetings, hoping to learn something. But I was clueless. Everything went over my head. It was so math-heavy.\n\nAfter a few meetings, I finally asked, “Where’s our lab? Why are we always talking about theories?”\n\n“We’re theorists.”\n\nAnd that’s basically how I ended up becoming a theoretical physicist. I hope it’s uplifting. I started with grades lower than non-STEM students. I was a German major. I spent a year relearning high school science. And somehow, I became the kind of theorist I dreamed of being back in high school. I still have nightmares about failing exams. Exams are hard but beatable.\n\nStudying physics and math isn’t really about being smart. I believe anyone can do physics. As long as you have passion. It’s all about commitment. Just do it, and study hard.\n\nPeople have been asking me  how I study for physics and math exams. I usually just say, \"Have you tried studying your ass off?\"",

Learn to build the hard things, and do it from scratch if you end up wanting a career in computational physics of some sort))\n\ngood luck\n\n  \nedit:  I see you are planning to go as far as the MSc.  I just want to tell you that outside of \"ad company CS\" (e.g. FAANG type CS career with no physics, or maybe ML or informatics) -- for having a career doing physics itself, the PhD will open so many more doors.",

I ended up having excellent grades and research experience and do not regret at all!!! I love it so deeply and can’t see myself anywhere else! It also comes with a sense of achievement, as I never thought when I was 16 to 19 years old that I could ever end up in a physics related major (even engineering ), let alone be decent at it. When I was in hs/college, I had pretty good grades in math and shitty grades a physics (like real shitty, all the time). Though I had very good grades in math when putting the work, I was extremely scared when walking in to an exam. It felt like if I don’t study, my grade is gonna be awful for sure , and I do study, my grade is gonna be randomly ranging from like 60 to a 100 lol. If you have good grades in math from my very subjective and personal experience it’s a good sign you can continue. Being scared before starting is a good sign, it means you’re not delusional about what’s waiting for you. As a tutor, I can say from experience (with many) that going in super confident and convinced you’re gonna ace everything this year is often a bad sign. So yeah, that being said, make sure you understand that you’ll have to work a lot and listen to your curiosity to fill in potential gaps in your knowledge and build your mathematical intuition (since you’re telling us you get bad grades in physics).",

Physics has always been a loved subject at heart but brain just can't comprehend studying physics. It feels as if though studying physics for an academic career is too risky and too unrealistic goals. \n\nI know i'll have to work hard to keep family afloat, but physics just doesn't feel worth it monetarily. Studying Bsc. with a major in Physics is the only option here in my country to pursue physics academically but still there is no career here, either i'll have to move abroad after bsc or i'll get stuck here with a physics degree doing jobs nowhere related to physics. I heartly want to study physics but i am having a hard time beleiving it will be worth it.\n\nHigher studies in physics has always been a dream for me but financially i can't accept it. Either i have to just fuck it all and go all in for physics without concerning for money or do something else which guarantees financial security. Heart says dive in head first, but mind can't gather enough courage to do so.\n\nAnyways, i hope you make the right choice and pursue your dreams regardless.",

It makes it a bit easier to manage a whole bunch of papers which would otherwise be tossed everywhere. \n\n However, it can be very difficult when it comes to doing coding (I had labs where I had to use Jupyter lab). I think the workaround is using Google collab and running Jupyter on n there.  For this situation I use my laptop. Similarly it's nice for being able to type papers and/or typing my analysis of a document. \n\nI personally have both, each serve a different purpose; I have an iPad which cost around $400 (and lasted me for 4.5 years, I probably would have been fine having it longer I just didn't want to deal with it having a terrible battery life... since I forget to charge it a lot). Having an iPad has been very convinent.  I also have a Lenovo IdeaPad, although I wish I got a thinkPad instead.or a Microsoft surface. You can get away with not having the top laptop, just as long as it can run code well enough. \n\nIf you have to pick one, then I would suggest looking at your curriculum and seeing how code intensive your program is, then decide from there, they each have their pros and cons. Having a computer is more of a necessity than a tablet but both still work, especially if you get a tablet with a keyboard, and can somehow run code on it. :)",

If you apply to grad school, writing about what research you're good at and why is probably the most important thing to put on your statement of purpose. In categorizing research, the day-to-day work (in the lab vs writing your own code vs using existing software vs doing math etc) is a more useful categorization than subject matter for this purpose.\n\nAfter trying out a few groups that do different kinds of work and you don't fit well with any of them, then that either means (1) you're gotten unlucky and you haven't found your research fit yet (or maybe none of your PIs were good at advising undergrads), or (2) no research fits you. If you're the first type, then that's a difficult situation, but I suspect not uncommon. If you generally find fulfillment in difficult long-term problem-solving, then keep going. If you come to be sure you're the second type, then don't go to grad school and do something else instead.\n\nClasses exist to make you learn what you need for research, ostensibly (IMO we're too stuck in tradition with coursework requirements). They're probably not a good gauge for whether you're fit for research, since they don't involve long-term difficult problem solving. They might be an OK gauge for seeing whether you'll like theory or experiment.

That means that you should probably elaborate on what you mean by grades, undergrad grades to get into masters or masters grades to get into PhD?\n\nIf it is the former : There are some big differences in grading and inflation/deflation when it comes to EU and USA. I remember seeing US students on the Internet freak out about having \"only 3.2GPA\" and stuff like that, meanwhile here is northern Europe a 3.2 ( which would translate to 8/10 which is the scale used where im from) would put you  in the top 5% for mathematics / physics majors. \n\nI have seen some (fairly competitive) masters programs even drop the qualifying exam part of the application if you have a 8/10 or higher. So, assuming there is nothing disasterous about your application like a very bad lor (which would be highly unusual of course) or a wreck of a personal statement then I'd say anything above a 7.5 from a European University (adjust for US inflation ) would be pretty great. I've even known people with 7.0 or even a bit lower make into some extremely competitive programs and do amazing work. For the masters programs at my department ( which isn't the most competitive but still has standards ) anyone above 7.0 is pretty much an automatic admition\n\nIf it is the latter, honest answer is grades won't matter much. Sure, having average grades or less would raise some flags but having done a strong thesis and gotten a good recommendation from your advisor is much more important than your grade in random class that's probably irrelevant to your PhD subject.",

I kinda \"fell into\" nursing, and we differ slightly in that I always wanted to study physics and wanted to be a physicist but [insert story of being a working class woman and not having the access or support] and I am very keen to work in the field one day.\n\nI started my part-time BSc Physics in Sept 2023. And I love it!!! Best decision I ever made. It has made me more patient and better at problem solving, more numerate and more curious about the world. \n\nThere are a few questions you need to ask yourself:\n\n1. Are you ready for the maths? If you're not currently highly numerate, are you ready to learn to be? \nI couldn't rearrange an equation when I started. Now I'm doing integration, solving differential equations and diagonalising matrices etc in my sleep! Physics is maths, maths is physics. Be prepared to learn a lot of maths. If you don't want to do that and are purely interested in the concepts, have a think about what it is you actually want from the physics degree. You might also want to consider doing your physics A level if you're in the UK. Are you just interested in space? If so, maybe astronomy and planetary science BSc is the way to go. \n\n2. Do you have the time? If you're not already studying a high level of maths, it is time consuming and it is hard to learn this as a full-time working adult. It's NOT impossible! But you'll need that dedication and drive and consistency. \n\n3. Are you willing to sink that amount of money into a hobby? For me, I really want to work in physics and so the money and time is worth it. It's all I want. If you're only wanting to persue as a hobby, as I said before why don't you look at doing your physics A-level (or if you're not in UK, your countries equivalent) - my physics A level gave me a really good understanding on physical concepts from quantum to astro to mechanics without dropping 5 figs on a degree.\n\nAre you in a position when you can just give it a go, test the waters and drop out if you want? Absolutely nothing wrong with giving it a go. Anyone can do anything if they have the right dedication (and unfortunately, finances lol) \n\nI'm so passionate about people pursuing physics from other fields, so message me if you want to discuss it more!",

        "body": "To me, there are some red flags in your answer that what you are feeling is something like \"the grass is always greener,\" rather than a good reason to switch majors.\n\nThis is a bit of a tough love answer... sorry, but I think it might help you to get an external perspective.\n\nSome things in your answer that worry me:\n\n>I didn’t have enough time to learn the new material properly, and I was constantly behind.\n\nMath and physics both require a significant investment in time to learn well. Switching to math will not fix this problem.\n\n>It became a kind of snowball effect: since I didn’t fully understand past topics, I struggled even more with the new ones that built on them.\n\nMath and physics are both cumulative subjects, so you will find the same snowball effect in math if you switch to that major and don't keep up with the work.\n\n>I would skip classes to catch up on older material, but that just made me fall even further behind on what we were currently doing. Our exams came every two weeks, and I felt stuck in a loop where I had to relearn everything for the next test, usually by cramming the night before.\n\nTo me, this sounds like you need to address your study habits. Skipping classes to catch up on older material is a self-defeating strategy. If you need to spend time catching up on older material, then you need to do that at a time when new material isn't being presented, otherwise you are only increasing the amount of material you need to catch up on.\n\nIt isn't easy to keep up with the work of a math or physics degree. But it is possible to do it without cramming the night before -- in fact, I would say that cramming is basically never effective and it's a very clear sign that you need to change things if you find yourself regularly doing it.\n\nMy recommendation would be to look for on campus resources for time management, and possibly for mental health. You should be attending all lectures, reviewing the lecture notes from lectures you attended before the next lecture, and starting the homework as soon as it is released. If you know you have an exam in two weeks, you should plan to spend time studying regularly before the exam.\n\n>I loved it so much that I started attending a course meant only for math majors: \"Logic and Set Theory\" even though I wasn’t officially enrolled. I went just for the joy of it, and I loved it even more. I didn’t take exams or submit assignments, but being in that classroom felt like I had found something special.\n\nIf you didn't do the homework and take the exams, then you can't really evaluate if you loved the course. You might have been \\*entertained by the lectures\\*, but to actually complete a degree you need to do the work of going through problems and proving your knowledge on exams.\n\nI do think the fact that you attended the lectures for fun is a sign that you find the material interesting, and that is a good reason to do math. But I don't think this course is strong evidence that you will like a math major more than a physics major.\n\nSimilarly, linear algebra and vector calculus are both great, but they are not the meat and potatoes of what you will be doing in a math degree.\n\nThe core foundational courses you will take are proof-based real analysis and abstract algebra. There will be lots of other courses too, but those are the central trunk from which most of everything else is built. If you want to switch to math, you should take one of those courses first, or at least get a copy of the books used for those courses and try to read them and do some of the problems. You should also try talking to some of the math professors at your university.\n\nI am not discouraging you from pursuing math. Some of what you said does indicate that you might like math more. And while you do have issues with study habits, it can be the case that you don't find physics interesting and would develop those habits more easily with a subject you were more passionate about.\n\nBut you want to make sure that you are doing it because you genuinely like the subject better, not as a way to avoid dealing with needing to work and study hard. Math is not easier than physics in the time commitment required or in the level of technicality involved.",

Linear algebra says we can use an 3D orthogonal basis, like x y z, r phi theta, rho theta z, etc. Sweet, now we have these things that we will call coordinate systems. Okay, now how can I model a ball thrown in a 3D space with x y z as the basis? We need something to capture the 'pull' that drags it down to earth. What is that pull? We can call it gravity, but what is gravity? We call it a force, but how do we model force? \n\nI worked backwards when usually you start from established first principles like newtons second or just the idea of momentum, but its the same idea.

For consciousness, there was actually a fairly high impact paper that used methods from QM to quantify long distance synchronization of signals in the brain to show that the brain was near criticality when awake while far away from it while asleep. https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.014410\n\nFlocking dynamics, particle swarms, chemotaxis, and traffic flow all are relatable to microscopic models of fluid flow that generalize to things like compressible gas flow in the continuum limit. https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1118633109\n\nThe key feature of complex systems is that they show some kind of universality. For some systems, this is analyzed using statistical physics methods to show that there is a critical point in terms of some kind of order parameter at which there are certain relationships between the various entities comprising the system (e.g. correlations, susceptibility to perturbations, etc...). In terms of chaotic dynamics, it tends to revolve around showing that systems also exhibit criticality or that they map onto self similar fractals known as strange attractors (e.g. the butterfly shaped attractor in the Lorenz model of atmospheric convection which is known as the butterfly effect in pop science).\n\nRemarkably, these models can capture key features of biological, psychological, and sociological/societal/collective behavior that are directly relatable to our every day experiences and other scientific fields. But in my opinion, it seems like physicists tend to view them as low brow or too applied when compared to the forefronts of research in quantum field theories, string theory, high energy particle physics, etc...",

Doing this Masters in math will not hurt your chances of going into graduate school for physics directly, and if anything will help you because you can prove that are able to do graduate level coursework. Where it *could* hurt you is how intensive the extra work is to do this accelerated program, as in, if this masters would mean you are being less productive or not even involved in research then yes, it will hurt you overall. Now I’m assuming you mean PhD and not masters here, for masters it’ll pretty much only help. If you wish to pursue a PhD in physics the literal best thing you can do is to get as much research experience as possible and present your research at either conferences or journals. This isn’t to say you have 0 chance without research, but it’s to say it’s WAYY more likely to be admitted with a shit GPA but absolutely stellar research than it is to have a perfect GPA (and even a Masters on top) with literally 0 research experience. That would be my main qualm. Overall, if you can get research experience done, i think it’s great to be able to get your BS and MS at the same time to save money and time.",

Everyone who has an interest in physics and is at least somewhat capable of doing maths can do it. And if you're picturing particles making decisions, that's your way and that's fine, as long as you're aware that this is not the case in reality of course. I still picture electrons as hikers with backpacks full of chocolate bars because that's the analogy our physics-teacher gave us back in school. And if you misunderstand tasks because you're creative, that's a good thing. We wouldn't get anywhere in science (or anywhere else) if everyone always approached problems the same way. (Also, how else are you supposed to understand that snowman-task, I'm totally on your side on writing a creative piece).\n\nLong story short: if you want to do it, go for it. And if you have the option to try one or several courses of study that interest you, do that. Here in Germany we have programs that let you try some things out for a semester, maybe there's something like that in Scotland too. And don't stress yourself. I didn't know what to do until weeks after my finals, and for example volunteering for a year after school is also an option too if you need more time.\n\nAlso I have a feeling that it could be interesting for you to read up a bit about autism (if you haven't already), cleared up quite a bunch of stuff for me back then",

Most people reading them will be higher level students or those already with a large education so they look for papers written by people with similar credentials. You should look for published papers with similar topics to those that you are looking into it. It could help to give you an idea of the kind of prerequisites required for what you want to achieve. If you really think that your ideas are worthwhile look into a local university and try to find a professor who does research in similar things. Reach out to them. Something to keep in mind is that physics has become less concerned with why things work and more concerned with how.",

So my most immediate advice for you would be to figure what kind of mathematics is needed to support your idea and learn it.\n\nMy second piece of advice would be to demonstrate that you are aware of modern physics research in that area. Upwards of 99% of \"new ideas\" brought up by people unfamiliar with the field are ideas that have already been thought up and discarded many times before because they don't work and lay people don't have the background to see the flaws. If you think your idea is different, you'll need to prove it by demonstrating that you are aware of what has already been published in that area (not just \"I've read a few pop sci books on Q Mech,\" but actual cutting edge research papers in the areas you're interested in). Unless you can follow the mathematics of quantum or GR, *you don't actually know if you have anything new to contribute.*\n\nI cannot stress enough how much of a red flag a sentiment like \"I've got this great idea, I just lack the math to express it\" is.

        "body": "So I did Applied Physics at Cornell, and I signed up not knowing that we were often regarded as possibly the hardest major, or at least in the top two, at the university. (To be clear, the other major, architecture, is probably harder.)\n\nMy class size was a bit bigger than seven but not much! A classmate and I often got frustrated with one particular guy who, we would detect a mistake in what the professor was writing down, we would write the correct thing down in our notes, we would let the professor go on to other topics, and then like 10 minutes later, when we're on a whole new blackboard, this guy would ask the professor about the mistake and the professor would have to go back and remember what she was writing, and 5-10 minutes later the interruption would be over... This pissed off my classmate so much that he would mouth the word \"harpoon\" at me, referring to an idea of this person being a whale passing by and upsetting the boat and he just wanted to be the sea captain who harpoons the whale and drags it back to shore and never has to be disturbed by it again. So uh, we definitely were small enough that we all got to know each other very well!\n\nTo explain what you are feeling, I would say that I can only learn abstract topics, insofar as I understand what they are abstracting. If I am not understanding this then I can memorize formulas, but I often can't recreate them. I think this is the underlying base for why it helps us learn if we try to teach someone else? \n\nBut, you will notice that this conversation about abstract things, is itself abstract. So I like to concretize it. Let's do that.\n\nLearning, is pain. The word itself means two different kinds of things. You might learn about a train crash in the news, but you know about trains, I will mention a city it happened near or a state, and you know where that is, I will mention how many people were injured or died, that will give you a sense of how much tragedy you are supposed to feel. You learned about this thing, but actually it was just a reconfiguration of a set of things that you already knew: trains, crashes, and deaths. And in fact pop-science and news has to be this way, it has to be easily digestible, you need to be able to get in, read for 5 minutes, get the idea, and get out very quick. This is not sensuous lovemaking between yourself and Truth, no, this is something more slapdash and get it over with before somebody sees. Learning news is not painful. \n\nBut, learning the new, is. There's a difference between news and the new. Something like quantum mechanics, if I try to make it easily digestible in 5 minutes, you're not going to get it: not really. And in fact, because quantum mechanics is abstract, it's a way of organizing how we think about other particular things, it's even worse. Because to really understand quantum mechanics I have to teach you about electron spins and the Stern-Gerlach experiment and the double slit experiment, and electron diffraction, and the hydrogen series of spectral lines, and how Larmor's formula predicts that an electron will spiral into the nucleus and if you calculate the amount of time that it will take its actually kind of a difficult expression but I think it comes out in a fraction of a second. \n\nLearning is pain, because an abstraction is a sort of pain relief. If you don't have quantum mechanics, these are all just scattered unrelated observations about the world, there is internal chaos in your head, why is this like that, why is this other thing like that, there is uncertainty and confusion. An abstraction like quantum mechanics says, hey look, here's the underlying pattern. Here's how everything comes together, here's the rule that you can remember that subsumes all of these other rules, and now we've got to apply it to each individual circumstance so that you can fit that into your now-quantum head! ... You have to feel this pain and confusion before the pain-relieving abstraction can do anything to you. \n\nAnd so like I used to tutor physics, and when I started I was like \"raaar here is the Right Way to look at things so you will not be confused!! I will trample your obstacles and you will not suffer as I did!”... Now you can appreciate why this was a mistake. Those kids had to suffer the ignorance, because the topic was new to them. \n\nAnd similarly if you are struggling with formulas going in one ear and out the other, it is probably because your education is so fast-paced that there isn't enough time to really absorb and feel these growing-pains. I know that my undergrad was like that. If you really want to cure this with self-study you can, but it may also help to just interrupt a lecture, maybe okay it with your professor beforehand if you're anxious about it, and say \"I learn best when I can connect these big things to some like concrete examples and numbers, is there like a superconducting circuit or nanoscale system or something with elementary particles or so, that should be my mental example?\"",

The classes don’t get much easier afterwards but at least you’re kinda used to it and for most people I talked to it’s less stressful (I’m personally still in late middle lol). Multivariable calc is usually part of the not insanely difficult stuff, but it depends on what you do in that class. Now about the main question, you only can decide, know your goals and be down to earth about how competitive the field is. To be more likely to get a high paying job you need a competitive grad school, and to get a competitive grad school you need high grades and internships in research, which themselves require high grades. If you go to grad school but your CV is not competitive enough, there are some options that are less research oriented and less competitive. But if you’re looking for a high paying job, astro is not your best bet, even as a top student, so let alone if you only get passes. I personally wouldn’t stay in physics or astro if I had bad grades, as a degree in pure science with poor grades is difficult to value for highly qualified positions. I don’t want to encourage you to abandon your passion, and you can definitely improve if you made it so far (it takes a lot of work and often only shows on the long run), but be honest with yourself about whether it’s a good decision. Make sure you’re in line with what you want to do with your life and ask yourself if a career in astro is still truly your goal or rather a childhood dream that happened to stick with you your whole life and to which you’re now too attached to let it go easily. Ask yourself if you genuinely like physics and more broadly the stuff you learn. Ask yourself what kind of job you expect later. And also, know that engineering is unlikely to be easier :/",

As it really goes through some ideas carefully, even without equations). Another good one by the same author is called Higgs (by Jim Baggott), which is about the history of how the standard model of particle physics was developed. \n\nAside from these, there are really good biography books out there on Ludwig Boltzmann (Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms - Carlo Cercignani), James Clerk Maxwell (The Man Who Changed Everything - Basil Mahon), Freeman Dyson (Disturbing the Universe - Freeman Dyson), Richard Feynman (Genius - James Gleick), Philip Anderson (A Mind Over Matter - Andrew Zangwill), Albert Einstein (Einstein - Walter Isaacson), J Robert Oppenheimer (American Prometheus - Kai Bird & Martin Sherwin), etc. I think you get the point from here on.\n\nThese biographies can be an extremely rich experience (especially as a physics student. As it humanizes many of these names you see show up in your textbook, as well as what discovering these ideas were actually like. Oftentimes, it was far messier than we could even imagine). There are also what I like to call serious scientific biographies. These are biographies that have a lot more rigor and attention to the detailed science (and may feel like a bit of a mix between a casual reading and a serious small textbook). One of the best Albert Einstein biographies is actually this. It’s called Subtle is The Lord - Abraham Pais. There’s also a serious Richard Feynman biography like this called The Beat of a Different Drum by Jagdish Mehra. Hope all of this helps!",

Describe the system using words and diagrams. Define the characteristics (variables) of the system and how they might interact with each other. Write it down explicitly. \n\n2. Look at the whole picture. What is the best concept to describe the system mathematically. Energy/momentum conservation, static equilibrium, kinematics, etc… Here there are many right answers. Some are easier to deal with than others. Choosing the easy one usually takes practice. Here symmetry is your friend. \n\n3. Use the concepts you found to write a mathematical description of the system. \n\n3b. Check your final units using dimensional analysis. When all else fails follow the units. If the units are wrong your model is wrong. If the units are correct, you have a good chance. Make sure you convert your units to SI units. \n\n4. Do the math and get an answer.

        "body": "You need to decide what you want to focus on first; e.g.,  if you want to work on Quantum Computers, schools with lots of condensed matter physics are good to pick.\n\nHere's what I did. I knew I wanted to go into experimental nuclear physics. At that time (6yrs ago), Michigan State University was the #1 ranked grad program for nuclear physics, MIT was #2, Texas A&M, Florida State, Notre Dame, and the Triangle Universities Nuclear Laboratories (TUNL, comprised of Duke, Chappel-Hill, NC State) were all notable nuclear programs. So I applied to most of those except MIT (i had research experience but didn't think I was competitive enough to get into MIT and/or Berkley. But I had done a REU at Mich State and felt i had a good chance with them. I applied to 3 \"reaches\" (UC Boulder, UIUC, and one more (forgot which), 4 \"good fits\" (MSU, Notre Dame, FSU, & Chappel-Hill), and 3 backups (Old Dom, Wayne State, & Duke). I picked these programs based on how many profs were doing research that interested me and each program had to have at least 3 profs I could see myself working with (based on their research description & publications available on their department's profile page). I used this metric because many times a group you want to join may not have funding or be taking new students for whatever reason. In each essay I mentioned the 3 profs by name; e.g., \"Prof X's research into YYY looks very attractive and I believe my experience with ZZZ would allow me to make valuable contributions to his/her/their group.\" This shows that you put some thought into your application and have a goal and backup plans. \n\nI was accepted into 3 of the 10 programs I applied to (a 30% acceptance rate is solid). Then I looked at what each program was offering as far as stipend vs cost-of-living in the region and how many publications in could pump out in 5 yrs at their program. Since the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory at MSU was scrapping their coupled cyclotrons and building a brand new LinAc, I knew that MSU was going to be busy as the NSCL transioned to the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) and that FRIB was going to be THE premier facility in the world for low-mid-energy nuclear experiment. They also had a bunch of other profs doing work in High Energy/particle, and condensed matter. So if I didnt like nuclear i could switch to a different field. Also, the stipend was good for the location and they offered me a Fellowship on top of the normal grad scholarship, so I'd get paid s bit more than the other students in my cohort and get to start research my 1st semester and not have to TA like most of my cohort. \n\nI made the right choice. Despite Covid, I amassed 6 co-authorships, a 1st-author pub, and my dissertation (which i count as another 1st author pub). I got a ton of experience working at our DOE User Facility as well as Argonne Natl Lab. The skills I picked up in my time st MSU landed me 3 post-doc offers and a 6-fig offer in industry, its went for the money, and it was the right choice considering that the current administration is cutting funding to universities and DOE (more than a couple of my friends have had postdoc offers yanked or F'd with in some way due to the political situation). \n\nSo decide what you want to do, identify which programs offer you the most opportunities if your 1st choice doesn't work out, name profs in your essay, pick from multiple offers based on stipend vs cost-of-living and professional development (pick the school which is going to get you the most publications and send you to the most conferences and get you out to other labs/universities for collaborations). \n\nAlso, apply to jobs as well as grad programs. If you dont get selected for a grad program you can still have a great career. But you dont want too much time between graduation and your fist professional job. So apply to both.\n\nAlso, here's grad school rankings. \n\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/physics-rankings?_sort=rank-asc\n\nMake sure you use the \"Filter\" tab to see which programs are ranked highest for the particular field you're interested in; e.g., these are the nuclear rankings...\nhttps://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/nuclear-science-rankings?_sort=rank-asc",

I'm obviously only able to speak from experience, but I had to take a break during my undergrad because I was so burnt out. I suppose the point I'm trying to make is to understand your limits. You very well may be capable of doing much more than I am. Anyways...\n\nThe clear thing is to take as many science courses as you can (within reason). It's important to open yourself up to all of the ideas of science and more importantly, see how they're all connected. In high school you'll take mathematics, geology, chemistry, biology and physics all in separate courses with separate teachers, but they're all deeply related. The work I'll be doing will be astrobiology, where I need to have deep understandings of all of these sciences. If you're trying to understand where life can arise on other worlds, you want to look at bodies of water that can facilitate chemistry, and chemistry is just macroscopic physics, but this chemistry requires energy to actually produce complex macromolecules that life require. Where does this energy come from? It could come from tidal forces on this hypothetical planets moons or maybe even this world is a moon! Then of course all of these processes have their own mathematical formulation.\n\nYou want to do theory though, but it still applies. You won't get heavy into physics theory until college anyways, so open yourself up to all the sciences and read from authors such as Carl Sagan, Richard Feynman, Carlo Rovelli, Stephan Hawking, etc. I'd really suggest to avoid authors like Sabine Hossenfelder or Michio Kaku, they don't work in their fields anymore and seem to just be doing pop science work. \n\nIn the end, take as much mathematics as you can, because that's the most important to theoretical work, but don't close the doors on the other sciences.",

I hope it’s still helpful. Online courseware is important. I found online PDFs of textbooks and downloaded them, and one thing that really helped me understand was to *annotate* them as I was reading. Questions, comments, anything. And DO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS AT THE END OF THE CHAPTERS! When studying for my QM exam, I did 40+ pages of practice, and I got an A in the course :))). Also, I found it extremely limiting to only use one source, so find different sources. Maybe one that’s in lecture format, some worksheets (esp. in astronomy - coming from an Astro student, there’s a lot of online worksheets) and also a package of online notes that’s more math-oriented than word-oriented. This will help you learn in a more full-rounded way, and also help you identify the approach to learning math & physics that works best for you. \n2) Honestly, it was learning to feel stupid. Bit of a strange answer, but my biggest learning curve this year was to stop beating myself up over physics not being intuitive to me. You’re going to get stuck, you’re going to struggle with problems, you’re going to have to ask questions. And yes, you’re going to have weaknesses worth addressing. That’s part of being a physicist. Coming to terms with that was what helped me really start thinking like a physicist. ALSO!! Doing a project about science communication helped me solidify my scientific thinking. Try to explain concepts you learn about to people who don’t know them yet, or people who aren’t studying physics. Explaining out loud helps you come up with analogies and tests your conceptual understanding, as well as exposes any areas you didn’t know you were fuzzy on.\n3) Unfortunately I’ve been learning how to study on my own very slowly, so there isn’t independent-study course material I can recommend someone at an age before I learned to self-study properly, but I can recommend you search for textbooks and physics curricula from places that do support the deeper learning you’re looking for, and start where you need to start. Good luck with everything!",

Ideas such as \"but where IS the particle exactly\" just no longer have any relevance, and this is communicated to students usually by saying that \"intuition fails us in QM\". \n\nSince people live in a completely classical world, they only begrudingly accept stuff like the doubleslit experiment as \"weird stuff\", while consistently visualizing electrons as tiny balls flying through space. The intuition gathered from that world view no longer works in QM and only can get replaced if you actually allow yourself to accept these \"weird\" behaviours in QM as actual truths and not just \"weirds stuff impossible to understand\".\n\nAs you were already told, information plays a big part in QM. One of the first postulates usually tought is \"The state of a quantum mechanical system is completely specfi\u0001ed by the wavefunction\", which is just \"the wavefunction encodes the entire information of the system\" in different words. \n\nFrom that understanding it is intuitive that measurements create information about the system, thus causing wave-function collapse. Its also intuitive that if information like position and momentum simply are not sharply knowable, the wavefunction reflects that, resulting directly in the behaviour of the double-slit-experiment. From that point, almost all ideas, even in QFT, make some kind of intuitive sense.",

The only other way to deal with them is to expand the description of the system to include things in the environment to entangle the system with, but this is very unnatural.\n\nTake the Mach–Zehnder interferometer for example. I can explain the experiment without a whichway detector with a |ψ⟩ that only includes the particle, and interactions with everything else, the beam splitters, is described just with an operator that transforms |ψ⟩. Yet, if you introduce a whichway detector, suddenly I have to either skip over the interaction with it using a measurement update, or I have to include the whichway detector in my |ψ⟩ and express it as entangled with it. I cannot describe what happens to the particle *on its own* just with |ψ⟩, so you're left with a mystery of what is actually happening to the particle on its own.\n\nThat is why it is better to use |ρ⟩⟩ as a more generalized framework for describing quantum systems. It allows you to assign an operator to the whichway detector to describe its effect on |ρ⟩⟩ and then you can evolve |ρ⟩⟩ linearly and continuously without having to include the detector within the |ρ⟩⟩ and just describe the particle on its own. The operator is non-unitary, however. Quantum mechanics makes far more sense when you abandon the bizarre religious devotion people have to \"everything is unitary.\" It's just not. The Schrodinger equation is really just a simplification of the Lindblad master equation in the limiting case when the particle is not undergoing any non-unitary interactions\n\nSecond, quantum mechanics does have built into it the ability to recover local realist dynamics for any system.\n\nThe reason we describe things in terms of |ρ⟩⟩ or even |ψ⟩ in a simplified case is because the uncertainty principle makes it impossible to predict the outcomes of experiments ahead of time. If you condition on the initial state of the system, called pre-selection, and evolve it forwards in time, you will hit ambiguities that prevent you from evolving the state deterministically forwards and you have to switch to a statistical model that merely captures its probabilistic future trajectories, which is what things like |ρ⟩⟩ ultimately capture.\n\nSince unitary evolution is time-reversible, if you start from the end of such a system, with final measured values, called post-selection, then evolve the system backwards in time, you run into the same ambiguities as well. However, quantum mechanics requires forwards and backwards evolution to be consistent with one another, and so if you condition both on pre-selected and post-selected values and then them forwards and backwards to where they meet, you will end up with values for the observables at that moment in time.\n\nThese values you derive this way always evolve locally. They never change unless the system is being interacted with, and if you compute these, you can see quite clearly that particles decide on their correlated values ahead of time when they interact, such as if you entangle two particles they will form their correlations at the moment they interact or are created and not when you measure them at a distance.\n\nThis does not require adding anything to quantum mechanics, you don't need any new entities for this, you just take the Hermitian transpose of the post-selected state, multiply that by the reverse time evolution up to a specific point, multiply that by the observable you are interacted in, multiply that by the forwards time evolution up to that point, multiply that by the initial state, and divide all of that by the complete reverse time evolution of the system and out pops a value for the observable.\n\nThe uncertainty principle prevents you knowing the outcomes ahead of time, probably because they are just genuinely random and so they aren't decided ahead of time. You have to have *both* pre-selected data *and* post-selected data to derive them, but they do exist. The cats is not both dead and alive, it is one or the other, and |ψ⟩ is ultimately epistemic as quantum mechanics is a statistical theory.\n\nThere is certain strangeness in quantum mechanics, but it's always exaggerated. Cats aren't both dead and alive, particles aren't literally spreading out as waves and \"collapsing\" when you interact with them, conscious observation doesn't play a special role, there is no multiverse, etc etc.\n\nThings that are still \"weird\" aren't really *that* unintuitive. It's weird that particles somehow know how to choose values ahead of time in a way that violates Bell inequalities. But I wouldn't use that to speculate on possible \"explanations\" though. It is easier to just say that particles *just do that* and move on with it.",

I think about the chemical energy stored in the food I eat and how it’s metabolized to fuel biological processes. When I drive, I try to conserve momentum to improve fuel efficiency, timing when to let off the accelerator to reduce braking and coast to a stop at the right place. On walks, I pay attention to how much work I’m doing against gravity and try to adjust my pace or route to get more exercise in less time. When I sit down, I think about how the normal force from the chair balances my weight and prevents me from following a geodesic path through curved spacetime. When tossing a ball, I find myself thinking about its trajectory, how it’s governed by gravity, and how its path corresponds to extremizing proper time. I could keep going. I think about it almost constantly, and it allows me to see exactly how beautiful the world is and how lucky I am to somehow be a conscious entity that gets to reflect on these things.",

Given a vector v, the functional T_v which acts on u by T_v (u) = <v, u> is a linear functional (or covector or 1-form). So for every vector, the inner product lets you naturally define an element of the dual space. In fact the Riesz representation theorem tells you that this is all there is to the do dual space: every linear functional in a (complete) inner product space is a inner product with some vector.

Since the pendulum's path is constrained to a circle, the more informative way to look at the problem is to decompose your gravity and tension forces in the radial and tangential directions of the circle. For a gravity force F=mg, the tangential component is mg\\*sin(theta) and the radial component is mg\\*cos(theta). For a pendulum displaced from the equilibrium position of theta=0, the restoring force is the component of gravity that points tangential to the circular path. The tension force points purely in the radial direction, so it is not really the restoring force. The tension force cancels with the radial component of gravity, so that the net force is only in the direction tangential to the circular path.",

For calculus reasoning to work, the length of segment DL with charge dq must be much, much, much smaller than any length scale in the problem. Let's say, 5 orders of magnitude. So if the object is 1 m large then dl is 10 microns. This distance is enormous compared to the size of an atom or the space between atoms in the material. So from that perspective, the material is basically continuous.\n\nIf you are looking at small objects, say on the sub micron scale or smaller, then dl would end up the size of an atom. At this scale, you couldn't say dq was continuous since some bits of dq might enclose and atom and some might not. This breakdown coincides with the rise of quantum effects!

It's convenient to average out the point charges and describe them using continuous charge and current densities. I think this is referred to as an effective field theory.

This is just the Pythagorean theorem (my examples are just triangles that are collapsed). If you tell me a vector has length 5, it can be pointing in any direction, so now I have an infinite choice of vectors -- any vector with its tail at a point, typically the origin, and its head somewhere on the circumference of a circle with radius 5, centered at that point.\n\nYou write vector = magnitude x direction, and that's fine in as much as you're using a unit vector to define \"direction\" and then multiplying that unit vector by the magnitude, but you maybe don't have to think about it so formally. A vector is just an arrow. Unlike a number, it has direction as well as size. The components are represented in terms of basis vectors, typically unit vectors that you choose to construct other vectors in your space and which allow you to get to any point within your space (could be 2D space or 3D or more). The most convenient choice is unit vectors that are at right angles to one another so you have a rectilinear grid, much like the Cartesian coordinate plane and the way you specify points on it. The unit vector you end up with at the end and which you multiply by the magnitude is a vector of length 1 pointing along a line with slope 4/3 . That unit vector is (3/5)i + (4/5)j in terms of the unit vectors of your basis.\n\nEdit: I notice you also write a vector A can be written as Ax + Ay or (Ax)i + (Ay)j. Again, only the latter form includes the unit vectors that you are scaling and so the first form is just addition of numbers and so does not specify the direction.\n\nEdit: Just to be clear, on the second page, you start with A = 5 and then say you can't use i and j to specify it. But that is in fact required to specify the direction and your supposition is then that your vector is 3i + 4j. If you supposed some other values, you would have a different vector.",

You should use a textbook like University Physics by Young and Freedman to supplement the lectures with lots and lots and lots of problems to do. This is very important when learning Physics for the first time, especiallg if yiu are learning via calculus based ones.\n\nIf you find this too hard then follow an algebra based Physics course first from like Khan Academy and follow an algebra based Physics textbook like Giancoli Physics.",

Start with one basic exercise per notion to study. Then go on to more elaborate exercises combining several notions or even problem solving. Keep the course close by and read it only when you don't see how to solve an exercise. It might be helpful to find a book of exercise with separate solutions. Obviously never read directly the solution for a given question, give it a hard try first, and only in case you're stuck or in big doubt, check it out.\n\nAs others said, don't beat yourself too much about it and keep your renewed motivation and focus as much as possible, this is most essential for succeeding studies. :)",

There isn't anything special needed to solve the problems he poses, other than the skills you've developed over the course of your physics degree.

The reality is that you will need to know software like Power BI, Tableau, and some programming (Python, Java, C, SQL, etc.) to get the better/more interesting jobs. You may as well have the computer science background anyway. At the very least, you can get some IT certs because that field isn't as impacted by AI because somebody has to do a lot of that kind of work unlike dev work. And even then, I think there will be more demand for devs in the future who actually understand what is happening vs. people who can do stuff with mainly AI.\n\nThat is all to say, the math is nice and all, but unless you are trying to go for a MS in Stats for math again with like programming/stats/business intelligence software knowledge, you might as well do the practical option, and roll with it. Either that or do engineering. Coming from a math major, if I was able to get through a math degree, I could have done engineering, and I would probably be better off in the long run even if I didn't work directly in engineering. Most of the hardware jobs want a CE or EE background too.\n\nThe whole \"do what you want\" because the other thing won't guarantee you a job is true to an extent, but there are definitely more practical paths that lead to some form of employment. The reality is most employers might be impressed by the math or physics degree, but they won't know what to do with you. Developers sometimes seem to like math grads IF they can really program, but otherwise, there is a reason people study comp sci, and it's because it is the most direct path to the type of job they want to have after school.\n\nDepending on your GPA, you could also switch majors completely, find something much easier for the high GPA (since the type of degree doesn't matter lol), and take the LSAT/go to law school.\n\nSchool is basically a game at this point. Don't get me wrong, you can learn a lot for sure, but there is definitely a way or an easier way to get into any type of program based on what you do in undergrad.

If you are miserable and you hate physics dont do it, but if you love what youre studying nothing else matters. Sure itll be hard but would you rather do something that comes so naturally its easy?",

Introductory special relativity (SR) for physics students is usually taught in a very standard way, with little to no use of classical mechanics. Only when you move into relativistic dynamics are you expected to use definitions of force and energy from classical mechanics. That said, if you're lucky and have a good instructor, they might introduce four-vectors early on to derive these results, which makes things feel much more natural.\n2. Again, it depends on what the course aims to teach. For introductory courses, it's pretty tame, I'd say it's comparable to classical mechanics, and possibly even a bit easier depending on the coursework.\n3. This one's a bit tricky to answer. You can always explore introductory SR and find it enjoyable on its own. But to really appreciate it, you need to spend time with it. If you do, it’s worth every second.\n4. Once more, it depends on the level of the course. For intro-level SR, it's mostly algebra and Calculus I. For more advanced treatments, you'll need to be familiar with vectors and tensors.\n\nBy the way, if you decide to study SR, and since you already have a background in electromagnetism, I highly recommend checking out the books by Schwartz and Ohanian. They derive the entirety of electromagnetism starting from just Coulomb’s law and SR, which is quite elegant.\n\nFinally, for learning SR, I strongly suggest complementing your course with Eigenchris’s YouTube playlist and Morin’s *Classical Mechanics* book. Also, Brian Greene (the popular science physicist) has a free course on his website, which is very good. It follows the same style of Morin and has nice little animations and graphs that you can play around with on your own, along with problem sets. \n\nGeneral relativity is a different beast altogether. You need differential geometry/tensor calculus to even begin understanding what is being talked about there, it is very, very enjoyable though, I loved everything about it. But you really need to give time for it. Good introductory books for that can be found anywhere, but my personal choice is Florence and Nightingale, and Bohmer\n\nIf you want to not spend too much time, then just use Morin's book, it also has a few pages of GR (no tensors used though), and then move on to Schwartz or Ohanian, since you are interested in learning about cool concepts of SR and nothing IMO is cooler than deriving whole electromagnetism!",

Look for answers during lecture, and go to office hours/ask when you still cant figure it out.\n\n2) during lecture, paraphrase what is presented and put it in your own words as much as you can. Prioritize jotting down what the teacher is saying as much as possible\n\n3) optional: read the textbook passage again, hopefully with more understanding.\n\n4)when working problems\n-start with what topic/category the question falls under\n-find that set of equations\n-recall/write down what assumptions/facts you have\n—ex: y velocity at the top of projectile motion parabola = 0. Electric field outside an ideal solenoid=0\n—this is especially important for electricity and magnetism\n-draw a picture of the set up. Label the variables you have, list the variables you need, label the coordinate system. Include your assumptions, and also draw any volume/surface/charge you are integrating/summing over.\n-to equation solve: start with what you need, work your way backwards through until you have a set up that uses what you have  so saying this equation has what I need in it. I it also uses these variables. I can get those variables from this equation and I have the stuff I need to use it.\n—translating physics to math is a skill. You can think of each equation as a sentence. Practice setting up an equation and being able to explain what it means (especially for calculus based physics where you have to set up integrals) \n—-ex: if I want the voltage at a certain point, I need to find how all the charges (line charge) around contribute to it. The charge is spread out in a circle (2pi) with a radius R that I sum over (R dR). This also means if I take a small portion of charge (dq) on the circumference of the circle, I can rewrite that dq by spreading out a constant line charge (line charge) around a circle with radius R (2piR) and just take a portion of that circumference (dR)  \n-> V=k*integral (dq/r) = k*line charge*2pi* integral (R dR/r)\n\n5) When testing understanding practice verbally explaining it, but also explain it to another person. If you don’t have questions to take with you to office hours, this is a great thing you can do - ask to explain the concept to the TA/professor to make sure you get it and they can correct you\n\n6) work with people whenever possible. At the start of the semester invite people to do homework/ study together. If you find yourself asking them more questions than your answering and feeling self conscious about it, try getting started on the problems before meeting, that way you can do as above and explain what you did and why (they can correct you if wrong) and help you move forward. \n\nI cannot emphasize enough how learning is a social activity. Collaborating with others will greatly and more efficiently improve your understanding of the material.",

        "body": "So the function of note-taking for me is maybe different than it is for some other people. Initially, it was the same, I was trying to create a supplementary educational resource in the form of my notes that I could turn to. But then I noticed that I didn't actually turn to it when solving problems, and often while trying to use it as intended—really go through the notes—I would discover that they were incomprehensible because some sentence or statement or approach-vector had been left out.\n\nEven worse, when I tried to solve that problem by being super thorough, my retention of the lecture dropped to zero. So that wasn't workable either.\n\nSo that is where my current approach turns the purpose of notes on its head... I maybe have a high functioning bit of ADHD or something,  the note-taking was whatever it needed to be,  to maximize my attention on the lecturer and hear their story. I would usually start with a bulleted list of incomplete sentences barely holding together because lectures usually start with \"here's some context, last time we saw X but you might reasonably wonder about Y...\" ... my bullets would say \"• last time: X • what about Y • Z • [ why tf bunnies are Fibonacci? ] • basic problem:《ALL CAPS THING》.\"\n\nAnd the key to this whole note-taking strategy is, that piece of paper is absolutely disposable. It has doodles, it has random questions (the bunnies) that came to mind that have nothing to do with the class but if I focused on them in the lecture, I would probably go down some rabbit hole (har har) and lose track of what was being said. \n\nSometimes those doodles might be the equations that the professor is working on, but I didn't want to ever have a commitment that every single thing they write is going to be on my paper. In fact, the most common equation I would write would be the ones that the professor included an error into. Because that would distract the f@$% out of me if I didn't have the correct version written down somewhere, living its own best equation life, having perfect little equation babies.\n\nAnd here's the deal, afterwards, if I felt like this was one of my harder lectures and a harder topic to follow or do homework in, that's where I might try to invest an hour or three taking the pages of scribbles and whatever lecture slides were on the course website and the textbook... and try to make a document that would teach this lecture to someone else. Sometimes those were in LaTeX or MATLAB or Mathematica because ADHD brain—I decided to start learning LaTeX randomly that week etc.. But sometimes it was paper with color coded pens and diagrams and whatever. The sooner I can do this after the lecture the better, but it takes a lot of time, so I don't usually do it for most of my courses or even for most lectures in my problem courses.\n\nNow that I am in business, with meetings, I find that I need to do some amount of diagramming and doodling, and hopefully it doesn't come across as disrespectful. The key thing is, if I am writing words or reading words or anything to do with language then that's part of my brain that cannot be used to listen to the lecturer. So if my goal is to maximize listening then my notes are necessarily shitty and that has to be ok with me.",

        "body": "This happens often, usual suspects are trying to understand something which has large amounts of future theories required to fully grasp the initial concepts. For example, when starting with EM , it begins with relatively straightforward postulates like Coulomb's Law or Gauss's Law. These seem manageable in simple scenarios. But when trying to explain a realistic scenario, or even slightly more complex ones, we quickly find we need a lot more mathematical machinery and conceptual linkage, and for a beginner, it's genuinely overwhelming. Reaching the full elegance of Maxwell's equations itself is a journey, involving integrating concepts about electric fields, magnetic fields, changing fields, and currents.\n\nThen, going into how electromagnetic wave interacts with matter is the next significant hurdle. Even with Maxwell's equations under your command, applying them to materials, boundary conditions, wave propagation, and phenomena like reflection, refraction, or dispersion adds a lot of complex layers. With all these tools, we are often only equipped initially to explain basic dynamics or highly idealized situations.\n\nThe key thing to remember is that physics requires often non-linear in understanding, it's a cumulative process. Concepts introduced early on, like those in intro EM , are foundational. They might not \"click\" entirely until you see them applied in later courses like optics, wave physics, quantum mechanics, or even relativity, where their deeper implications become clearer. What seems abstract or confusing now will provide key insights later on in advanced topics. \n\nIt's good that you are comfortable with vector calculus. Don't worry too much about the initial struggle. Could there be a better way of learning and teaching physics? I don't know, but not completely understanding a concept is something most people face. It's either they don't understand, or they understood it wrong. The full picture often comes later. Someone told me once, Physics often involves holding multiple abstract ideas in your head simultaneously, and building the intuition for how they connect takes time, practice, and revisiting the material from different angles. Persistence is key, and often, understanding is a gradual process rather than a single aha! moment.",

Then an evil alien from outer space who is 100x stronger appears in the season finale and kicks everyone's asses. The second season is just the good guys getting beaten down over and over but they get stronger with every loss. The season 2 finale is an epic battle with hadoukens and newly unlocked psychic powers. You hardly recognize the protagonists as the normal people from season 1 because they are now so freaking badass.\n\nThat's you. You're so much better at physics now than when you started.

They have a three year program for transfers instead of a two year one. You’ll be retaking the entire lower division series before going into the upper divisions stuff. There is an option to test out of this and go the two year route. I highly recommend the three year path. I believe about half of transfer students dropped out before this was implemented as CC were not enough to prepare for the upper division courses. The lower division stuff is much more rigorous than the CC courses. Additionally it’ll give you another year to build connections and do research. Research opportunities for undergraduates are widely available.\n\nYou can also do research while in CC. I had a lot of peers who did REUS during their summer breaks. The only downside to this route is that it’ll add an additional year to the usual 4 year track. But i think the money I saved and the scholarships I was able receive as a result of my CC days made it entirely worth it. Additionally CC vibes were much more fun :)\n\nThere’s a lot to consider in your position. Feel free to send me a msg I’d be happy to answer any questions you’d have! Happy to share my experiences",

        "body": "At this level what you do is probably basic newtonian mechanics. When I was in high school, I had a literal mental block with vectors in physics (chill in math), and generally physics REALLY didn’t click for me, while I had excellent grades in maths (my physics teacher was really surprised when I told him my math grades lol, he almost couldn’t believe it). In college (before university, but with uni level intro science classes), I felt exactly as you do now, I could get some problems done but it just didn’t click for me at all. And then later, in university, I switched major and started physics, first class was classical mechanics, and newtonian mechanics, conservation of energy etc FINALLY clicked and felt very natural, literally 4 years after the first time I encountered newton’s second law for the first time, and now I have very high grades. At your level, if you’re good at math and in a similar situation as I was, physics can be hard (at least it was for me) because of the lack of a mathematical enough approach in physics and a need to rely more on intuition, and that inution needs time to build :/ in more advanced physics, everything is well formulated mathematically and there is no ambiguity on why is this like this or like that, so it’s easier to start by relying on math skills and build intuition from there. So yeah, it’s normal that you struggle, but you shouldn’t feel dumb, just bad at physics, and it’s ok because it’s definitely not permanent and if you continue in a physics or physics related degree, it will totally change if you put in the work and keep your math skills sharp, given that you’re ok in math. I’m guessing if you’re in IB you’re aiming for high grades to get admissions, in this case, just do your best, keep working, and watch videos on youtube (organic chemistry tutor does a pretty good job for IB level). Videos are very helpful because they build progressively, and once you get the basis from there, you can start with confidence the problem sets that are usually more difficult. Ask for advice, work efficiently, work a lot, do your best ; besides that, there’s nothing much you can do about it, so just do it.",

Some kind of undergraduate teaching position, or any other miscellaneous experience you find interesting, can also be nice.\n* Graduating early is impressive, but unfortunately no one will care. I'd recommend staying the full four years and building a stronger foundation. If you do decide to graduate early, you could consider lining up a postbacc research position to make up for it.\n* Especially for theory, you can never go wrong with extra math. I often recommend the full double-major if it doesn't interfere with other priorities.\n* Programming experience is very necessary, and taking at least one formal course is ideal (preferably Python).",

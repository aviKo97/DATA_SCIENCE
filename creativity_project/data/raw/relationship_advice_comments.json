He was deceptive. He was manipulative in truely evil fucking ways. \n\n\n\nHim claiming he was working, so took up even more labour, when he was just actually just chilling out, as you are falling apart. Is just fucking evil. \n\n\nLike i can't quite see how this could be an otherwise good person who had a \"blip\". \n\n\nI hope for your sake it is/was. \n\n\nI also hope you are placing protective elements in place around you financially, and socially and emotionally,  ...in case the fucking truely evil man he was for the duration of your pregnancy & all post birth - ever shows up again. \n\n\nI hope you can feel safe with him again for your sake, but I also kinda hope you dont let your guard down kinda ever - because he had shown you that when he feels like it, he will become your worst enemy and do it happily whilst sleeping peacefully with a smile. ",

They DO know what they’re talking about, because your experience isn’t actually all that unique. It’s unfortunately extremely common. \n\nWith that said, glad you’re feeling better.

Your husband has failed this part and seems to be blaming you for this.\n\n\nGo check out r/triathlon or r/ironman and see tons of different stories and ways that people successfully managed full time jobs, triathlon training, and busy family lives together. Some people do split days, or wake up hours before everyone else for their first workout, or stay up late and get sessions in after everyone has gone to sleep. It is definitely feasible to do the sport without sacrificing your family, it just takes sacrificing other aspects of your life.",

Talk immediately to a lawyer, get advice on how to do this without catching a kidnapping charge but: Find a time she's going to be out of the house, don't tell her you're leaving, and then get in contact with her via proxy and don't speak with her directly. If she manages to get her mental health sorted out, she'll understand why you did it. But if she doesn't get herself sorted - well, female family annihilators are much, much rarer than male ones, but they do exist. Your children are in danger and keeping them safe has to take priority over everything else.\n\nOnly your friend knows which one is true. If he's exaggerating things or downplaying his role, he needs to take his responsibilities as a husband and father more seriously. If he's telling the truth though, he needs to take the *situation* seriously and keep his kids safe.\n\nIf someone who lives in the same house you and your kids sleep in makes threats like that, you **must** take action unless you want to end up crying on the news about how \"you saw the signs but should have taken them more seriously\".",

I think most people in your position would be pretty upset by this, and your gf is acting very aware that she has done something wrong. \n\n\nRemember, if this is a dealbreaker for you, then it's a dealbreaker for you. Your girlfriend doesn't get to change that, no matter how guilty she may feel or how much she may cry. \n\n\nAlso, this doesn't HAVE to be a dealbreaker, you may decide that your girlfriend gets to do something this dumb once, and if she shows genuine remorse and works to build up trust again, you don't need to walk away. \n\n\nBut either way, the worst thing you can do is let this fester or brush it aside.",

This doesn't just have to be limited to matters of what happened - you could also ask her what her motives, feelings, or mindset was at the time.\n\nEven if you feel certain that there wasn't anything going on between them other than tickling, you could tell her how you feel about this kind of interaction with other people outside of the relationship, and ask her for her thoughts and feelings, as well. If you two disagree, then you should talk things out until you can find common grounds on what's okay and not okay. The goal should be setting expectations for the future that you can both agree on.\n\nIf you find that her behavior has broken your trust in her, you may have to consider whether there's anything that can be said or done that could help you rebuild trust in her.

Maybe she's really just...talking deep and nurturing these men, but uh...1) why doesn't she do that with you instead? And 2) why are these older men happily entertaining a younger woman? I know my husband finds having to be the dad to a younger person exhausting, so f off with any crappy bio-essentialist takes about men. Is it maybe because they like getting their ego stroked? Is it maybe that your girlfriend likes getting *her* ego stroked by the attention? How well is this going to go in the future when she's older and feels less attractive?",

The whole “sitting in the waiting room” thing always seemed to me like something people only do in movies, or like major emergencies or something? \n\nI want to offer my own perspective here as someone who had two major knee surgeries in 2021, and while there were covid restrictions in place especially for the first one, my mum just dropped me off at the hospital and picked me up after and that was it. I don’t think without covid restrictions it would’ve been very different. The nurses helped me call her and my partner right after the surgeries, but no way they would’ve allowed someome to just hang around in a bedroom waiting for the patient to get in there (which it sounds like you were expecting, since you mentioned waking up to an empty room). Also, I would never have asked my mum to stay the whole time - the first surgery took 6 hours, the second one 2 hours and quite frankly she’s got better things to do than sit on a chair doing nothing for that time. So from my perspective, it wouldn’t be assumed that someone waits around during a scheduled surgery. I understand that you had a different expectation, but unless that was very explicitly communicated between you and your boyfriend, I don’t feel that he did anything wrong other than having his phone on silent (which can happen). I would also think that the nurses would rather family members left than hang around randomly for hours.\n\nEdit to add: \nNot sure where you are and if hospital procedure is different there, but in Germany where I had my surgeries, when you wake up you’re in a “waking up room” just with nurses and other patients - they wouldn’t let your partner or family members in there anyway. It’s the nurses’ job to make you feel comfortable, manage your pain and calm you if you’re upset, and settle you in a room before any partners or family members get involved anyway.",

His parents told him they were tight in money and cannot afford his sister’s expenses so he volunteered to cover her tuition that is approximately 140,000 pesos per year. I was surprised to know that she was enrolled in a private school, because tuition fee in state colleges now in our country is free and other schools have much lower tuition fee. His parents told him that they were also retiring. His parents had his sister in their 40s. He told me that he is already talking about his sister in med school and I told him it will be difficult for us to sponsor her education knowing we will have our own baby. I had a sensitive pregnancy so I resigned in my hospital work to avoid miscarriage but I retained the light work load so I still have my own income. After he told me his decision, that’s when I decided I will reapply for hospital work despite going to 3rd trimester but I will save for my baby. I am also planning to go to Australia so I will take the exam after delivery. I reacted this way because last year during our wedding prep, he saved for our wedding but I still share with the expenses but our daily expenses, date nights, travels and vacations were also paid by me for 7 months. I am afraid it will happen again but this time we have a baby. He showed me his budget for us once he is on land is 100k pesos. I do not know how long will that cover for us. So I have to work immediately after I give birth. I think his family will think of me as a villain once they knew about my decision, but my priority is our baby and our family’s future.",

You need to get all your bills and monthly expenses together. You'll need to add on for your baby. Including daycare. Do not have family wat h your baby unless you trust them 100% to do exactly what you want. Otherwise, you'll have more of a headache and hassle than you'll want. There's hundreds of stories here you can read about it. Once you've gotten all the bills gathered, you'll need to decide how they'll be split. Do you make close to the same amount, 50/50 split. Does one of you make a little more than the other 60/40 split. Does one of you make a lot more than the other, 70/30 split. Once the bills are taken care of, there are still college funds, savings, and retirement funds that you each need to contribute to. That is also proportionate to how much you earn. But should be putting at least 15-20% of your checks in, if not more weekly. The rest is fun money for your own personal accounts. That money is what DH can spend however he wishes. He can spend it on school for his sister or whatever else he wants. But he's gonna be in for a huge shock when he realizes he can't afford to pay for her studies without taking out a loan. Before he does that, you need to get a postnuptial stating that any debt he incurs will be his if there is a divorce. Since he is the one taking a loan to pay for sisters schooling. If it comes to that. He'd be stupid to do it. But some people can't stop themselves from tryna be the hero for other people and leaving their family to suffer for it. \n\nOr you can straight up tell him if he pays for his sisters school and doesn't pay his half of the bills plus baby expenses, then you will divorce.

It can really help with bonding in a safe environment.\n\nRegardless, there is no shame in being admitted to a psychiatric unit. She’s not a failure or a bad mom, she just needs a little help right now.

By seeking help now she’s potentially averting something more serious.\n\nOn a general adult psych ward, she is likely to see some upsetting or unusual things. It can be quite shocking at first, but it’s important she works through these feelings with her team. On the flip side, patients often form strong relationships with others on a psych unit that may understand better what she is going through.\n\nIt’s difficult to open up, but by being honest about her feelings - however difficult or distressing - will help her to get the support she needs.

Important to note that it may look different depending on where you're from, I'm Scandinavian.\n\nSo first of all, it's nothing like the movies. It's not this scary place, it's similar to being at the hospital, but for your mental health.\n\nAbout being \"locked up\", at least where I live, being forced to stay is very rare. It's only in the extreme circumstances where you're a **high** treat to other's or your own life.\n\nIf your wife goes there willingly, I highly doubt they'll force her to stay if she absolutely wants to go home. \n\nThe best thing about inpatient treatment is that you don't have to wait for anything. They'll closely follow you up with medications, treatment plans, etc. I got more done on a one week stay than I did during an entire year treatment wise.\n\nShe doesn't have to interact with other patients if she doesn't want to. Of course, there can be patients there who are really sick (and they **rarely** interact with other patients), but unlike the movies, many of them are just \"normal\" people, in the lack of a better word.\n\nLike you'd expect this \"looney bin\" stereotype we all have in our head, but it's not like that. There are more people similar to your wife than she'd might think.\n\nI get that it's scary, and I'm not saying it's like a vacation. But changing environments, getting away from home, getting treatment on the spot, and getting your routines in check can be a very nice experience. You also always have someone to talk to who's experienced and educated in mental health.\n\nIt's really not that bad. It can be boring sometimes, but they usually have a lot of stuff to do. I started drawing and whatnot, which I've never done before lol. If she ever wanted to try a new hobby, this is the place for it! \n\nNot to mention, you need a break too.

Got group therapy twice a day and spent the rest reading and chilling. Spent time on the landline phone with family when I needed it and my parents visited.\n\nOthers hated it. Especially those who were committed against their will or going through withdrawal. Often both.\n\nThe nurses were a mixture of great, decent and meh. Noone was abusive or mean, some just checked out as they deal with crazy all day and it can be taxing. We had lock down 3 times in the total twice ive been there (both drug related) due to another patient. One tried to bash the bullet proof (idk if ifs actually bullet proof but its thick af) glass open with a chair to escape or kill themselves. Idk which. Another tried to slam themselves into the exit locked door crying due to fetty and meth withdrawal. The last got into a fight over that delicious white cheddar popcorn they had with another patient. The other guy stole their bags while they were in the bathroom and they went at it.\n\nLike I said I think it was very chill. You learn your schedule, get free meds and get to nope out of reality for a bit. It'd also be a great spot to nail down a dose for whatever meds shes going to need going forward.\n\nThe biggest issue id forsee is that most mental health problems aren't fixed with just a break for a bit. It can be super helpful but there's a good chance stuff will come back once your on the outside. Make sure she uses the time to nail down medications, a plan for when shes overwhelmed, a schedule for when shes out, relaxation methods, etc.\n\nIt can be very easy to just sleep all day in there, skip therapy and feel amazing after 6 days of no stress and go \"im fixed let's go\". Then the reality of the world comes crashing back and you head back to the safety of the facility. The best use of it is enjoying the break from reality you get but also use the free time to explore your mind (how you handle stress, triggers, etc) and make plans. Who will you call when you can't handle it? At what point do you go back? How do you communicate that? How do you communicate your emotions in general?\n\nYou also don't want her to become a regular unless she really has to. A vacation is amazing and can feel great. Its amazing stress relief and she might feel like shes not ruining your life anymore (just using what others have said when I was there) with her mental health problems and start going back everytime life gets rough. Its easy to retreat to a place of safety when you learn how easy and chill I can be.\n\nAnyway. I loved my times there. Free food. New friends to babble to and hang out with and tell stories. Arts and crafts. *snacks*. Reading all day! Ahhhh. Bring her to a book store before going and pick out a bunch of paper backs! I read all of stargate atlantis books and the expanse during one trip. \nOh and buy some non stringy clothes so she has stuff to change into that they don't need to cut. No strings cus you can kill yourself and garotte others. Sweat pants and comfy no string and no hood sweatshirt. Just cozy clothes. Way better than the scrubs.\n\nOther than that no valuables. They won't allow them on the floor anyway and it's not worth the headache with checking them in.\n\nFeel free to ask any questions about daily routines. Obviously all facilities are unique but I think they tend to be similarish.\n\nSorry you are going through this!",

        "body": "I dont k ow if you're UK ir elsewhere but I'm in UK and was admitted to a mother and baby unit fkr CPTSD and postnatal psychosis after the birth of my third. \n\nI stayed for 5 weeks and its the reason I'm alive now and more importantly, the reason my daughter is still with us and we have a bond. \n\nShe stayed with me and was assigned her own nursery nurse, I was assigned a mental health nurse. \nI saw a psychologist 3 times a week and a psychiatrist 2 times. The nurses were the all day long contacts. \nI was responsible for all the cares of my child and myself, including laundry etc, but had the support of the nursery nurse if I struggled. The only thing I didn't have to do was cook my food. \n\nI was there during covid so my partner wasn't allowed in, however ordinarily dad's (or another chosen family member) would also be on the ward during the day, it was very much focused on all-family healing. \n\nThe days were spent focusing on good self-care habits, bonding with baby, trauma response, and things like grounding techniques for managing severe anxiety. Some other patients might have other treatments but those things were my focus. \n\nI did things like yoga, meditation, we went on walks around the hospital, it was snowing so we went sledging down a hill at the hospital, then there were quieter activities such as puzzles, knitting, baking, colouring, crafts. There were baby focused classes too, so baby massage, baby sensory, baby development and weaning lessons for when they are older, breastfeeding support. \n\nAs you get nearer discharge, I started getting day passes where I go home for a few hours. A nurse came with me to the supermarket and shopping centre as I also was suffering with agoraphobia. The final test before discharge was my husband dropping off my son and I took both son and daughter (15 months and newborn) to the children's part of the hospital to play where I was totally alone (safeguards are in place for this, I wore a band so staff at the play bit new i was an MBU patient) and if I did ok with that, then discharge was finally discussed. \n\nOn discharge to the unit, my bed was reserved for a further week in case I'd need to be readmitted. I was given a community mental health nurse who visited once a week for the following year. I also jumped the list and had a psychologist who I saw once a week for 2 years....had I not been in MBU then that psychologist would have been a 3 year wait list. My children were also assigned a family social worker who was enormously helpful and helped us get the kids into a better nursery and now school. \n\nMy husband was off work for 12 weeks total. 5 weeks while I was an inpatient, and then 2 months following discharge. It took 2 months for me to be confident enough to he home alone all day with a child (my son was in nursery). We very slowly increased the time over weeks. Its a slow process. Be aware that that level of mental health damage is utterly exhausting. \n\nThe day I went to MBU, my health visitor caught me walking my daughter in her pram to the pokice stayion. It was November, cold and dark. I was wearing pyjamas and sandals. Thankfully she was bundled up, I was convinced I'd been given the wrong baby and was trying to give her to the police so they could find her real parents. I had zero bond with her. I refused to even call her her name. I believed that my daughter had been stillborn and they'd given me this one to keep me happy as my first child had already died at 6 months old, so they felt bad for me. I was going to take her to the police station and then jump off a motorway bridge so I could be with my late son and stillborn daughter. My second son was safe and would be raised by my husband. \nI was told I was expected in MBU by 7pm the next day. If i attended myself, it was voluntary admittance and so legally I can leave whenever. But if I didn't show up, then they'd come and get me and id be admitted under the Mental Health Act. In the 24 hours between, I was never to be left alone. Thankfully my inlaws were staying so 3 adults to keep an eye on me and also the kids. My husband drive me there so I was considered voluntary patient and didn't need to involve lawyers to be discharged. \n\n5 weeks later, my daughter was the absolute centre of my world and I had no idea what the heck I was thinking. Its like something had totally possessed me. I still had severe anxiety and CPTSD but the bond between me and my daughter was unbreakable.",

        "body": "Hi OP, \n\nI wanted to validate your struggle by stating that the people responsible for your wife's health really, really dropped the ball here. Being depressed during pregnancy is a RISK FACTOR for PPD. She should have been receiving treatment this entire time, not being told that it would get better. Because that's not how any of this works. Your doctor SUCKED.\n\nWith this knowledge in hand, I would make sure anyone you interact with going forward on the medical side actually knows about PPD and isn't just ignorantly throwing ideas out at the two of you. Treatment for PPD is specialized. It's not the same as treatment for other types of depression or mental health conditions. So when she's in the inpatient treatment setting, please seek out a professional trained in handling PPD, not just depression. They might not be in the inpatient ward but I'm sure they exist in your community. She can get started at inpatient with a psychiatrist and hopefully move to a better outpatient type of treatment specific to PPD going forward after that.\n\nI don't know where you live (sounds like US), but we don't have a lot of good options for the mother-baby unit when it comes to inpatient care. This is somewhat of the gold standard for treatment in other countries. These are inpatient settings where the mother and baby are together so that the mom can establish routines, learn skills, and start to feel bonded. The treatment for your wife for PPD should include helping her feel bonded, safe, and successful as a mother. So she can't just take baths, meditate, go for walks, do cog behavioral therapy about her childhood, etc. That doesn't fix the problem! She'll need explicit training on how to care for her baby where she's at in this moment and being praised copiously for what a good mother she is. She'll need medication likely and social support from you and other family and friends. \n\nI am so sorry this happened to your wife. I was depressed during my pregnancy with my first and knew that it was a risk factor for PPD. So I asked my OB give me a reference to a PPD therapist. This therapist worked with me throughout the pregnancy to lessen my stress, to help me prepare for delivery mentally, and to \"heal\" from previous pregnancy-related trauma due to a miscarriage. She used EMDR and was very insistent that throughout my pregnancy, I prioritize my well being. So no dealing with toxic people, no scary movies, don't even watch the news. Just wrap yourself in a cocoon or herbal tea, sitcoms, and loved ones. Once my daughter was born (it was a traumatic birth), I kept working with her and she helped me bond with my daughter by making sure I felt successful as a mother no matter what my capability was in that moment.\n\nI remember one of our first sessions I was crying about how I couldn't manage motherhood and was relying on my husband to do everything for the baby while I healed from the delivery. I felt utterly useless and guilty about it all. She kindly pointed out that while we were in her office I had been able to eat an apple, talk to her, and feed the baby a bottle. Yes these are small things but being praised for them gave me a big boost. With medication, EMDR, and following her strict advice about sleep and eating and keeping away from stressful, toxic people, I recovered very quickly and went on to bond with my baby and have a beautiful experience as a new mom.\n\nI want that for your poor wife! She deserves to feel that love for your child. So she needs to work with specialists who will help her achieve it. Make sure you ask if the people treating your wife have the correct training. Perhaps you can find a resource for her here:  [https://postpartum.net/](https://postpartum.net/)",

Stop feeling guilty about it cause he'll easily turn that back on you and you'll be manipulated. He cheated. If you want to ,confront him and don't explain yourself . Stop feeling guilty, he's the only one that's done anything wrong. But if you feel what he did was cheating and presumably you wouldn't want to stay with a cheater you really don't even need to confront him. Just leave. He sucks. You ask what we would do in this situation but what would he do ? Would he be understanding? Would he forgive you? What about a hypothetical daughter? What advice would you give her if she were in your shoes instead ?",

Don't forget that preapprovals are just that *Pre* and if economic conditions drop fast enough, banks might decide that your finances do not match theirs (ie they will not move forward) - there are so many what-ifs that it is hard to provide advice.  \n\nOnly other thing I can think of is for you both to create a list of wants and desires, and maybe consider a limited veto on extraneous factors (like the sun direction) for looking at houses going forward, but this is also a difficult recommendation.\n\nGood luck",

Sometimes a good experienced realtor can help knock some sense into him. Here are some points for him: \n\n* No house is going to be perfect. This does not exist. It has to just be good enough. Can you get him to talk about it enough to list what are must haves vs nice to haves? Can he see that afternoon sun is a nice to have and not a must have? This might be annoying but spending time on hashing out what he is willing to compromise on or at least getting him to see that he will need to compromise might be a good place to start.\n* Hint: things that can be addressed in some way should be negotiable (a LOT actually fall in this category) vs things that cannot be changed (mostly, the location!!)\n* Get in the mindset of thinking of this house as your house for the next 5 - 10 years instead of FOREVER. It may be more! But it does not have to be. \n* The longer he waits to invest the money he has saved in the market, the less house he will be able to buy. It's possible that you are earning and saving faster than the real estate is appreciating, but usually this is not the case. The house you can afford today may not be the house you can afford a year from now. \n* Everyone says that they want a place that is sunny or at least isn't dark and depressing. But have you heard of lights?? Seriously though, it is amazing what you can do with a good scheme. You can have several different types of lights in a room that adds layers to the lighting (think overhead + sconces or table lamps + drop and/or floor lamps) and really creates a light and airy feeling, even without very much light coming in from the windows. This can make a HUGE difference. \n\nThere will be things you will hate about the house once you move in. There will be things you will unexpectedly love about it. Or about the neighborhood. Things happen. A high rise might go up casting a big shadow on your house. Or a freeway. Or a cute neighborhood cafe. \n\nBut if you can't move past this, you might suggest therapy. It's up to you as a couple to figure out what the mental block is.",

He may just need more practice/ more time to get comfortable. \n\nIf he’s 36 and never had sex but has only watched porn (just an assumption, idk if he does or not) that can also create some pretty unrealistic expectations for what sex is supposed to look and feel like. \n\nI think just communicating honestly is the best way to go about it. “Hey I really like you and I do want to have sex with you, but I’m not feeling totally satisfied. What can we do to improve it for the both of us?”",

He brings in a lot during the summers and we have student loans and savings. My mom also helps us with rent.\n\nYou *do fine financially* but it's contingent on student loans and your mother helping two grown adults with kids with their rent?\n\nHave you actually convinced yourself that's what *fine* means?\n\nAlso... I'm not saying it's impossible to go to medical school at 31. It happens... sometimes. But it's a fucking long and tough road at that age that requires a hell of a lot of sacrifice and dedication to make it through, and real clarity on why it is you're undertaking a massively long course of training like that at his age. It's, frankly, not a suitable option for a lot of people who already have families and responsibilities when there are terminal degrees you can get much faster and still earn a decent living. And doesn't require a string of unrelated degrees...\n\nI fear you may not be being honest with yourself about your husband's long-term prospects.\n\nAlso, the hell kind of uni requires being there 7am to 6pm? Do you have... actual proof of what he's doing during that time?\n\nSo right now, he gets to treat you like a housewife while you actually also work, he gets to screw around hopping from degree to degree as he pleases, he gets to neglect his responsibilities at home and his children, drive you both into debt with student loans AND put you in a position where you're relying on mom for money... and lets be real, there's no end in sight where you're at least well-compensated for being treated this poorly.\n\nWhat do you want with the rest of your life? Because if it's not propping up your husband who has utterly failed to launch and you're both somehow in denial about it, I'd start seriously reevaluating what exactly it is you're doing.",

I'm thinking that if there's physical abuse you either don't consider it to be abuse or he's made you believe that you've earned being \"punished\". This isn't sustainable and it's not healthy for your child either. There's a [relationship quiz](https://loveisrespect.org) that can give you a more objective assessment of your relationship. If you're not ready to find out if it's abuse then please just look at this resource for the advice it has about healthy communication and boundaries in relationships because it could give you some discussion points. Please think about what your child is learning about relationships from watching how your husband behaves. This isn't your fault and you do not deserve this. I understand that it's scary to consider divorce especially since you don't have your own income, but I recommend looking into your options and rights as far as custody and spousal support where you live even if you decide to stay you could benefit from knowing this information. How far away is your family? Your son is approaching preschool age so maybe it's a good time to consider looking for some kind of employment. Based on how he's treating you I would not recommend telling your husband that you're considering leaving and I would also suggest getting your ducks in a row before you leave. It's not wrong to take your time preparing to leave because you have to protect yourself and your son. It's not dishonest to protect yourself and it's not something you should feel any shame about. Your husband is legally  responsible for providing for you and since you're a SAHM depending on where you live he'll need to continue to support you even after the divorce is finalized. If you want even more information about domestic abuse, use an incognito internet browser tab so the search for the local agency won't be in the browser history and visiting their website won't be logged as long as you remember to close the tabs just in case he checks. \n\nI wish you and your son the best.",

        "body": "There is a lot going on here, and it’s easy to think it’s about attractiveness and weight, but that’s secondary to the issues that are going on. You guys have been together and maybe happy for about a year. In that time, he has watched you stress eat during grad school until you gained, as you said, a lot of weight by doubling or tripling the amount of food you put in your mouth. Now you plan to go abroad, alone. How will you cope with your stress then if you couldn’t manage it at home where you are comfortable? Eating is the obvious choice, because it is the choice you have shown him thus far. Telling him you will loose weight immediately for him? Sounds pretty disingenuous, because you give a bunch of reasons why you overeat and none of those are going to change. If you did nothing to help yourself before, there is no reason for him to believe that you will do it now in some desperate attempt to hold on to him. This doesn’t sound like you (like us all) are getting a bit fluffier as you age. This is major weight gain from anxiety or mental illness being poorly managed by food for comfort rather than nutrition that is forcing him to reckon with the changing nature of the relationship. Imagine watching your partner slowly (or quickly) making their life more difficult every single day. Thinking that you are never going to be able to go on a hike or a camping trip together again because your partner can’t walk down the sidewalk, let alone up a trail. Try and travel together when each step is a pain and you need to catch your breath every couple of blocks. He’s watching you change your life for the worse and is starting to imagine what it will be like if he travels this road with you. Will he have to listen to your excuses over and over while being sensitive to your body issues? Will he try and get you to be more active with him just for you to get angry? Will he have to bite his tongue every time he sees you eat more cookies and say something to yourself like “I really shouldn’t eat this but I will” or make empty promises to lose what you couldn’t stop gaining in the first place? Your lifestyles are diverging, just as it would if a partner took up heavy drinking or drugs or different sexual interests. You’re right, we should be loved for the entirety of who we are, but if who we are includes some difficult habits that don’t bode well for the future it is reasonable to step back and look at the big picture to see if the path you’re on is leading to a place you want to be. If you go away for a year having done nothing to change the path you’re on, it’s realistic for him to imagine you being even bigger and more unhappy when you return. It’s good that he has expressed his uncertainty with you. It’s great that you want to continue to learn and be educated. Break up with him and start taking care of yourself. Go to therapy and develop different coping mechanisms that don’t entail eating your emotions. Sure, you can focus on the superficial and just believe that your boyfriend doesn’t want a fat girlfriend and he’s a jerk. Or you can look inward, figure out the basis for your unhealthy habits and find ways to manage your health for your lifetime. This is not a “temporary problem” that you can fix so he can be happy. This is a permanent decision to put yourself first and be healthy mentally and physically so you can feel good about yourself. If you’re happy with yourself now, find someone who is happy with you as you are. If you’re unhappy with yourself, figure out how to make yourself happy and healthy and whole.  Thank your bf for being honest about his uncertainty, and is that to be honest with yourself.",

You will realize you *maybe* solved one issue, but introduced four others. Then you focus on those five issues in the third attempt and realize that in solving those five you introduced twenty more.\n\nIndeed, if you haven't put in the effort in your first marriage, you're far more likely to end up divorcing again because you won't put in the effort in the second or third marriage either. And the success statistics for second and third marriages include widows and widowers, so the odds are even worse.\n\nI'm not against divorce. I'm against divorce when there are no or only half-hearted attempts at fixing things.\n\nAnd OP is not in an abusive relationship, and has clearly articulated her needs and has an objective. If her husband is coöperative, and she hasn't indicated he's completely uninterested in fixing things, working things out is a much better prospect for them.",

I’ve thought about it and I agree that this is a delicate situation and initiating and conversation that’s driven by you explaining etc (a soliloquy basically) will only raise unfounded suspicions. \n\nWhat if, instead, you just go to your husband and as how he’s feeling? Tell him you know him inside and out and can tell something is troubling him. Just listen to his response. No interjections, no demonstrative head nodding or shaking. Just 100% focused, attentive listening. Let him drive the conversation. Respond only when he’s finished or asked you a pointed question. In doing so you clearly havent preconceived/planned the discussion agenda and thus can’t really come off as a  spin doctor as you fear you might.\n\nFair warning: As brilliant and intuitive as your husband may be, his Nostradamus level of intuition and foresight here is probably not as seer-like  as it might seem. You have no reason to lie anonymously to strangers on the internet, so I fully believe you genuinely thought Dan/your interactions with him seemed normal/above board. To warn you about him that day or sometime soon before the BBQ leads me to believe he noticed something about  how Dan acts around you/how you act around him (largely subconsciously I presume). Be prepared for some self examination and above all else be honest with him. \n \nLet us know what you end up deciding and if there’s anything worthy of an update. Fuck Dan. \n\nWishing you the best,\n\n-C",

Your husband tells you to be on your guard around Dan because of a feeling he had and next thing you do is to invite Dan to your bbq? Not only that, you also allowed a situation to happen where you were alone with Dan in the kitchen for some time? Be honest, have you ever taken what your husband said serious? Were you on your guard? From the outside, it doesn't seem like it.\n\nThen think about the future. How do you want to handle Dan? Will he work in your company? Can you avoid him? Do you even want to avoid him? That are things you need to answer yourself and then talk with your husband about.\n\nEDIT: When you talk to your husband and you agree with what I write now, then start that conversation with thanking him for protecting you. \n\nIf it was truly a coincidence that Dan kissed you when your husband showed up, imagine what would have happened if your husband wouldn't have been there.

He doesn't know how you could be oblivious to Dan's, from his perspective, obvious intentions even after he warned you. He's wondering if you're truly oblivious or not. Whether you will see this issue with others and take action or whether you'll \"ignore\" even his warnings again. \n\nIf you will just let the obvious happen without pushing back what would have happened had he not been there to stop it? What happens with the next guy he knows is an issue, does he literally have to stand guard and vet your interactions? I don't believe he thinks that you're a cheater in any deliberate sense at least. But his confidence in you and your abilities / desires to enact strict boundaries against a clear threat. Well that has been shaken so he's examining your life with at least some paranoia. I don't know you so maybe you carry yourself in a completely upstanding manner. But if there is even the slightest case of lines being nudged that previously would not have been an issue to him due to trust, confidence and the benefit of the doubt. He's reexamining these. Just give him time and be open and his confidence in you will regrow. When you two do talk make sure to acknowledge that his warning was valid so if ever there's another snake lurking around he knows that the threat will be eliminated there and then without him having to punch out the scumbag in his kitchen.

These men  are one-dimensional, arrogant, inflated fragile egos, selfish, thoughtless, abusive, entitled, have low emotional intelligence (ie empathy, self awareness, etc), are zero sum thinkers, can only consider simplistic solutions to complex problems, and are very immature and childlike. They are status obsessed and often need to put others down in order to feel important. Unfortunately, you can’t make someone like this grow up, learn to like themselves but be humble and truly care about anything beyond themselves.  They often complain about sex (not enough, not kinky enough etc), and are so socialized by patriarchy that they never realize that their own lack of care and emotional dysfunction are the problem. It doesn’t occur to them to meet anyone else where they are, or to meet them halfway, and if they do, it’s transactional (laundry in exchange for sex etc). Men like this don’t know how to have a functional relationship.  \n\nWhat you need to do is express how his insecure need for dominance in your marriage is destroying it from within.  You want a partner who respects you as an equal, cares and nurtures the relationship.  You are not a sex doll or a maid. You are a whole person. It doesn’t sound like he is mature enough to handle this conversation and if he can’t, that tells you everything need to know about your next steps. ",

Hell, I live in the US again now just a few states from where I grew up and there’s stuff like specific foods I can’t get here that I miss. And I haven’t lived “back home” since 2001.\n\nOne thing I could not do now is live in the south. Not in this political climate as a woman and in healthcare. I’d be out as fast as I could. And small town living just makes it worse when you’re in Trump humper land. I get it. \n\nHere’s the reality. You’ve got a child. You can’t leave the area, you can’t leave the state, and you absolutely can’t leave the country legally with your child without his consent should you divorce. You can’t even get a passport without his sign off. \n\nSo if he’s adamant about not going, I think you’re going to have to invest your energy in finding a way to make this liveable for you because you can’t leave. You could leave him but you can’t leave the area unless you leave your child behind which I assume is a no go (I hope!).\n\nWhen I’ve had to live in places I didn’t much love, I found a way to love it. I made friends through my hobbies and volunteer work. I found like minded people and cobbled together a family of friends. When I’ve been abroad in places with few Americans, I still reached out to the closest consulate or embassy and found other expats (or like in Mauritius with only 2 Americans on the damned island, hung with the Brits).\n\nI think you’re going to have to find a way to make this work because he has the power here.

For instance - that major city...did you enjoy living there? Or maybe another city? Something that's close enough that his family is there, but far enough away that you have some space? Or hell maybe farther away, but still in the US so it's easier to visit his family? I'm not ruling out you moving home, but I would suggest looking to see if there's a solution between \"staying where we are\" and \"move across the ocean\". \n\nI would also suggest couples therapy. Him dismissing you as overreacting and thinking that things are fine where you are is a big problem. Which probably plays into you wanting to leave. He's not listening to what you're saying about his family and thus is not able to run interference or establish boundaries that are needed. Couples therapy may illuminate that for him. If he's against couples therapy...there's entirely different decisions to make.",

Moving countries is already huge, and doing it with a new baby while navigating culture shock and feeling disconnected from your work... that's a lot for anyone to handle.\n\nWhat strikes me is how your husband dismissed your feelings as potentially just postpartum depression. While it's good that you're getting support for that possibility, it feels like he's not really hearing the deeper stuff you're sharing about feeling uncomfortable and outnumbered with his family's views, or how much you're struggling with this major life change. It could also be him not wanting to make a big life change if it may be influenced by other factors. \n\nThe thing is, both of your perspectives make sense on some level. He sees the practical benefits of being near family support with a baby, and you're experiencing a really profound disconnection from everything that felt like home to you. Neither of those feelings are wrong, but they're pulling in completely different directions.\n\nSometimes when we're in relationships, especially with big decisions like this, it can feel like someone has to \"win\" the argument. But maybe there's space to explore what a middle path could look like? Like spending extended time in the UK periodically, or having honest conversations about a timeline for potentially moving back when your child is older.\n\nThe part about feeling outnumbered by his family's increasingly vocal views sounds really isolating. That kind of social stress can compound everything else you're dealing with. Your comfort and sense of belonging matter too, and they affect your ability to be present as a partner and parent. We could also explore the possibility of building a stronger bond with this side of this part of your family :) \n\nAs someone who works with couples navigating major life transitions, I've seen how these kinds of disagreements can either create deeper understanding or become a wedge that grows over time. The key usually isn't one person convincing the other, but both people feeling truly heard and working together toward something that honors both of your needs.\n\nHave you two talked about what specifically makes him feel like moving back doesn't make sense? And have you been able to share the deeper emotional impact this is having on you beyond just being homesick?\n\nFeel free to DM me if you want to talk through any of this more privately.  <3",

It's intended to make you feel exactly the way you do, like there's no way out. The only way you're going to be able to connect with people and find support is by getting out of that relationship. Your family and former friends are likely to come back around once they see you making changes in earnest. But check in with your people and let them know you're serious about getting out and you need whatever help they can offer (ideally help with paying off the tickets, a place to stay, and an attorney).\n\nThe only way your children will ever know a home filled with love and respect is if you get them the hell out of there. First, you must separate finances. Make sure she has no access to your paychecks going forward, your share of the bills should be paid directly to the payee. Prioritize getting those tickets paid off - look into setting up a payment plan and set it for autopay. If a payment plan isn't an option, create your own payment plan where you deposit money into a separate account until you have enough to settle the tickets. But definitely check to see if the courts are willing to work with you. \n\nBe sure to start building your case. If you have visible injuries, take photos. Record relevant conversations - even if you live in a two-party consent state (or wherever you live) at least record them for your own reference. Keep a journal of every abusive and distrustful thing she does, with dates, times, locations, and as many details as you can muster. You're going to need this for divorce and custody proceedings. \n\nI know it seems incredibly daunting right now, but as long as you are making progress, day by day, you will get there.

Some people definitely do it for the wrong reasons. Most that I met were wanting to tweak something about their face that they’d not been in love with for a long time. No one else maybe noticed, but for them, it was the first thing they saw every time they looked in the mirror and they *assumed* that you see them the same way. \n\nMost people I met were not wealthy tbh. They’d worked hard all their lives and now wanted to feel good with a splurge for the nose they always wanted, the youthful lifted eyes, thinner jawline, etc. A specific case that comes to mind: someone was assaulted by their drunk partner and desperately wanted to fix the damage. We did fix it, that PT was able to move forward from that trauma. \n\nYou’re viewing this from a harsh lens of not liking aesthetic work. It’s okay to not be into cosmetic medicine. It’s not great to feel that you need to dictate what she can or can’t do to the point that she felt the need to hide it. It’s also not great that she did hide it, but I’d argue that that was more due to expecting your reaction to be as it is.\n\nI get having concern especially if she went with a poor quality surgeon, but barring the concern, try supporting her also. For me, I was able to get rid of a family trait that tied to trauma. Ever since, it’s been night and day for my confidence. I feel like I’m a different person fwiw and it made my relationship stronger even if it wasn’t for his tastes cuz I’m more into him simply by being more confident 🤷🏼‍♀️\n\nAnd on the herpes medication note… we frequently prescribed valcyclovir (antiviral) to prevent cold sores after lip injections, laser treatments, etc. Cold sores are ugly and they’re easy to prevent.",

Her autonomy and privacy don’t seem to matter to you, yet you are accusing her of violating trust.\n\nYou say you are concerned but what you are expressing is actually control. You want her to check with you before changing how she looks. You say you would find her less attractive if she kept going. That is not love. That is entitlement.\n\nYou suggest she has body dysmorphia or an addiction but never ask why she might feel unsafe being honest with you. You paint yourself as the calm, rational partner while making her sound secretive, untrustworthy and unstable. But everything in this post is about your fear, your image, your preferences.

The fact that he's a great dad but lacks as a partner creates this impossible tension where you can see his good qualities but still feel completely unfulfilled.\n\nWhat you're experiencing right now - feeling nothing when he kisses you, struggling to find that spark again - that's actually really common when someone has emotionally checked out. Your body and heart are protecting you from more disappointment. It doesn't mean you're broken or that there's no hope, but it does mean you've been hurt deeply enough that your system has gone into self-preservation mode.\n\nThe tricky part is that he's finally saying he wants to change and suggesting couples therapy, but you've heard these promises before. And honestly? Sometimes when we've been let down repeatedly, it becomes almost impossible to believe change is real even when someone is genuinely trying.\n\nAs a relationship coach, I see this pattern a lot - one partner finally gets serious about changing when they realize they're about to lose everything, but by then the other person has already grieved the relationship and moved on emotionally. Neither of you is wrong in this situation (if he actually did finally get it), you're just in completely different places.\n\nThe question isn't really whether he can change (though that matters), it's whether you have any emotional capacity left to stick around and find out. And honestly, after 13 years of hoping and being disappointed, it would make complete sense if you didn't.\n\nHave you thought about trying individual therapy for yourself first? Sometimes getting clear on what YOU actually want (separate from what's best for the kids or what he needs) can help you figure out if there's anything left to work with. And also make sure whatever conclusion you come from is not coming from numbness, but real conscious choice where you are choosing yourself whatever that looks like, which makes any path forward feel more secure. \n\n\n\nFeel free to dm me if you want to talk through any of this more <3 you're so brave for finally wanting to prioritize and honor yourself you 100% deserve it.",

Case in point:\n\n>About a year and a half ago, my partner and I got into an argument and she told me that I’m “not doing anything to better myself”.\n\nDid this come out of nowhere? Or was it a \"straw that broke the camel's back\" sort of remark? Was your girlfriend maybe experiencing come caregiver fatigue when she said this?\n\n>So I asked her what she meant, and she said that I needed a therapist and medication (anti-depressants). She wasn’t aware that I was actively looking for a therapist, it just hadn’t come up.\n\nThis is so odd to me. If you're having serious enough mental health problems to have merited the argument you just described, why didn't you tell her you were proactively seeking a therapist? That seems like something your partner of all people should know about, especially if she's been supporting you through the ordeal.\n\n>Fast-forward to a few months ago, and we got into an argument and I had a psychotic break and threatened to kill myself. Clearly, this really freaked her out, and she was very upset, and I understand all of that\n\n...do you? Because holy crap. That would be relationship-ending for a *lot* of people, and not unreasonably.\n\n>When I was gone, she called her friend, who happens to be her boss, and I later saw a text between them where she told her boss I wouldn’t leave and her boss asked me if she wanted my partner to have her husband come over and drag me out by my hair. They were also calling me bipolar\n\nTo demean you? Or was this speculation about what could be causing the scary, erratic behavior you were admittedly displaying?

I believe your physical health conditions are real, and it's normal and common to suffer from poor mental health as a result of becoming disabled and having to deal with this shitty illness.\n\nI also think you're downplaying the impact of your behaviour on your partner. She may very well have behaved poorly, it's difficult to tell based on your post - but I'm telling you that either way, it doesn't sound like you're in a good place to be in a relationship. \n\nYou went out of your way to stress that you didn't threaten your girlfriend. That doesn't make it ok or any less serious that you made the threats you did. I know how dark it can get with this illness but you need to recognise that whether or not you intended it to be, that was abusive behaviour and she was right to ask you to leave. She told your friend you wouldn't leave because that was true. The way her friend responded wasn't kind but she was also probably worried for your girlfriend's safety and wellbeing. \n\nYou also don't a say in how your girlfriend communicates with her friends. You get to say that you don't want to be in a relationship where you discuss your problems with people outside the relationship, that's a boundary that you can enforce by leaving. That's about your behaviour. But trying to stop her venting to her friend about the way you're behaving towards her is controlling and an attempt to prevent her from relying on her support network. She needs that more than ever right now.\n\nIt sounds like your girlfriend is poorly informed about bipolar disorder and quite possibly being insensitive in calling you that. But by the sound of it she isn't saying it to demean you, that's all you're inference, and I think it's more likely she's saying it because she's trying to get you to see the profound effect of your poor mental state on both of you, and to convince you to take it more seriously. You're getting hung up on this idea that she's \"demeaning\" you instead of trying to understand what she's trying to communicate to you.\n\nI don't think you've treated this situation with the seriousness and urgency it needs. You've said you didn't take her seriously enough for what sounds like quite a long time and you need to take accountability for that. You don't deserve to have to live with these illnesses or the toll they take on your mental health but you are still responsible for the way you treat your partner. You're upset that your partner accused you of not looking for help soon enough only a day or two (by your own description) after you starting looking for a therapist. I get why that would feel shitty when you're trying. But how long had she been waiting for you to get help before that?\n\nIf you want to repair your relationship, you're going to have to step back and take some accountability.",

But someone who struggles with it in a heavy way, there is going to be consequences on the relationship as a result. Its not easy being in a relationship with someone who as she said \"refuses to help themselves\"\n\nYes, even though you were actively working on it. Maybe it wasn't aggressive enough, or long overdue, something like that might be missing in this story.\n\nIf she was encouraging you to go into therapy, then hit a breaking point... Why did you wait until last minute to let her know you were looking into it? Because when you keep it a secret like that, it just comes off like you're saying it to save your ass in the conversation but haven't actually looked into it. Your partner is going to want to see genuine progress and effort, but you kept that hidden for some odd reason.\n\nI wouldn't be surprised if there was an underestimation on how much its impacted her relationship experience when she had to play the therapist/patient role instead of gf/bf roles over the years. Especially with the recent psychotic break, to threaten yourself like that. That is far above the GF's paygrade and not something she is equipped to handle.\n\nDue to that, if you are difficult to manage in a relationship. Your partner is probably going to turn to their friends to seek her own support and vent on their struggles because they are in fact struggling with the relationship themselves.\n\nMind you, the bosses comment was way over the line and unnecessary. However, she can't control what other people say. She didn't know that's what would be said next. How did she respond to it?\n\nAnother missing detail. Together for 3 years. Living together. Severe mental health issues and struggling to work go hand and hand. What's the deal with your performance at work and job? Because if you have been struggling to work, resulting in her carrying more financial load, that is another contrubuting factor of difficulties thrown onto the fire.\n\nAnd finally, I fail to understand how someone saying bi-polar is insulting? You had some mood swings, some may assume that. Its not an insult to try to make sense of erratic behaviour like that.\n\nI feel like there is some of this going on:\n\n>I have been difficult for her to deal with for a long time that I underestimated. Oh, she brought some small parts on her side that I find difficult even though I created the lead up in the first place. She's been patient with me, but I can't offer the same grace for her.\n\nAnyways... Maybe if this relationship is causing you more grief than peace, adding more difficulties to your struggles. Its not the one to be in.\n\nSeems like being in this relationship is doing both of you more harm than good. Creating an environment where its more difficult for you two to find your own peace of mind. And you obviously need to fight for your peace of mine. So, maybe it would be best to get out of the fire and start taking a different approach in life where you have less problems to deal with.",

You don’t have to be super concrete, my therapist advised me to say: “I really liked what happened, I’d like to do it again, but I don’t want to pressure you. I think we understand each other and we have a good friendship and I hope that something will grow between us when the time is right.” \nNobody has ever gotten angry or upset hearing something like that. \nA couple of things can happen: \n1) he agrees and you start dating \n2) he disagrees and you try to stay friends, you are sad and it’s awkward for a while but that’s not so different from how it is now. It will totally pass. \n3) he disagrees and his reaction cures you of your crush (this is what happened in my case. My friend was so avoidant about the whole thing, he was clearly lying to himself and it was so unattractive to me and it was sad for like 2 days but now I’m okay, I know he’s not right for me but I didn’t let anything fester and our friendship will recover in time.) \nBeing honest with him will teach you something about him, about yourself and it is also a gift to yourself to express your desires. \nGood luck! \nPS: If you are regularly so unsure of what you want that you freeze, you may benefit from some therapy.

It is also very difficult to deal with long distance, even when everyone is doing everything \"right\". Your husband may be hurting and may have reacted from a place of emotional pain. Did you at least talk to him about it in a way that would allow him to make adjustments to accommodate you? If you've been in pain for months, surely you warned him that canceling was likely, regardless of what a doctor said, right?\n\nBased on your ages, I'm guessing (and please point out if I'm wrong) that you both have limited vacation time and limited resources for planning trips to see one another. Those constraints can make it feel much harder to be flexible (and more frustrating when precious time together is taken away.)\n\nWhen was the last time your husband was physically with you? Video chatting is nice, but after a while, a hug and some eye contact really make a difference. \n\nDid you and your husband find a way to reschedule the Christmas trip? Repeated let downs are hard to handle, even if they're unavoidable. \n\nHow long are you going between in person visits? My and my husband's limit was 8 weeks. We did 12 weeks once and that wasn't good for us. That said, different couples need different things. I know couples who went much longer stretches, but they also spent significantly longer with each other in person before the next stretch of long distance. \n\nI'm not saying you're wrong or that you did the wrong thing. I'm just sharing some thoughts for your consideration. I've done long distance  and made it through to the other end. At one point, I canceled plans because of illness, but at a different point, I chose to take a very long, very uncomfortable trip, because it was worth it to me to have my husband wrap his arms around me and tell me that everything was going to be okay.",

I understand that you said he is part of the wedding party, but his wife having a tumour should trump that. \n\nSecond question is why he didn’t come to see you at Christmas when you couldn’t go to see him.

Take her off your insurance, don't ride with her, don't let any children ride with her, etc. She needs to cover all the costs related to her vehicle and insurance. If she needs to drive for work, that's for her to figure out. Don't screw up your own insurance and risk your job because she isn't willing to do the work. What happens if she's in a wreck and seriously injures herself or someone else? She won't be able to work and you might not be able to afford insurance after that, eliminating your income as well. \n\nSupport her if she's willing to take some classes, but make sure they're behind the wheel with an instructor and not virtual or classroom based.  \n\nThat being said, have any conversions happened about why she's not willing to address anything with her driving? Maybe she really is just a horrible driver, but I'm wondering if there's something else she's worried about. Is her vision poor?  Does she have vertigo? Is there something else she might be more worried about than the poor driving record that she's avoiding?",

It may seem a little harsh but it's honestly the kindest thing you could do for her at this point. She's gonna feel however she needs to. If she starts trying to guilt trip you or manipulate you just walk away and leave it at that.",

I can also relate to being hit on but not noticing it at all, I just try to be nice to everyone no matter how they interact with me. For reference, I’m a 5’ 11” black guy from the UK while my gf is 5’ 1” and lives in (and is from) a south east asian country.\n\nI visited her for the first time last October and it was amazing. What I did notice though was that we would get a decent amount of attention, most likely due to being an interracial couple in a country where it isn’t exceedingly common or because I was just taller than the majority of people that I saw. I never had a negative experience, it was mainly people just staring for a couple seconds too long or people being super friendly and talkative, which I didn’t mind at all. \n\nWe went to grab a meal and do some shopping in shopping centre but when we got back to her car, I noticed my gf was being kinda quiet. I asked her what was wrong and she said she didn’t want to be over dramatic but after a little bit of pushing from me, she admitted that she felt kind of bad because the employees at the restaurant (who were all women), were clearly hitting on me and I was still being super friendly with them. \n\nI apologised and said that I hadn’t even noticed, to which my gf said that she knows I wasn’t reciprocating anything but she just felt upset because those women were clearly flirting right in front of her face. I asked if there was anything else on her mind and she asked if I really didn’t notice anything during our little outing. When I asked her what she meant, she laughed a little and said that she found it cute how oblivious I can be. \n\nWhen I asked her to elaborate, she told me that there were at least 4 or 5 occasions in which I was being flirted with/ garnering attention from women but I didn’t notice at all. I told her that I had only noticed one time, which was when we were approaching a store with (only) female employees. I saw one of them grab two of her friends and start pointing in our direction while they started giggling but I had initially just assumed that there was something going on behind us. \n\nMy gf mentioned that she had also noticed that but she had overheard the women talking about us as we walked past their store, essentially saying that they thought I was cute and that it was romantic that I was carrying my gfs handbags for her. \n\nThis is just a super long winded way of me saying that it’s completely normal for your partner to get a little jealous/ upset when you get hit on (and especially when you act nice to the person) but it’s up to you to ensure that your partner can completely trust you to maintain boundaries and respect for your relationship. \n\nDo I think it was wrong of you to talk to this woman? No.\n\nDo I think it was wrong to still keep talking to her after she had expressed flirty behaviour and especially after she had insulted your gfs country, as well as talking with her on the commute back home? Most definitely. \n\nWhether you did it intentionally or not, you demonstrated a lack of respect for your gf and your relationship by staying friendly with this woman after she threw shots at your gf.",

In this particular instance, planning was needed.  It isn't possible to attend a concert that requires travel and hotels without planning.  Because he didn't plan appropriately AND he didn't tell her that he needed her to check his work for mistakes, they both missed out on his gift that she had been looking forward to for a year.  \n\nMy man has never been a planner and I am.  If I'm setting up the date, I get us tickets in advance, I know the transport links we'll be using, I have an idea (and usually a reservation) at an appropriate restaurant nearby.  When he sets the date, he has a vague idea of what he wants to do and he wants to be able to sort of drift as the fancy takes him/us.  And that is fine.  We alternate who does the date planning and we plan to the level we each like; the other gets on board with it for that go round.\n\nBut what I've noticed is that he has started to recognise that planning can smooth some issues that impulsivity can bring up.  Now, when he wants to do a special date, he plans it.  He thinks it through and crafts the necessary details.  If there are choices to be made, he might ask me which I prefer, but generally, he gets on with it.  And he has planned some lovely dates.  On the flip side, I'm now myself more inclined to set a date which is \"come over and we'll see what we feel like doing as the day goes on\" and enjoy it completely.\n\nFor me, the question is always about what kind of match are you.  Are you and your man the kind of match who enhance each other's strengths?  Do you each learn from and develop with the other?  Or does it feel like an unshared burden because your strengths are taken for granted and no one develops with you?\n\nIf I was years into a relationship and my man had never picked up anything from me--and I had picked up nothing from him--I wouldn't consider it a viable relationship.  I don't want to do all the planning for ever and ever; I don't want to \"check\" on the work of my partner to see if he's done it right, like I'm the class monitor.  And I am quite sure my partner wouldn't want to always be dictated to by someone who couldn't let him sometimes enjoy his natural style.  Are you a match?  Or just together?",

So, they searched everywhere. Garbage cans, ripped the house apart, etc.\n\nUltimately, it is likely my mother threw them in the garbage during a cleaning spell. This would not be the last important thing she ever threw out. \n\nOver the years, the REM ticket lore grew. “Where is the xyz?” “It’s with the REM tickets.”\n\nThis was 20 years ago. My mother has habitually done this type of thing and my dad now stores all important items in our home. They’ve been married 45 years.\n\nAt 65, my mother learned she has ADHD.

But with my ex I was always responsible for everything (even his uni enrolling, which is crazy, I’m not someone’s mom to control if all the documents were sent). We broke up right after one of the trips, because I was so tired just being around him and thinking of everything for him. \n\nWith my current boyfriend, we had a situation, where we missed our transfer flight. After 10 hours in airport. It got changed several times and we thought that they sent us a boarding time instead of actual take off time and, of course, we went there last minute (we are both too much of type B). But instead of anger or disappointment we basically laughed, said that we are a bit stupid and that those 10 hours drained us. And while he was talking to the help centre as for what can we do and where do we get our suitcases back, I was looking for buses to our actual destination and hotels in city we got stuck. Just to finish a story, we got our stuff back and went by bus and the next morning we already were where we planned to go.\n\nThat said, I just wanted to say that it’s all about a person you are with. About approach. If there are lots of stuff that annoy you about your partner, then maybe it’s not a right partner. Not everything is always perfect, but if you are willing to stay and try and forgive, that’s what matters. And if you don’t, then just leave. It can be hard, but maybe there is someone more compatible for both of you. Everyone makes mistakes, but if those mistakes can drive you crazy, then you are probably already angry with the person you are with, and that’s not good for relationships. Try thinking if that’s just how your responses are or if that’s just your feelings for your partner vanishing. That’s really important to be able to answer that for yourself.",

You have a little life in your hands now and that's far more important than anything your sister's ever done. Maybe don't take the bait on this. You don't have to cut her off completely since that would probably create more familial friction. But you absolutely have to stop taking everything she says seriously.

Very calmly say that was very rude. Why would you say that? And then do that every time. \nEither way (or a combination of these), you have to set your boundary. No one should ever speak to you that way, especially not a family member. You also want to set a good example for your child. \n\nAnd side note on the formula, people will question you on parenting decisions always. Calmly tell them that you are the parent and you make the decisions for your family and with your doctors support and guidance. They need to bug off.

If she does not confess, tell her you are not an idiot and will not allow her to treat you as such. Then stop engaging with her until she’s ready to be honest. Look up grey rock method and Apply it until she’s ready to be honest. Divorce should be on the table, she needs to be aware of this. You need to be strong and not cave, no matter what. \nIf you can afford it, hire a pi for the wedding and hold off the confruntation until after s-o you have the full information.

She said she knew I was going and had already checked my calendar and knew I had the week off. She knew I was lying about work . She thought I was just joking around. I told you guys she’s smart. I still maintained a serious face and basically told her I’m still not over it and still have some feelings of her cheated. She hugged me and said I’ve known her all my life if i think she would cheat on me. I told her she acted weird and her excitement just threw me off. She said if it makes me happy she will cancel the wedding and we don’t have to go. I still did not want to give in so I said I researched about a private company that you can take a lie detector test. Would you be willing to do that. She got very upset and said she can’t believe I will go that far that if I’m really concerned that she cheated and unhappy in the relationship then I can do what I want but there’s nothing more she can do about it because it never happened. She left the home and went to stay by her mom. I’m home alone , I tried calling her but she won’t answer. I think she’s upset and hurt. I think a break would do me good. I have to think about it.

Many people use it occasionally for a party or night out without experiencing any real addiction.

Why are you allowing this to happen?  Why are you not setting boundaries? I get that you were unemployed (but aren't anymore), but there's a difference between maintenance cleaning and being a slob and not cleaning up after yourself.  Don't accept that.  I digress.\n\nAs for the kids, why is HE allowing this?  Might be his job (which he doesn't do), but again, why is he allowing this?  I get that you obviously don't want to leave a mess, but this needs to be addressed.  You shouldn't accept that either.\n\nNow you're working full time, and the house is a mess.  As such, it's time to set expectations regarding cleaning.  Of course no one wants to do chores.  But guess what?  Life happens.  Anecdotally, my wife and I both work full time (as is the situation with many others now), and we make time to ensure the house is clean.  It's essentially just something you need to do as an adult.  It might suck, but you do it.\n\nI wouldn't bring up ADHD, so I'm not sure why you're jumping to that.  It's not that complicated.  He's just fucking lazy.  So again, stop making excuses and saying you're fine with this; you're not, and you shouldn't be.  It's ok to be honest about that.\n\nSo the answer here is you talk to him and set boundaries and expectations.  In no world is it overstepping to want a clean household.  I agree that you shouldn't be cleaning up after them.  They should be cleaning up after themselves, but what they logically don't clean up can be decided between the both of you, not just left to him because he's their father.  It's YOUR home.

He started showing off pictures of me to his friends, and I visited a few of them and felt like a show piece. It was uncomfortable. I'm neurodivergent and very socially awkward, and when I wasn't fitting in with one group and failing at the interaction, he expressed his displeasure by calling me something quite nasty\n\nYour husband is into himself and his own needs, no matter how it might make you feel. This could be potentially damaging to your relationship at this particularly difficult time. If you can get marriage counseling soon, please do it. There's a possibility he's too wrapped up in his own world to realize what is going on. This might be a way of dealing with the stress of twins and a wife going through recovery.

He let you make that committment, KNOWING that you didn't have all the information. He literally tricked you into marrying him, and in my opinion, that committment is now void.\n\nThe second is that he's going to do this again. It's part of who he is. He's likely done it in past relationships, he's likely done this your entire relationship. He probably kept several \"on hold\" as backup. And he likely blocked every girl he was talking to right before your wedding because he's convinced himself it's time to stop. But he won't be able to. The first time you're sick. Or you piss him off. Or you're too tired to give him attention - what do you think he's going to do? The same thing he has ALWAYS done - run to get attention from someone else.\n\nBut the main thing is that he lied to you and LET YOU MARRY HIM without him being honest. For me, there's no coming back from that. I would leave immediately, divorce, and move on. None of this is your fault, but there's no future with someone you will never be able to trust. You need trust to have a life, to build a family and you can't ever have that with him now.\n\nIt's over. Grieve, but end it.",

Love doesn't mean tolerating this childish garbage from a grown man.  \n\nHe needs to quit thinking that being married to him is a treat, it isn't. Here is a something I didn't learn til I was in my 30's: they will never change for you, for your children, or to save your marriage.  **A person will only change when they decide it is the time to change.  Whether it's to improve their overall life, or to become a better partner, they won't do it until they want to.**\n\nYou and your baby girl deserve so much better and you need to model this behavior to her that putting up with crap like this is unacceptable.  If he won't leave, pack your things, take your baby and leave.  Remember: you deserve better and so does your daughter!",

I'd say something along the lines of asking how he has been, and that on your side you have figured out what you needed and are in a much better place now. And that if he is interested, you'd love to catch up with him because this time apart also made you appreciate how much you miss him in your life.\n\nThen the ball is in his court. He'll know exactly where you stand and it will be his choice whether he is ready to try again or not. If he is you will need to have a heart to heart talk about what happened and how you plan on handling this type of situation in the future before they keep growing to the point of impacting your relationship. \n\nAgain, personally, I would not wait until after your trip.

I'm around that age too, and can say that this guy is likely just looking for a person that's nice, sweet, considerate of others, and not mean or manipulative. If that's you, then u got this haha.\n\nHonestly as a man, the lack of dating experience is a huge plus. That means that you were not going around playing with mens emotions, dating multiple men at once, and destroying them by cheating on them (like many modern American women.).That would show that you are way less likely to cheat and manipulate.

I don't think lying is a particularly good foundation for a relationship, but as far as lies go this is generally pretty mild.\n\nPersonally, I would encourage you to be a bit more honest with any prospective partners as vulnerability is the only real path to true connection and ultimately you want a partner that likes you for you, not the idealized version of yourself that you're working hard to pretend exists. \n\nThat being said, I totally understand your hesitation and I can't say I blame you for wanting to play things close to the chest.\n\n> I feel like if I got over my depression, I would be sent right back to it once I try to date and realize that I have no common ground with anyone?\n\nI don't believe that's truly possible, but I can understand how it might feel that way. The human experience is itself inherently common ground and there are plenty of people out there that never dated because they were focusing on their career, taking care of a sick relative, etc.\n\nYou're definitely going to run into a lot of assholes while trying to date and not everyone is going to ultimately be compatible with what you want out of a romantic relationship, but that doesn't mean there isn't someone out there for you. You are not inherently unlovable.\n\n> Am I thinking too much into it?\n\nKinda. The reality is that no one has any idea what the hell they're doing most of the time. Everyone is different and being in a previous relationship might help you in a future one, but it might not, so I wouldn't worry about it. You've got to start somewhere.",

Believe me, you will see night and day how different it feels. \n\nMy ex was like your bf, and he refused strongly to do anything 'cute' or 'romantic.' He was also stingy with words of affirmation, which I really wanted from a partner. But unfortunately for me, I didn't have confidence and thought myself unworthy so I was with that guy for 6 years, basically 'begging' for scraps of 'love.' Then the last year of our being together, I noticed that he was capable of being sweet and considerate. But not toward me, just toward his other friends (who happened to be women). I stopped justifying his poor treatment of me and his unwillingness to act considerate and sweet toward me. \n\nNow I'm married to a guy who wouldn't hesitate to reassure me, he's thoughtful, considerate in manners that I enjoyed. We've been married for more than 2 decades. My advice to you? Stop dating this one, and start dating guys who are more 'your type' (the ones who can 'speak' your love language).",

And that depends on how long it's been going on. \n\nY'all are young, we all know marijuana has some effects that can positively help (with nuance, of course). \n\nMy best suggestion is to be supportive but firm on your stance. I also went through some things and relied heavily on marijuana for a time, and my partner sitting me down, telling me they loved me but it was detrimental to our way of living financially, and they understood but we needed new measures of having grief (at the right time), was what I needed. \n\nBe supportive, pick your battle at the right time, and remember you love her. I can tell by the post you are on her side and just worried, just make sure that comes across when you confront it. It's you two against a problem, not you vs her and the problem.",

Remember that just as you're learning what you can and can't do and how far you can push it, your wife is doing the same, although without the benefit of being able to feel how this affects you like you can. Having dealt with something similar for the last decade, I can offer you two pieces of advice: don't push yourself beyond sustainability and look into spoon theory.\n\nI understand the choice between exhaustion and frustration, and the key for me has been learning to redefine fulfillment. It means accepting that the amount of things I can do in a day are different than they used to be and differed from what many others can do. I've had to learn to prioritize and go day by day, and with your talk of managing your health, it sounds like you've been making a good start on this.\n\n[Spoon theory](https://www.mitoaction.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/BYDLS-TheSpoonTheory.pdf) is a great way to explain what it's like to be disabled to someone that isn't. It's a useful shorthand, since I can tell my partner that today's a 'low spoon' day and he understands that I may not be capable of much that day. In your case, you could remind your wife that you only had spoons for dinner *or* the garden, but not both.",

He is a selfish and unkind and does not deserve you love or attention. \n\nFind a therapist, allow yourself to feel angry and sad because someone you love(d) betrayed your trust and doesn't care. Put the energy and time you have towards something that would better serve you -try out classes (gym, art, hobby), visit friends or family who live out of the way for a weekend, do things that you want to do that are fun for you e.g. going out dancing, or gaming, or that you think might be fun e.g. if you see a poster for \"big red tractor day\" at your local park, go see the big red tractor.

I hope you don’t want to change to appease someone else while you have to suffer because you feel it’s your duty. I have a big history of sexual trauma also, my current relationship is the “healthiest” I’ve had (I’m not mistreated) but the sex was plentiful to start and slowly died off to now I can’t even remember the last time. Is it unfair to the partner who is not sexually satisfied, yes ofc but sex must be consensual with two (or more, no judgement💅🏾) willing parties! I definitely don’t think it’s normal to have a sexless relationship unless if both people are asexual then yeh perfect. I think you have to communicate and work together here. \n\nYou have valid medical/physical reasons why you can’t/don’t want to. Unless that’s resolved I’m not sure the way forward. For the mental block, I would suggest therapy to try and resolve your own trauma but to also find ways to connect with your partner that may eventually lead back to a natural connection. Sometimes we have needs that aren’t being met that makes us not want to be intimate. But I mean, who am I to give advice ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",

        "body": "Hi. What you’re feeling isn’t irrational, and it’s not an overreaction. It’s the natural response to a situation where your efforts, needs, and boundaries haven’t been treated with the respect they deserve. You started this relationship with openness and genuine intention. You met someone you clicked with, someone who made you laugh and feel excited; and you gave that a chance. You were drawn to Stephanie because she seemed sweet, funny, and interesting, and you leaned into those good feelings. But now, a few months in, you’re carrying the weight of unmet needs and emotional exhaustion. That kind of fatigue doesn’t just show up overnight. It builds slowly, in moments where you’re giving and not receiving, listening and not being heard, trying and still coming up short; not because you’re lacking, but because something fundamental in the relationship isn’t mutual. It’s totally okay that things felt great in the beginning. That’s often how it is. New connections can be exciting and full of potential. But what matters just as much-if not more-is how the relationship grows once the honeymoon phase fades. What you’ve described is a relationship that moved too quickly without enough space to breathe or check in. From the very start, you were pulled into deeper levels of commitment (meeting her family, saying „I love you,“ being the one to drive everywhere; all within a very short time.) You were pushed into fast-forward, and now you’re left catching your breath while trying to make sense of what’s happening. There are so many small red flags that, when added up, become overwhelming. The driving alone is a constant source of pressure: she doesn’t have a car, so the responsibility always falls on you. It’s not just that you pick her up. It’s the early-morning demands, the lack of appreciation, and the frustration she throws at you if you’re not perfectly on time. That pressure, on top of being a relatively new driver and not feeling safe on highways, adds layers of stress that she seems unwilling to acknowledge. Her reaction to your driving boundaries (getting mad that you don’t want to go all the way into the city) shows not only a lack of understanding, but a lack of care for your comfort and safety. Then there’s the emotional imbalance. She wants to go out constantly, while you need downtime to recharge. That’s not an incompatibility by itself (lots of couples navigate differences in energy levels); but it is a problem when one person refuses to respect the other’s needs. You’re not lazy or boring for wanting time to yourself. You’re human. And being with someone who dismisses that basic need doesn’t just create conflict, it makes you feel invisible. The way she talks to you is another deep cut. Joking at someone’s expense only works when there’s mutual understanding and emotional safety, and her comment, (If I’m so picky, why am I dating you?) is more than just a joke. It’s hurtful. Being told to „shut up“ when you say something she doesn’t like? That definitely crosses a line. You’ve been clear that this hurts you, and she brushed it off by saying, „I’m not used to a sensitive guy.“ That’s not an explanation. That’s an excuse. She’s telling you, in essence, that your feelings are a problem for her, rather than seeing them as part of a healthy emotional life. And that’s a dangerous message to internalize. You’ve already done the mature thing: You’ve communicated. You’ve brought your concerns to her attention. You’ve tried to clarify your intentions when you did things like suggesting she wait at a coffee shop so she wouldn’t be stuck in a hot car. You tried to be thoughtful, and she snapped at you for it. You took initiative with gifts, asked questions about her life, made the effort to connect (and she gave you 25 cents and one-word answers in return). These aren’t just isolated incidents. They point to a pattern where you are showing up consistently while she meets that effort with disinterest or even contempt. What’s especially heartbreaking is how alone you feel in this. Not just in the relationship, but in how you have to present it to the outside world. You’re keeping up appearances for friends, family, even your own parents (lying when they ask if you’re excited to see her, pretending everything is fine). That’s not just stressful. That’s isolating. You’re carrying the burden of this relationship and the responsibility of hiding your unhappiness, which adds a whole new layer of exhaustion. And yet, you’re still trying to hold space for the good parts. That says a lot about who you are. You’re not the type to just throw something away. You’ve noticed the sweet things (the crafts, the occasional moments of care when you’re overwhelmed), and those glimpses of love make everything even more confusing. But here’s the hard truth: A few kind gestures do not outweigh a pattern of emotional neglect, disrespect, and imbalance. They don’t erase the fact that you feel drained, small, and unheard most of the time. That constant question (What if I just try harder?) is something people in one-sided relationships ask themselves again and again. It’s a quiet form of self-blame that sneaks in when your emotional needs aren’t being met. But this isn’t your failure. You’re already trying harder than anyone should have to. And trying even more won’t fix something that she’s not willing to work on with you. You shouldn’t have to fight this hard just to be treated with basic care and respect. It’s not wrong that breaking up feels complicated. It’s not cowardly that you haven’t done it yet. You’ve built shared memories, mutual relationships, a narrative that feels hard to untangle. And yet, underneath all that, your gut is screaming that something is deeply wrong (and has been for a while). The fact that she’s moving out of the country for college next year makes this even more bittersweet. It adds a ticking clock to something that already feels unsustainable. In your heart, you know it’s likely to end. The question is whether you keep holding on out of guilt and momentum or whether you choose to let go now and give yourself space to breathe again. You’ve done your part. You’ve been honest, present, and generous. But this relationship is asking too much and giving too little in return. You don’t need to wait until you collapse. You can decide now (with compassion, not cruelty) that this relationship has run its course. And if you decide to break up, you’ll still be the kind, thoughtful, emotionally aware person you’ve always been. Leaving doesn’t erase the good times. It just means you’re choosing not to sacrifice your peace for the sake of holding onto something that’s hurting you. You’re allowed to end this without needing a dramatic reason. Feeling this worn out is reason enough.",

It is also good to be able to have some interaction like that, and can keep conversation alive. Use headphones so you can have some privacy in your respective spaces.\n\nSecond...try to *not* be in constant contact. Let me explain.\n\nWhile it is tempting to use the boon of modern communications, it is easy to overload it. Sometimes, you need to have time to cool off and relax. Allow those times to happen naturally, and you won't have to push them.\n\nYou will also not be as unhappy if you don't start at a high level of communication that calms down over time. That is, be moderate to begin with; only use the full availability if there's something urgent or important.\n\nYou might even consider hand-written letters as a way to be in touch. It can be something personal and meaningful, something to look forward to. A good quality pen -- I'm a fan of fountain pens -- can make it an enjoyable experience.\n\nI'd also suggest that you both read the book *The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work*, by John Gottman and Nan Silver. Gottman did research on married couples and found behaviors that went with happy marriages, and other behaviors that went with marriages that ended in divorce. He talks a lot about communication and other things which make relationships work well.",

May not be a big deal, but I’d rather my man did that than not, he just had to prioritize paying it off. \n\nIf he’s making 80k now, he’ll probably be able to get close to the 100k range with the masters and if you both prioritize paying off that loan, ie living on your salary for 1 year after your masters, he can have that paid off in 1-2 years tops. That’s really not that bad, and it’s a good sign that he wants something better for himself. \n\nAnd contrary to your belief that he has a few years, no actually he doesn’t because once kids start coming in it’ll be that much harder, he should do it now and you both should come up with a plan for Paying it off if you plan on marrying, otherwise he should do the heavy lifting of figuring out how to pay it off.\n\nETA: another step would be to ask him what his plans are for paying it off, a step-by-step.

A masters that helps you leap ahead is worthwhile, especially if there's an incremental increase in salary from the get go, or a sharper trajectory.

If you love him, and he's your person, and he wants this, then trying very very hard to find a way of making it happen without taking on that debt is worthwhile.

I mean, both parents are basically dealing with their respective responsibilities at all times aside from the limited amount of sleep they get.\n\nYou aren't doing these things \"to help out\" you are part of this. You are a parent. It is your job to do all these things. It is strange to want praise, especially after admitting you were not pulling your weight during the pregnancy. explain why she should be thanking you for your \"help\" and praising all this work you're doing when it is literally what you signed up for when you decided to have a child?\n\nI think the way to fix this is to forget about video games for now, spend all your time doing what needs to get done. and stop making everything about you. the baby is the main focus. and do not forget that your wife, in addition to taking care of the baby all the time, is still recovering from a major medical event.

What you are doing is taking care of your adult responsibilities as a husband and father. \n\nI get that you need words of affirmation but there is little that’s less appealing than a man expecting praise for doing what he should be doing anyway. I am much more likely to express appreciation to someone when I can see them stepping up to do things with no expectation of thanks. Your wife wants a partner, not someone who thinks they’re doing her a favor in exchange for a pat on the back. I know you said you’re not doing things for the acknowledgement, but then you go on to say you’re really struggling without the acknowledgment.\n\nI think before meeting with a couples therapist, you need to see an individual counselor. Rather than seeing this as a relationship issue, you need to work through what made you distance yourself during her pregnancy, why your default to seeing her in pain is to shut her out instead of supporting her, and why you’re so in need of praise and external validation that you’re struggling with your very newly postpartum wife. Your first step to “fixing” your relationship is fixing yourself.",

They could be very helpful to you.\n\nFirst, forget the video games until kiddo starts school.\n\nNow: Your wife NEEDED you. \n\nGrowing a baby is work. It can be painful. Scary. Everything around you is changing because people relate to you differently. Your hormones are whacky. Your body is changing. Your immune system is backing down so it won’t attack the fetus, so your body is vulnerable to disease, and it knows this. The tendons are softening so your bones can separate to let the child out of your pelvis. So it doesn’t work right anymore. You are wobbly when you walk andunsteady, and feel like you could fall down at any minute. You feel very vulnerable. Things can happen. Everything from gestational diabetes to preeclampsia. The core of your being knows that some women do not survive pregnancy.\n\nOther than infancy and early childhood, this is the time, when you most need the people you love to protect, nurture, and cherish you. You need them in your corner, reassuring you. You need your family to create a safe space for you and to pick up the burdens of daily life so that you can focus all of your energy that you can bring to bear on safely birthing this new human.\n\nIn some so-called primitive cultures, the young mother is surrounded by family who care for her and the infant for the entire first year. Relatives and friends bring food to the young family so that the parents can bond with the infant. \n\nIt will take several months for your wife’s body to recover. There is a reason that in a number of cultures pregnancy is considered to last a full year, nine months in the body, and three months outside.\n\nIt sounds like you do not have a support network to care for all three of you. I’m sorry that you don’t, as such a network might have made it much easier for you during the pregnancy and first month. \n\nI reiterate: In addition to your counseling, see if the hospital or birthing center that you used has a parenting group. Many of them have outreach services that could be very valuable in helping you during this vulnerable time.",

Yes. Is it easy? Hell no. It's more about asking yourself what you really want: She seems like she wants to stick with you and doesn't mind fighting if she has to. I think it's normal that you are not thinking about her all day, everyone processes stuff different. If I was always thinking about the people, the friends, the family and the relationships I left when I emigrated half the world away I would be depressed af. I love those people, but I cannot be all day thinking about them, I cannot stop living because of it.

That may have to be a norm to accept for some time. Even then, you two could try to schedule occasional times for romantic dates, so that you can prepare yourselves accordingly, while allowing the lazier, low-effort moments to fill the gaps.\n\n>He can be easily entertained for DAYS just with electronics, not doing anything. After waking up, when we eat, before going to sleep bla bla all the time. So I’m afraid when we live together he will stop appreciate me?\n\nYou could express this concern with him, and let him know you'd like for him to occasionally initiate efforts to be engaged with you, and he should recognize you'll also initiate efforts to engage with him. Just also recognize, though, that living in the same house with him also means that he's allowed to have downtime on his own. You two can work out finding a balance.\n\n>(the last one, bear with me) we are both very antisocial, so I am 100% sure he will only spend time with me and not any other person. I have SOME friends in the city but I don’t go out often. So I’m worried we’re just gonna get bored and less appreciative of each other\n\nTo an extent, moving in together does tend to mean that being around each other becomes the new norm for you. You'll have to shift your mindset to expecting emotions towards each other being not as high as they once were, since you'll be seeing each other during much more mundane, routine situations. But you two can maintain appreciation for each other simply by acknowledging each other's efforts and making that part of your regular communications.",

Moving in together following a LDR and never having dated IRL is skipping a step but that doesn't mean it's going to fail. You're both just going to have to understand that you don't know all that much about each other, especially when it comes to daily moods, likes, dislikes, etc. So it'll all be new. Maybe just be prepared to find out a lot of things you don't like. Prepare yourself to not freak out if you find that he leaves the toilet seat up or doesn't put the cap back on the toothpaste.

Sounds like you have a stressful job? And you clearly work hard to support your family so this is not me diminishing the work you do. However, you show up to work, and then you leave, when you’re off, you rest. \n\nStay at home moms are working every hour they aren’t asleep. Whether that be cleaning, cooking, planning, grocery shopping, watching the kids, teaching the kids, etc. There’s no breaks and it’s all within the confines of your own home. There’s no separation between work and home. There’s no place to escape to. You kinda lose your identity. It can feel very isolating, even more isolating if you’re struggling with depression. \n\nShe probably feels alone and overwhelmed. Burnt out. \n\nMaybe get her a babysitter for the day?

I couldn't imagine constantly holding back my feelings because someone else thinks they have it worse. Everyone suffers differently, but you need someone you can also vent to. Just because she seems worse than you doesn't mean your problems aren't real. You also need a safe space to cry, talk about your day, and laugh. Coming home/ walking through the door after a long day should make you feel as if a weight has lifted off your shoulders. She is making you add more pressure.

You shouldn't feel a need to see anyone's phone to make sure they aren't messing around on you, you're talking about trust being broken but that there is a sign you never trusted her, in the first place. I trust my girlfriend, I'd never dream of asking her to prove she is loyal. I trust that she is, without her needing to prove herself to me, and vice versa. I wouldn't particularly want her looking through my phone, not because I'm doing anything wrong but because it's an invasion of privacy, based on suspicion. That's a good seed to plant and grow into a toxic relationship tree. She's cheated on you, albeit not physically, but your own behaviour isn't really acceptable, either, imo, and a sign that you should probably work on your own trust issues before thinking about another relationship. If anything, this will just make them worse and make you more likely to become the sort of jealous arsehole that most women have met one of. \n\n\nNot a judgement by the way, I have always had my trust thrown back in my face before but I'd rather be a sucker than become the sort of guy who can't feel secure in a relationship unless I can monitor what my partner does and who they talk to etc. I understand the trust issues, absolutely, but I feel like it's probably a slippery slope to fall down and before long you'll be telling them what they can wear etc. It's not healthy whether your partner deserves the suspicion or not.\n\n\nGood luck though mate and I hope my words are taken in the spirit intended. ",

You’re having fantasies about being with other friends. That’s not a bonding proclivity. I wish you luck in figuring what you’re going to decide. There is way more time in front of you than behind you and you have a lot to learn. When people get burned they either learn from it and know not to do that again.

That was what you had to do, and as you know, if your partner doesn't truly want to get sober for himself, then he's not going to stay sober. Right now, you need to block him from your phone and focus on yourself. These messages are designed to keep you entangled with him, but at the moment, that's not healthy for either of you.

He was great when we were dating, then once we got married it was like a switch flipped. Started controlling money, making me feel like crap about myself, being lazy around the house but expecting me to do everything. Sound familiar?\n\nThe immigration thing makes it extra messy though. Do you know what your options are if you guys split? Like can you stay in the US or would you have to go back to Australia? That's something you need to figure out ASAP because it affects everything.\n\nHonestly, the comment about the annulment after your miscarriage would've been it for me. That's just cruel. And him complaining about your weight when you have PCOS? What an ass.\n\nI know you love him but he's basically turned into a different person. My first husband did the same thing - lazy, controlling, made me feel like shit about myself. I wasted 3 more years hoping he'd go back to how he was. Spoiler alert: he didn't.\n\nI'm with someone completely different now and the difference is night and day. You shouldn't have to beg someone to treat you decently.\n\nFigure out your legal situation first, then decide if this is really what you want for the rest of your life.",

He thinks he has you where he wants you because you don’t have a green card and he can control your life. Use that to your advantage and go home, leaving him behind.

That comment she made about her kissing you and you not noticing seems significant.\n\nHow often do you show your wife affection without any sexual intent?  Just sweet, loving affection not seeking anything more?\n\nIt may be that she is feeling pestered for sex in an environment where she no longer feels loved. This quickly becomes a vicious cycle. The more you press for sex, the less loved she feels, the more she resists, the more frustrated you get, the more you pressure and so on.\n\nEven discussing it is difficult. Because it is all bound up in \"why don't you desire me/why don't you love me?\" which is coruscating to our sense of self.\n\nAnd the problem is, once it's reached this stage, it's hard to bring it back because she is likely to see any new protestations of love as a cynical ploy.  Which is why the advice is nearly always to focus on deeds. Chores, childcare, date nights etc.\n\nBut I think you can't say \"I love you\" too often (assuming you still do) and just make a point of being affectionate in a non-sexual context.

Do you want to feel like a priority instead of waiting until 4am to talk to him?\n\nAsk yourself if you feel good about the way you’re being treated. Are you okay with being on the back burner?

When you don't live together, you can put a lot more effort towards the affection towards each other, and each of those interactions becomes a lot more passionate. It especially helps when you can schedule those meetings and interactions.\n\nBut when you live together, LOADS of your private, personal time is spent in each other's vicinity, including all of the unsexy moments in your day-to-day life. The broader association that you two have with each other as not just lovers, but roommates, can tend to reduce the significance of sex. You may need to adjust your expectations and find other ways to have your physical/intimacy needs met.\n\nThat's not to say that you're completely screwed. Things that can help:\n\n* Continue to schedule times for romance and sex. This can help you both mentally and emotionally prepare for the act, transition yourselves from being roommates to being lovers again.\n\n* Work out a pattern of honestly and respectfully communicating your interest to each other. This can help reduce the emotional impact of getting turned down, when you can fully recognize what her feelings are, and you know she recognizes yours as well.\n\n* Embrace self-love. Make sure you two can feel okay about DIY when your partner's unavailable (and same goes for any times she wants to DIY, too).\n\n>I will note she has always been on the implant since we started dating, and she started taking adhd medication a couple months ago when it really started to go down hill but that doesn’t explain the decrease over the last 9 months.\n\nYou sure? Hormonal birth control and changes in prescription drugs can absolutely affect libido.",

I know having access to intimacy and what you think you need to be happy being in someone else's hands can be really tough and really mess with your head, but it is what it is.\n\nYou've done the right thing in being clear that this is an important need to you, but if she doesn't want to act on that that's her choice, she's not obliged - you can accidentally imply that even if you don't mean to. Just be prepared to be told by some people online that you're not allowed to enjoy sex, or want and need it - it's not true, just have to find someone who wants it as much as you do.\n\nShe's not obligated to be your partner in sexual connection, but you're not obligated to be her partner at all. You just each have to decide what you're happy doing to be together. If they don't match, it's time to reconsider a purely platonic relationship which it sounds like is mostly what she's decided for you both, anyway.",

After the honeymoon passes, that's the reality of your relationship, when things are settled, not when infatuation is running the show.\n\nHowever, in saying that... Things shouldn't completely fall off. Maybe instead of daily sex, it turns into couple times a week sex sort of thing. But to fall off entirely, zero sex in months. A problem for long term compatibility.\n\nBalancing sex is tough. Because the more you beg for it, the less they want to give it. The more you attempt to initiate but rejected, the worse you feel. And suffocating your partner with frequent requests for sex can kill the magic it of it.\n\nReally is a tough thing to find the sweet spot where sex remains in a genuine and natural spot.\n\nAll I know... I rather be with someone where things are natural instead of having to beg for it. If its not natural then its incompatible. Long term relationships are so much easier when you're with someone who has the same drive as you, down to do it weekly all on their own instead of someone you have to fight about sex with.",

What you do have a right to do, is end the relationship if your libidos aren't compatible.\n\nNeither me nor anyone else on Reddit can identify the source of the issue, or whether it's just the fairly typical reduction in frequency that most people experience in long term relationships, without knowing a lot more about both of you. The reality is, you should consult an actual therapist. I know that doesn't feel helpful now, but realistically no one on the internet will be able to solve this for you.

As a woman who also struggled with losing my libido later in my relationship, I can say a lot of the time it's not clear, even to the one who lost their libido, *why* this happens - it can be all sorts of reasons - physical hormone imbalance, an unrecognized shift in relationship dynamic, etc. So even if you ask her about it, she may not even know the actual answer. Which is why it will take a lot more teamwork and analysis of feelings/dynamics in the relationship to understand and heal the situation.\n\nThere is an excitement that happens in the beginning of a relationship that exists when two people don't know each other well yet and fall in love/lust with the *idea* of a perfect version of one another. This is why sexual desire is so heightened. When you're together a while and you get to know each other deeply, you see sides of each other that may be irritating or unsexy. So \"being in the mood\" especially for women becomes much more of a complex equation, happening only when the circumstances are right, and things are going well in other aspects of the relationship. This is why people say \"relationships take effort\" - both partners need to put in the work to understand each other and find ways to recreate that spark and that feeling of courtship that happened in the beginning.\n\nIf you try to talk to her and she pulls the \"you'll be fine\" card again, and doesn't show any concern for how you feel, unfortunately I would say it's not a relationship worth being in. She needs to at least care enough to listen to you and try to figure this out together.",

Only 30% of women can O from PIV sex.  \n\n“If it’s not when she wants it doesn’t happen.“.… As it should be.  You rather never have sex, than wait for her to want it, because waiting for stars to align for that moment is too much for you?! Yes you have to wait for her to want it.

After that I was devastated and just like you, I was lying awake at night thinking about what could have been. But then I began to focus on what she did to me. She also had some other flaws too.

Explain your feelings to her using I statements and go from there. “Hey ______, when you post photos of your friends online and have previously posted past partners but you won’t post any photos with me, I feel __________. Can you help me understand your intentions behind not sharing photos of me/us?” \n\nDig more into your feelings on why her not posting is bothering you. Get to the root of that feeling just so you can understand yourself more. Are you afraid she is wanting to appear single and is possibly cheating on you? Do you feel not valued or loved because she doesn’t post you but does post other people she loves? Why is it important to you that she posts you? \n\nOther than this issue are you happy in the relationship and does she generally treat you well? If not, might be worth it to let this one go if she doesn’t seem to value/validate your feelings. Even if she doesn’t want to change and start posting you (again, you need to get curious and find out her why on this. It would be one thing if she never posted at all, but she posts with her friends. Don’t get mad or heated, approach with curiosity and openness and see where she’s coming from), she should at least be able to try to understand your feelings and not shut you down. A good partner usually has no problem helping you feel secure in the relationship and truly listening to you/your feelings. It is possible that if you’re anxiously attached there’s things you need to work on within yourself to not be “insecure” as she puts it. \n\nIf this were me in your shoes I would also wonder why she wouldn’t post me and would probably feel sad about it. I want my partner to be proud to be with me and show others. I get not posting right away until you’re settled in the relationship. Sometimes other people ruin things for you and you can keep things private and therefore there’s less drama if it doesn’t work out etc. But 2 years is a long enough time where I’d feel fine posting it and wanting others to know.",

He will go on taking advantage of you and disrespecting you. \n\nStop asking him to help you.  Tell him you feel disrespected. Unappreciated. Unloved. Taken advantage of. Used. Exploited. Less than. Not an equal. Tell him you're not putting up with this shit anymore. \n\nTell him he's a full grown adult and has household responsibilities just like you do. Tell him it's no longer acceptable for him to fail to meet those responsibilities.  He fulfills his responsibilities at work.

Not to be more attractive to your partner, but because *you* are so clearly unhappy in the body you have right now, and because it's affecting your ability to believe in your partner's attraction to you. Your self-image is making you less able to enjoy sex, and it's making you compare yourself to other women in an unfavorable way. If this can all be resolved by adopting some healthier habits, then do it. All the power to fix that part of the issue lies with you.\n\nThe rest sounds to me like you need to learn to communicate even when it's hard. You don't sound happy with the swinging lifestyle, but it also doesn't sound like you've discussed that unhappiness with your partner (or your disappointment in how he supported you during your abortion, or your fear of ending up in that position again, or...). If I'm mistaken and you've simply left those details out, then disregard that part of my advice.

That is stuff that ideally you can work with a therapist on, but also, talking with supportive friends/family/this partner or finding online support around those feelings would be my recommendation. It is one of the pieces affecting your mind wandering during sex, and it will likely take some work to unpack it and figure out what you need from yourself and your partner now and in the future. If this partner is receptive, I'd talk about this with them.\n\nI need to feel attractive to want sex, too. My standards I hold for myself are different than my partners' and I am still working on feeling more sexy as my body changes or I gain some weight, so I totally understand where you are coming from there. I also don't see sexual partners that way, physical looks beyond hygiene aren't really what I care about in my partners. Just to say, yeah, I can relate to this and I'm working on it myself, too. I also avoid for ways to put that insecurity on my partners. I'm dieting right now to get back down to where I feel sexiest, not because of my partners, but for myself. For better or worse, I intellectually would love to feel sexy with the added pounds, but I am also working on the physical part.\n\nI also need to feel connected to the person, and any long term relationship that requires us being able to share our feelings and feel safe.\n\nIt sounds like your partner finds you attractive, so it is really on you to let yourself feel attractive. It might be working on the shame and finding ways to feel sexy however you are imbodied, imagining yourself with the body you may feel sexy as (one of the things I do when I'm feeling self-conscious or less sexy), or taking steps to make your body the way you want it to feel sexy to yourself.",

But very few people have deep love for their mothers-in-law, hence an entire genre of standup comedy devoted to how awful MILs are. In terms of getting along enough that your partner isn't fighting a constant battle, always remember there's a time and place for being \"loud, \"opinionated\" and \"authentic\". At 65 she is who she is and that's not going to change. So maybe do what the rest of us married people do; \n\n\\- limit exposure to only those times when you have the mental energy to fake tolerance\n\n\\- remember that a smile isn't a promise and just because you don't pick a fight doesn't mean you're agreeing with her\n\n\\- practice the mantra 'he's worth it', 'he's worth it', 'he's worth it', because ultimately you're putting up the facade of pleasantness with her so your partner doesn't have to hear an earful about how horrible you are\n\nIt doesn't make you weak to just go along to get along. For better or worse marriage is a team sport and it's easier to accomplish things together if you're both pulling in the same direction. If that direction has to be mutually managing his mother then these are the things we do for our life partners. Don't ever put a romantic partner in the position where they feel they have to choose between you and their family.",

That grief looks different for everyone though. Once she grieves though, it will get better. I have a few thoughts now and then about how it would be different, how my baby would be 15 now, and while a little sad, it no longer sends me into depression, so I can tell you from experience, it does get better. The hard part is for her to figure out how to grieve the loss. Can she write about it in a journal? Can she confess to a religious person? Sorry, I'm not familiar with Buddhism, but is there a priest of sorts she can speak to? A therapist? A friend?

After two years, both of you deserve some grace. We do what we have to do, and sometimes those decisions have long reaching consequences we didn’t anticipate. I am over sixty now, but at 19, I had to make that awful decision. I still think about it sometimes. But if I went through with it, with a man I had lost all respect for as the father, I would not have my amazing daughter and my three gorgeous grandchildren. Life has a way of working out.

And some people are just not very good at maintaining them, as you are finding out with your fiance.  He says he still loves you and wants to marry you, but as for helping with the wedding planning and doing thoughtful, romantic things to stay in touch across the miles, you've been out of sight and out of mind.  However, if the move made sense in terms of building his career trajectory, it's an investment in your shared future.  If he's now living too far away to come back to visit you regularly, you could take a hotel room in an in-between location and arrange to meet him there on the weekends, so you can at least get some quality in-person time with him once a week.  That will make the distance easier to bear.\n\nWhat's the plan for after your marriage?  Are you going to move to his location, is he going to come back to yours, or will you move somewhere else together?  Or is this LDR going to continue indefinitely, even after the wedding?  I personally would not marry, and likely would break off the relationship entirely, if there was no concrete end date in sight.\n\nYour financial situation also presents some red flags.  Will he be obligated to continue to support his birth family after you marry?  How will that affect your ability to save for big-ticket items of your own, like a house, children, and travel?  This is clearly something you need to discuss with him more - BEFORE you get married.  I wish you well.",

You're not asking about whether to break up over him \"not being active\" - you're drowning in a relationship with someone who disrespects you, has zero emotional regulation, and honestly sounds pretty cruel.\n\nThe fitness thing? That's just the tip of the iceberg here. What really jumps out is how he yells at you during disagreements, says mean things when he's angry, makes fun of other people's appearances while being hypocritical about his own habits, and literally told you to \"GO TRAVEL BY YOURSELF THEN\" when you wanted to share experiences together.\n\nYou said something that really got to me - \"I feel like I'm losing bits of myself and he is dulling my spirit.\" That's your inner wisdom talking, and it's trying to protect you. When someone makes you feel smaller instead of lifting you up, that's not love working the way it should.\n\nI work as a relationship coach and I see this pattern a lot - people staying in situations way longer than they should because they're focusing on one specific issue (like the gym thing) instead of seeing the bigger picture of how they're being treated overall. Sometimes we do that because the full truth feels too overwhelming to face all at once.\n\nThe fact that you're even asking this question tells me you already know what you need to do. Your spirit is asking for permission to choose yourself again, to get back to that person who loves travel and staying active and deserves basic respect from a partner.\n\nYou don't need to fix him or wait for him to change.

Why would you want to maintain a friendship with someone you cannot trust?\n\nIf he's unwilling to show you documentation or someone else can't verify his hospital visits, you're not going to trust him, but frankly, the proof you're wanting is private information only for him, his doctors, his insurance (if this is in the United States), and people he wants to share it with.\n\nSo your choices are trust him at his word or distance yourself from him. Given what you've posted, I'd recommend the latter.",

Whatever his intentions were, you can let him know that his behavior was inappropriate, and has damaged your ability to feel affectionate towards him again.\n\nIf you have enough time to think it over, you could consider for yourself whether there's anything that can be said or done that'd help you feel prepared to trust him again with your feelings. If you have an idea or two in mind, share it with him, and get his buy-in. For instance, does he need to recognize why his actions were inappropriate, even if he didn't mean to elicit this feeling from you? If you take time thinking it over, but feel like your trust has been broken beyond repair, then I wouldn't see a point in getting back together with someone you can't trust.",

Now you understand how damaging pranks are. Ask him what his intention was. Let's hope it was payback and not something he truly found hysterical. And this needs to be the last of the juvenile bullshit. Because now you both know that scaring/hurting/damaging your partner for 'fun\" has lasting effects.\n\nYou can not claim the high road or any moral superiority. You did it to him. He may not have reacted externally the way you did, but don't minimize how much you blew up his world with your \"joke.\" Acknowledge that this is a bad thing to do to someone you love and let this be the end of it.",

You're on your own for it.\n\nBecause we spare each-other from the expectation that you have to pretend to be into something that you're actually not.\n\nHowever, there is some stuff we entertain for each-other.\n\nShe is a hip hop dancer, I support her work. Watch her shows. She's got a video she wants to show off, I will scratch her itch for her... But I am not going to become hardcore into it because its her thing, not mine. There still is a buffer in place. She comes to my hockey games occasionally to show support, but I know she doesn't really give a dam about beer league hockey, its just being nice. Except, that is more geared towards basic support rather than sharing interests.\n\nWhat we ultimately do is find stuff we both enjoy. Not going to force her to watch a horror movie when she hates the genre, we can find a different movie we both can like.

I have friends I can play my video games with and that's how I get my satisfaction.\n\nBut you don't want to invest in friends because you want a deep meaningful connection with a singular person, all weight dumped on them.\n\nExcept, the issue with that is... You're expecting him to completely adopt your personality when he has a personality of his own. You're not going to connect with your partner in every single area. People are too different to expect that.\n\nIf you had friends to discuss hardcore politics with, you would be going to them instead of dumping it on your partner since you have no one else to talk to about it.\n\nYou can't force someone to enjoy the same things you enjoy. That's why you make friends. And if you two can never find anything in common to enjoy together, maybe you need to find someone where there is more things in common naturally instead of struggling to find things in common.",

The reason that's important, is because if that issue or those issues weren't fixed, then nothing's going to change and you're in the same relationship that ended because of it.\n\nSecond, as it relates to the music, he's certainly entitled to like or dislike whatever music he likes or dislikes. But he can just say that.  Doesn't need to shit on it and you.  But you then told him how you felt, and he blew you off.  You're here saying you guess that was the end of the convo.\n\nWell, it was, because you decided it was the end, by not following up.  And to be clear, I get it; you likely stopped because you were taken aback.  I'm absolutely here on your side. But again, the conversation ended because you didn't follow up.  Also, him saying \"yeah\" should upset you.  That's him quite literally acknowledging being mean, but saying nothing after, like for example an apology.\n\nYou then later elaborate, and he makes excuses.  He's been mean to people all week?  That's not an excuse.  He can't figure out why?  Maybe it's time to talk to a doctor.  He was just in a bad mood in the car? Not an excuse, but why was he in a bad mood?  Thing is, from that we can make assumptions that he suffers from depression (and he likely does and as such he should talk to someone).  But what really stands out here is when he says he only likes to play his music in the car.  If that's the case, why didn't he? \n\nHe then needs to stay up?  Why the fuck can't he regardless? You weren't talking?  Did he bring that up?  The rest comes back to potential depression, but that has absolutely nothing to do with the issue originally brought up. So what he's doing is gaslighting you.  That's why it feels off. So how do you talk about it? You be direct. Good luck.",

Ultimately she is going to have to make a hard choice between doing what her racist parents want her to do, or standing up for her right to love whomever she wants.\n\nIt's a major milestone in every young adult's life, when they are finally self-confident enough to face their parents and insist on making authentic choices for their own life and happiness, even if the path they choose is not the path their parents would have chosen for them.  Sadly, some people never dare to risk their parents' disapproval until they are well into adulthood.  An unfortunate few will remain under their parents' thumb for as long as they are alive.\n\nYour friend is rapidly approaching that important crossroads, and she'll have to talk to her parents all by herself. The only help you can provide is to encourage her to decide one way or another about her BF, and assure her that whatever decision she makes, you will support her.",

A lot of us are good men.\n\nBut i'd be lieing if I said there arent some dominicans who fit this description. My parents and their sibilings immigrated int he 90s. Dominicans love to go to DR because normally the flight is close, pretty cheap depending on the month and the US dollar goes far. I have relatives who make trips every 6 months and live like kings for 2 weeks at a time. Unfortunately a good amount (not all and hopefully not most) do go down there and cheat. They bring their US money, act rich and many women who dream to be in the US are impressed by it. Some of my relatives have cheated on their spouses because they do business trips down there but make sure to hangout with their sidepiece for a bit. \n\nBut I do think this is the case for many men/women regardless of race.

You need to understand that there's integrity in every job. In saying that, you're not a \"lesser\" person for working at a restaurant.  You also need to acknowledge that you seemingly weren't insecure about it until John left.  What changed?  I digress.\n\nNext, you need to understand that friends don't give a flying fuck about what you do from a friendship perspective.  They only care about who you are as a person and how you are as a friend. So how would you be a \"useless hump\" from a friendship perspective? What \"knowledge\" do you think you're expected to provide? What actions do you think are expected (that you're not already doing) that make you useless? There logically aren't any, and you know that.\n\nSo how you navigate this is to figure out what you want and go from there.  As for the friendships and your boyfriend's friendship with your friends, there's just objectively no issue there.  Good luck.",

        "body": "Oh wow, I can really feel the weight of what you're carrying right now. The jealousy you're describing makes so much sense, and honestly it sounds like you're being way too hard on yourself about having these feelings.\n\nWhat strikes me most is how you're watching everyone around you level up professionally and socially while you feel stuck in the same place. That's genuinely hard, especially when it's happening with people you love. And the fact that John now gets more access to your friend group because of his new schedule? That would sting for anyone.\n\nI think there might be two different things happening here. There's the immediate jealousy about missing out on time with your friends and feeling left behind. But underneath that, it sounds like there's this deeper fear about your own worth and place in the group. You mentioned feeling inadequate around them even before all this happened.\n\nHere's what I'm wondering though... have you talked to John about how isolated you're feeling? Not in an accusatory way, but just being honest about missing the connection you used to have when you worked together? Sometimes when people get excited about new opportunities they don't realize the person closest to them is feeling left behind.\n\nAlso, and this might sound random, but have you ever thought about what YOU actually want career wise? I know you mentioned not having a degree, but there are so many paths that don't require one. Maybe this is less about John's success and more about you feeling stuck without a clear direction forward.\n\nAs someone who works as a relationship coach, I see this pattern sometimes where one person's growth highlights areas where their partner feels stagnant. It doesn't mean anything's wrong with your relationship necessarily, but it might be a signal that you're ready for some changes too.\n\nWhat if instead of trying to stop the jealousy, you used it as information about what you're craving? More time with friends, professional growth, feeling valued for your unique strengths?\n\nWould love to chat more about this if you want to DM me. <3 I love how self reflective you're being here.",

        "body": "I can really hear the exhaustion in your words, and honestly, it sounds like you're carrying way too much on your shoulders right now. Eight years is a significant relationship, and it's completely understandable that you want to work through this together rather than just walk away.\n\n You're describing two separate issues that are probably feeding each other. There's the practical stuff (the fence, toilet, trash situation) but underneath that there's this bigger disconnect where you're feeling like roommates instead of partners. The staying up till 5-6am and sleeping till afternoon thing... that's not just a schedule difference, that's you both living completely different lives. \n\nI work with couples navigating similar patterns, and what I see happening here is that you've probably been the \"responsible one\" for so long that he's gotten comfortable letting you handle the emotional labor of the relationship. But now you're at a breaking point, and rightfully so. At the same time, it can feel \"wrong\" as if you're no longer \"supporting him\" but there's a difference between support, and enabling someone to stay in a pattern that isn't healthy even for themselves. \n\nThe defensive response when you try to talk about your needs? That's actually pretty common when someone feels overwhelmed but doesn't know how to communicate that without shutting down. Doesn't make it okay, but it might explain why conversations feel so difficult.\n\nHere's what might help: instead of focusing on the long list of tasks (which probably feels overwhelming to him too, and can make him feel unappreciated), maybe start with reconnecting first. Could you suggest one small thing you do together each week? Even 30 mins where phones/games are put away? Sometimes addressing the disconnection can naturally lead to more partnership in other areas.\n\nAlso, the work situation probably impacted him more than either of you realize. Some people respond to uncertainty by shutting down completely, which might be what's happening with the avoidance and gaming.\n\nYou deserve to feel heard and supported in your own relationship. and it sounds like he has some maturing to do in terms of his coping strategies at the very least, but this doesn't have to be the end of the world if we manage to tackle the situation as \"we as a couple tacking a dynamic that isn't working for one of us\" instead of \"you vs me\". Feel free to dm me if you want to talk through any of this more, sometimes it helps to process these dynamics with someone outside the situation.",

It's possible to emphasize to him that this is something that's important to you, without making any judgments, accusations, or assumptions about him.\n\nHowever, this isn't a surefire way to get him to change, and while this is a very impersonal method, I can't guarantee that he won't get emotional or shut down anyway. In which case, I refer you to my previous statement: you don't have to stay with him. Yes, a breakup is going to be likely to upset him, but his emotions aren't your responsibility to manage. It's understandable that you care about him and feel bad about doing something that you worry would make him sad, but continuing a relationship that you recognize isn't up to your standards (and doesn't show any signs of improving) isn't any better.",

Easy choice to dump.\n\nFriend two: Easy dump too. Took your belongings without asking. Borrowed money that was never returned. She pretty much stole your property. She took a jacket of yours without asking or permission. That's stealing, not borrowing.\n\nFriend three: Sounds toxic too. Not much information given, but sounds reasonable to dump.\n\nFriends four: Fair too. Seems to be extreme personalities to deal with, not my vibe.\n\nFriend five: Might have been able to sort your differences out and get along. But if you're fighting as friends, there is an expiry date for how long that should go on for. Maybe you can reach out to see if you two would be more mature this go around and spend more time getting along than fighting. She did extend an olive branch but you rejected. Oh well I guess, bridge is burnt.\n\nFriend six: Series of unfortunate events, can't do much about that. It is what it is.\n\nAnyways, some of these friends were certainly toxic and dump worthy. Sucks it felt like rapid fire. But friends 1-4 sound like easy calls. Friend 5, might have been some wiggle room to repair. Friend 6, not much you can do about that.\n\nWell... I guess its time to do what you can to make new friends. Join communities, hobbies, somewhere you see the same people routinely, try to make new friends who are healthy additions to your life.",

It sounds to me like you've realised you deserve some more respect than you were getting and have cut out the people who were consistently either putting you down or dismissing your feelings when you brought them up to them.\n\nAnd that's just it really. It doesn't like you're cutting them all off without having spoken to them about some of the things you're feeling. It just sounds like you feel you deserve better and need to put firm boundaries in place. I know when I left university I naturally went long-distance with my friends. When I realised the friendships were one-sided I stopped reaching out and expending energy on them. Hopefully you'll see it that way too - that you're not exhausting yourself in friendships where you don't feel respected.\n\nThat's my two cents on it :)",

That caused me to make bad choices with friends, jobs and partners. I can see where my own toxic behaviors blew up friendships. At some point in my life I seem to therapy and put in the work. I realized I was the person people kept around to feel better about their lives. I was also a big people please so was always around to do and pay for things. People took advantage of this but I also see how I was manipulative in the way I behaved like a push over to get people to like me. \n\nWe also naturally lose friends as our lives change. \n\nYou aren’t the issue here. None of these sound like good friends. That said, you attracted them in to your life through your actions and you kept them in your life. This is what you should look at and work on changing. \n\nI found that it’s very very hard to find friends who genuinely care about you and want you to be happy and succeed. My circle is very small now and at times I do feel isolated. At one point I had a group I could call to go out with at any point. I was always out and about. These were hollow relationships though. \n\nIn all women’s spaces you’ll hear women talking about feeling isolated when making changes like you are. Society makes us think we’ll have a circle of lifelong friends and we feel like we’ve failed or done something wrong when it doesn’t work out like that. \n\nYou spoonful self aware and like your growing and changing, which is exactly what you should be doing at 24.",

But you could suggest that your boyfriend talk to his own mother about maybe getting some hired help to come in. Even if she's perfectly healthy a large house and seven show dogs is a lot to deal with. The request for sleepovers likely stems from being lonely and maybe even feeling insecure in her home. So he could also encourage her to join some online dog fancier clubs so she has people she can communicate with in the evenings. In terms of her feeling safe he could make a day of installing cameras, making sure all her locks are functional, etc. There's a tendency for us to feel like anyone who displeases us is just crazy and unreasonable. But in most cases there are tangible things one can do to mitigate almost any circumstance.",

What you described isn't just toxic - it's abusive, and my heart honestly breaks reading what you went through that night.\n\nThe fact that you're questioning yourself shows how manipulative this situation was. When someone treats us badly and then apologizes afterwards, it creates this confusing cycle where we start doubting our own reality. But your instincts were spot on - someone asking for money for drugs, ignoring your physical pain during intimacy, and deliberately hurting you emotionally is showing you exactly who they are.\n\nThe emptiness you're feeling is so normal after leaving someone like this. It's not because you made the wrong choice, it's because your nervous system is recovering from being in constant fight or flight mode. Trauma bonds can make us feel attached to people who hurt us, which is why you might still have conflicted feelings even though logically you know he was terrible for you.\n\nYou didn't \"ghost\" him - you protected yourself from further harm. There's a difference. Sometimes disappearing is the healthiest boundary we can set, especially with someone who has already shown they don't respect our words or our wellbeing.\n\nAs somene who works with people through these kinds of situations, I can tell you that the confusion and self doubt will fade as you create more distance and heal the relationship with yourself. Right now focus on being gentle with yourself and maybe consider talking to someone professional about processing what happened. You deserve so much better than what he gave you.\n\nFeel free to DM me if you need someone to remind you that your decision was brave and necessary. You're going to be okay, you're doing the right thing. 💙",

That spiral of wanting someone so badly while knowing they've clearly said no... it's one of the most torturous emotional spaces to be in.\n\nFirst, you're not pathetic. You're grieving. When we lose someone we love deeply, especially when we feel like we screwed it up, our brain goes into this panic mode where it thinks if we just try harder, say the right thing, or prove our love enough, we can fix it. But here's what I've learned working with people in similar situations as a relationship coach - that desperate energy actually pushes people further away, even when it comes from a place of genuine love.\n\nThe hardest truth? She's already given you her answer. And continuing to reach out isn't showing love anymore, it's showing that you can't respect her boundary. I know that stings to hear, but sometimes we need that reality check.\n\nRight now your nervous system is completely hijacked by loss and panic. Before you can even think about letting go, you need to get some basic stability back. Delete her number if you haven't already. Block her on social media. Not forever necessarily, but right now while you're this raw you need to take measures to show up with real love whch includes honoring her boudnaries, and not prioritizing what you want over what she wants. \n\nAs a coach relationship coach I can tell you The possibility of reconnecting down the line  could theoretically be considered, but for that possibility to even exist we need to unveil a different version of yourself, not just because of her, but more so to make sure you are in control of your emotions and mind and not the other way around. \n\nThe grief you're feeling about the future you planned together is real loss that needs to be mourned, not fixed. Let yourself feel it without trying to solve it or acting on it, or expecting her to come and resolve those emotions. There's personal growth gold here if you know how to mine it. \n\nWhat were those \"stupidest mistakes\" you mentioned? Because sometimes in our guilt and desperation, we take on way more responsibility for a relationship ending than we should. \n\nThis is going to sound impossible right now, but the person you need to fall in love with is yourself. The version of you that learns from this, grows from this, and eventually becomes someone who doesn't need to beg anyone to stay.\n\nFeel free to dm me if you need someone to talk through any of this without judgment. You're going to get through this, even though it doesn't feel like it right now.",

Someone who is constantly on their phone when you are around them, but never responds or answers when you contact them when you aren't together, typically means they aren't that into you/don't like you. \n\nIf you are 100% sure she isn't meaning to be rude, or don't believe it's supposed to be a red flag, then the best thing you can do is communicate. Remain calm and ask her point blank why she seems to have trouble answering your calls but will answer other people's calls while you're in the middle of sex. \n\nBut if you think it's weird and a red flag, I say trust your gut and follow your gut feelings.",

You need to tell him about the intimacy thing where you don’t enjoy it as much the way he does it. Say that you enjoy it when he’s more intimate and you really like it when the sex is personal. You shouldn’t appease him btw. I think that’s going to hurt both of you. If you appease him you won’t be happy and you will resent him for the way you feel. It’s better to just be up front about everything. It’s also important to tell him that you love him and that you want to work things out. It seems that you love him and if he’s been with you for 3 years he’s serious about you. Being open and honest about this with him the way you typed it in this post will only strengthen your guys relationship. Last 2 things don’t let pressure from outside your relationship let you make you make decisions about inside your relationship. You need to make decisions about you for yourself. I know family is important in Asian culture, but this is your life don’t force something that isn’t there for them. This doesn’t mean that your relationship isn’t your decision btw it seems that you love this guy and you’ve been together for 3 years that’s serious time. Just don’t rush marriage especially when you guys are trying to hash things out. Also know that it’s ok to be upset with each other the real problem is at the end of the day how do you guys work it out and the only way to do that is to talk it out. Be as open as possible. Also Ik you have tried talking to him but it needs to be I need to talk to you and we need to talk for as long as possible sit down talk like talk for an hour+. Of course these are just my thoughts and I’m saying water is wet shit, but also know that you guys love each other and relationships fail not because of a lack of love, but a lack of watering the relationship and a lack of communication.",

If he expects you to accompany him on his outings , it is reasonable he pays. Either that, or he goes alone, or with a friend. You are not there to be his emotional support pet. You need to prioritize your work, it is keeping a roof over your head. Tell him you cannot spend as much money as he as you do not have rich parents subsidizing your lifestyle. Tell him you do not resent that at all, but that he should understand your situation is not the same. You have to work, and I guess you like working, too. His inability to work should not be something to be used against you.\nYou need to think if this is a man you can have a future with. He can survive on his own, so focuse on your own emotional and practical needs.",

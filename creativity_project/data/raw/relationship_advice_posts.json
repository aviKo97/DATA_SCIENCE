      "content": "I have been wanting to update but have been scared… I’ve felt so overwhelmed and haven’t been sure what to write. That post I wrote, was me at my lowest. I wish I could take the version of me in time and just hug her. I was broken down and I needed anyone to be real with me. Those comment felt like a slap in the face and way too much to handle all at once. So I needed time to read through and digest it all. \n\nThank you everyone. I was diagnosed with postpartum depression and anxiety shortly after I made my post. To the people who pushed me to talk to my doctor, thank you. My life has improved ten fold after getting proper treatment. \n\nI feel like in normal updates people dive into their lives and the details of what’s happened. I don’t want to do that. I want to say something that’s more important than me and my life. \n\nTo the new moms and their loved ones: \n\nIf you or anyone you know has just had a baby, check in on them. If you’ve just had a baby, make sure you have someone who’s tuned in to you. Although you have brought new life into the world and it should be joyous - you are allowed to feel whatever you feel. Please, even if you feel fine, prioritize your mental health and well being, because your baby depends on you to be healthy so they can be healthy. \n\nWhat you are going through is valid and important and you need someone to look out for you. While you look out for baby someone needs to look out for you with the SAME love and care. \n\nAs for me - my life has turned around. Taking care of myself was the what I needed. I know people told me to leave my husband and how horrible he is… and like every other excuse post - you don’t understand because you’re not living it. I’m happy, safe, and healthy; but most importantly my daughter is thriving. It took a lot of work and it will continue to take a lot more. I love my husband and he has shown through time that he can be reliable and hasn’t faltered. I really thought he would fail and was expecting it most days. But he hasn’t, he actually turned it around and that feels better than winning the lottery. I guess people can change when they really want to. Can’t they? I could go on and on but things are better. My daughter’s happy and healthy. She’s feisty like me and nothings gonna stop her. She loves her daddy as much as I do (sometimes more.) and now with a clear head I can see that things are okay because we have, and continue to learn how to communicate with one another. \n\nIf I could pass anything on - check on your loved ones. Sometimes they don’t even know how hard they’re struggling until you pull the wool from over their eyes. \n\nThank you to everyone. Posting was the push I needed to get help. \n",

      "content": "Spouse and I have been married 15 years and we have three kids under 10. We've both always been into fitness, but my husband is always looking for ways to do more. Last year he trained for, and completed, his first triathlon.\n\nWe were all pretty proud of him and glad he had the experience, but the training really kind of sucked for us at home. He spent over three months working out nearly every day; it was incredibly time consuming. He'd spend hours a day. For example, some days he'd work his job and then come home and do a 3 hour bike ride or run. There were many days when he flat out didn't see our kids at all and I really felt like a single mom.\n\nAbout a month after his triathlon he starting talking about how he wanted to do another right away. I immediately asked him what his plans were for triathlons and he said that he'd like to do them continuously throughout the year. I told him that if that was the case, that I really didn't think I could do that and that it might be best if we part ways.\n\nHe was incredibly upset and indignant- told me I was unsupportive and trying to sabotage him. He said it was unfair to make that demand- that if I was dating someone I would never ask them to quit their hobby. And he's right- I wouldn't but I would still absolutely peace out because their hobby is incompatible with the life I'm looking for. \n\nI didn't really feel like I was even making a *demand*... I was just stating a fact that it was really hard to support the family alone while he trained and that I couldn't see myself doing it *forever* if he wanted to become a triathlete. Even though it was \"unsupportive\" on paper, I feel like the most supportive thing I can do in this situation is to step away and let him do what he wants and chase his dreams.\n\nHe eventually agreed to drop the triathlons because we're the \"most important thing\" to him... but it's been *months* and he still finds ways to make snide comments about it or will bring it up out of the blue if we argue. I can't tell if he's just feeling resentful or if he's trying to get me to feel bad and change my mind about it. \n\nAt any rate, I still feel the same way and there's no chance I'm going to change my mind. How do we move forward from this?",

      "title": "33f wife is devolving into  a human I 38m don’t feel safe around.",
      "content": "Posting for a friend who doesn’t have Reddit but wants some advice. Here is his story. \n\nI 38m and my wife 33f have been together 10 years married for 7. Until the last 1.5 years everything has been great. We have 2 wonderful kids together, we are financially stable, we own our house, live in a good neighborhood, etc etc. (Our boys are 3 & 6, this will factor in later)\n\nNow my wife is insanely intelligent. She’s beautiful and until recently, she’s been a great mother. Selfless. She makes sure everything runs smoothly. And if you were to meet our children, they’re these happy little larks. They speak 3 languages (she spoke 2 natively and learned 2 more one to b2 and one to C1 just so she could insure they could learn more), they excel. \n\nAnd mostly our relationship was peaceful. We had our ups and downs, went though a break up 6 years ago.\n\nNow my wife has always been a bit anxious, but never been a yeller, rarely angry. She was an irritable person at times, but minority irritable (she sighed a lot, or rolled her eyes) like signs you know she’s irritated but well within normal. \n\nSo when ppl say there are always signs… idk, she mentally snapped. Now she has been in therapy and has a psychiatrist (she is adhd, high anxiety, imposter syndrome) and has been on Xanax, Xoloft, those on and off for awhile (which is why this behavior is more alarming)\n\nFor the last 18 months, she’s been more withdrawn… new baby, I’m sympathetic it’s hard being a mom and a primary care giver… she’s chronically on the phone, in the news, on social media (she has a work from home job and she’s specialized so she can make her own hours and work when she pleases)… she started tuning out. \n\nWe agreed, talk to psychiatrist, they said maybe post partum but that overall she seems happy, it may just been escapism and strain from kids… lack of sleep… \n\nThat went on for about a year…\n\nThese last 6 months have been hell. And I’m becoming terrified of my wife. She had suddenly personality swings (I mean sudden) about once a month… she goes from being slightly anxious but loving, doting mother, wife to I want to watch the world burn… it last 1-3 days but it’s becoming more aggressive. \n\nOur oldest didn’t eat his lunch, she throws the lunch box in the garbage and tells him that he can just get diabetes and cancer like the rest of the Americans and die a slow death from junk food for all she cares. \n\nThe 3 year old started crying and she covered her ears and just starts chanting shut up shut up until she starts yelling and they’re both quiet. \n\nShe’ll make condescending comments about her self “yeah don’t listen to me, I’m just a useless fat servant here for you guys, it’s cool, I’m not important anyway… it would be better if I died so your dad can remarry somebody younger”… my wife isn’t fat and looks about 24… she’s a size 2 after 2 kids… \n\nI’ve told her that if this behavior doesn’t change that this relationship won’t last.\n\nNow I may have said that at the wrong time (she was ranting) in the garage… because her voice gets real quiet and she walks out to the car (parked on the street)… at the time I didn’t understand why she did this… thought she was calming down… I approach her and she says in a very low but almost demonic voice… see how that turns out for you. \n\n I let her cool down, life continues as normal, she apologies, talks to her therapist, they change her meds… she seems calm again until a month later when that internal demon comes again…\n\nI again say things at the wrong time… this time I said I will leave with the kids if this behavior continues, I’m here to help, but this needs to stop. \n\nShe says essential… I will make your life hell, sure prenup favors you, and you will try and take as much financially. Fine… I’m smarter, I’m more attractive, and on paper I’m perfect to law enforcement and the cops. You take my kids away, some of us aren’t going to live to see the end of that filing. And idk which would hurt you more… but guaranteed…. I will make it hurt more than money ever could… so make your next decision wisely. \n\n\nThis terrifies me. She’s not wrong on paper she’s perfect minus anxiety; PTA mom, great job, kids who adore her. Oh the reason she walked to the car I found out was out of reach of security cameras. I did file a police report and sent the footage. She explained the argument away.  have the report but even to my friends and family with her very convincing explanation and use of her walking in and out of ear shot of the camera, (intelligent) it’s manipulation on another level. The threat isn’t empty. \n\nI’ve considered using that she’s in therapy but I’ve been in too and really the only thing on record is anxiety. Never violence. Even talking to her psychiatrist with what little I could get was, he couldn’t testify to violence, nothing in her personality or sessions suggests violence.\n\nI love her, and don’t truely feel this is her. This extreme change more than her words makes me worried and maybe I shouldn’t have said the D word out of anger but I was hoping that would bring her to reality?\n\n**edit since many in my comments said i need to include this and I keep repeating this**\n\n1) I have hired 3 different sitters to take the load off, she didn't like any of them.  Also tried a meal service to ease cooking and she didn't want it due to plastics and said shes at home, she can take care of the kids and cook.  She'll hire a sitter when she feels it's needed.  I feel it's needed, but I can't force that on her.\n\n2) She doesn't sleep.  Maybe 4-5 hours a night\n\n3)Her psychatrist has her on Xanax, Zoloft and Wellbutrin at the same time\n\n4)She recently weened for the first time for any length of time in the past 6 years.  She nursed number one until he was practically 3 then pretty much had number 2 and started nursing him with maybe a few week break while switching meds and she pumped. \n\n5) I'm a civil/field engineer, i have projects at times that keep me from home sometimes hours a day to days/weeks a month, so I can take responsibility for not being home a lot, it's why I try to hire out services.\n\n6) She works from home about 25 hours a week, I did offer her to be a stay at home mom if she wanted or work full time.. this was her choice of hours.\n\nAnybody else deal with this? Any advice would be appreciated\n",

      "content": "Had to make a new account as I’m not convinced family hasn’t discovered my main. My husband apparently stands while he wipes which leads to what I am now calling “butt crumbles” (not literal shit it’s dirty toilet paper pieces.. not that it makes it much better) on anything and everything on the bathroom floor.. it’s not like a lot but still it’s so gross. I wish I never realized where that mysterious “dirt” was coming from.. He insists that it’s normal to wipe standing, that he can’t wipe sitting down, he’s big but not that big, and that it’s not a big deal he just forgets to check/clean up sometimes but I don’t know I don’t even like the idea of him wiping over our floors or any clothes on them (I’m the one that usually picks up the dirty laundry) even if nothing was visibly left behind. I feel like it’s fair to have him ~~atleast sweep~~ clean the floors and deal with any clothes on the floor everyday if he continues this or just until he’s out of the habit of wiping standing up but he thinks I’m bring ridiculous. (That it’s not a big deal he just forgot to clean it up) \n\nEdit: A lot of people are making the assumption that my husband expects me to clean up after him or that I have been but trust me I wouldn’t touch that with a ten foot pole. I only gather dirty laundry He’s been cleaning it up.. but me pointing it out and making him clean it when he “forgets” or “misses something” apparently hasn’t been enough to convince him to stop wiping standing up so now I want him to clean the floors properly everyday regardless of whether he was “clean” until he does start sitting while he wipes which is what he finds ridiculous",

He complained about no time and there's no money. So I help get it, dusk till dawn so that we can do this.

He said \"some expenses came up, that he had to eat and live as well, we'll make the money back.\" On top of \"if I expect him to feel bad about it\" \n\nDo I expect you to feel bad about spending our trip fund? That I also worked hard on earning? I told him he should've starved before touching that. Bread, butter, and sugar before a finger touched that money. \n\nI'm considering ditching him. Ghost. \n\nI was looking forward to that trip, I've working hard back to back for so long, I was ready for some peace and solitude at the beach. I needed it, bad. And the money was there for it and it was gone in a day. I can feel myself breaking down a bit, I really don't want to be a vile person to him. \n\nIs this something that I should even try to move forward from? Its hard for me to honestly look at him right now. I'm tired of things being stripped from me my whole life, he was the last person that I needed doing that right now. \n\nCommunication and setting boundaries doesn't feel like it'll fix this. ",

We all just talked for a while and then they both left . \n\nWe didn't talk about it but my gf was being extra sweet to me and a Lil nervous . I could guess what was she thinking . Look I know her I'm sure she ain't cheating on me but tbh I don't wanna be in this kind of relation where she is that close to other men . \n\nSo I don't know cause ik she'll start crying and explaining herself if I say I wanna breakup and maybe I'm being insecure too idk  I would love a different pov tho\n\nEdit : I'm seeing a few misunderstandings in comments , when I arrived in the room the one opened the door was jessica my gf's friend and after a while jack and jessica left leaving me and gf .\n\nAbout how I'm sure she isn't cheating, I just can't explain it she is just this overly comfortable with this jack and that's the reason to breakup , not cause I suspect her of cheating I just hate this relation dynamic these two have .

Last time she was drunk she was with a teacher '30M' in his apartment at 6am and they were talking deep. Nothing else happened by her words. She just wants to help and understand people.\n\nShe grew up without a dad and I think she wants safety and stuff like that from older men. We have had a lot of fights because of this. She says I am delusional and I am just overly jealous and I understand that, I might be the problem.\n\nBut for me I just find it weird, that she usually finds herself with older men and likes them, compliments them and wants them around. I think it's something that doesn't belong to a relationship. She just says she wants to help and nurture them. \n\nAnyway can someone help me and bring some line of thinking to this. I think she is doing something wrong and she is thinking that this is okay. What do you think? Am I the problem?",

We checked in a nearby hotel and went for my surgery in the morning. After they took me to the operating room, my boyfriend claims he was told by the nurses that it might last awhile and he can leave if he wants as they will notify him when I wake up. We never agreed on this, I thought he will be there waiting for me. Anyway the surgery went on quick and I woke up right away in pain to an empty room. I asked the nurse to bring my phone and call him, but he was unreachable. He returned to the hotel, went back to sleep and left his phone on silent. Finally the nurse contacted the hotel and the receptionist went on knocking on his door to wake him up. I cannot describe how hurt and abandoned I felt. He considers he did nothing wrong, yet I cannot get over it.\nWas this lack of communication of expectations or should have been something natural to be on the side of the person you love, when they need it the most?

Sometimes I feel like I hate her and sometimes not… I am going crazy. \n\nNow she really regrets it, and wants to do anything she can to rebuild the trust and marry with me. \n\nAnyone had a similar experience? And wyd?\n\nThanks",

I want to move forward and open my heart again, but I keep pushing people away before they get close because I’m scared of being hurt again. What are some healthy ways to rebuild trust in new relationships after being hurt? How can I balance protecting myself while still being open to connection? I’d really appreciate any advice or strategies that helped you heal and trust again.",

      "content": "Back when my husband and I started dating, I mentioned that one of my relationship boundaries is I don’t and won’t be in a relationship with military members. My dad was in the AF and was gone during early childhood. This is something I don’t want for my family. \n\nNow, only after we got married, my husband has decided that he wants to join the Air Force. We’ve been married since July, he graduated school in December, and since having trouble finding a job in his field, he’s decided the military is his best bet. I reminded him that this isn’t something I’m okay with in relationships. I told him I won’t raise kids away from my family, and I don’t want to travel myself when I could be starting my career. I’m currently in nursing school and would need to quit my program and start over. (Edit: he currently has a job that pays more than what the military will. It’s just not in the field he studied for)\n\nHe has continued to insist. At first he said he would do the guard, which I reluctantly agreed to because he could be stationed near us. Now he is insisting on active duty. We also recently learned we will need to do ivf to have a family. This is something we are supposed to start next month, and now I’m facing the possibility of doing it alone. I’m not sure how to handle this. Any words of encouragement?",

      "content": "My partner and I have had issues with trust over the past couple years and share two children. I had found out that at his last job he had a girl who was 18 slap his ass and then later proposition him to go into an empty room. I only found out because he was bragging to his parents about it (gross). He later explained to me she had slapped his butt and he had told her not to do that. When I asked why she would then proposition him later if he had made it clear already and shut her down he said he didn't know. \n\nI honestly felt he was probably engaging in it but had no real proof he hadn't tried to be appropriate. I did ask why he wouldn't go to hr and he acted like it wasn't that big of a deal and she left after a couple weeks. He said he forgot her name because it was a while ago, I did not believe it but again tried to move on. \n\nHe worked a new job after that for about six months and at one point I saw he exchanged Spotify top 100 with a random female coworker. He claimed she was doing it with everybody, I told him I'd prefer he didn't text co-workers after what happened at his last job. Within a week I found a deleted text he sent her of a new tattoo he got. He claimed this was because it was wrapped and co-workers wanted to see it, he had not thought about it and once he realized I'd be upset deleted it. \n\nI recently had a ex co-worker of his from that last job tell me now that he was flirting heavily with this girl and being inappropriate. The ex co-worker was her ex as well and was amused I said I had been suspicious of her as my instincts were correct.My partner claims the guy is lying and just trying to get with me, he has asked to hang out so that could be. But I highly doubt it. \n\nI asked him if I could message her as him to see how she responds to him and try to gauge if they were too friendly. He went nuts and said it's abusive and no matter what I'll read into it. He said he would not do that and would rather end the relationship. I feel that even further means he is guilty since it seems fairly simple. I honestly feel it is a valid request and he is avoiding the possibility of her saying something that would sell him out. How would you proceed in this situation?",

      "content": "My (28m) wife (27f) and I have been together for 5 years married for 6 months and she is working a contract at a theme park as a performer. I am so proud that she got this contract and gets to do exactly what she wants to do and make decent money. But the tough part is the distance. I am still working at my job at home because the job market is awful and this seems like the best solution at this time. I went to visit this past weekend to watch her and see her. The visit was going great until the evening before I left when she brings up something that she had been feeling guilty about. I was like okay shoot and she said that she’s been having issues with feeling lonely and desired because we had both been so busy and unable to talk on the phone as much. She told me that one of her castmates and her were joking around with each other and she said she felt strange and didn’t know what to make of it at first but then told me that she realized that she found it hot and later dreamed about said cast mate. She said she freaked out and has been feeling so guilty about it and we ended up having a heart to heart about our feelings about the situation and about each other which led to insanely hot passionate sex. I also came to the realization during our conversation that I had grown too complacent and passive in our relationship and needed to work on my game and flirting with her. I thought all was well until the next day when I went home and had too much time to think. I started feeling really anxious and upset. I started to feel upset by the fact that she was attracted to another guy and how he had made her feel something that I’ve been feeling like I struggle to make her feel lately. I just keep comparing myself to him. It’s so stupid in a way though because I would be lying if I said I hadn’t been attracted to another women at all during our relationship and after all she didn’t do anything or act on any of those thoughts. Not to mention she’s very attracted to me just based on the sex we had, the amount of enthusiasm and love, and the conversation we had was very healthy and productive. She has since told me she’s feeling better about our relationship and that she’s not feeling attraction towards said person at this point. It’s very possible that all of this was just a result of misguided feelings of missing me or just natural biology. I think under different circumstances this wouldn’t be that big of a deal but because we’re operating on a LDR while she works this contract makes this difficult. I feel like this has led to me being anxiously attached atm which is very uncharted territory for me as I usually lean avoidant. I’ve just been miserable this week and go through phases during the day just ruminating about my feelings. I feel like this triggered a trauma response from old unhealed wounds from my past about being abandoned or betrayed and am struggling to cope. I had a conversation with her about my feelings this week and she  was supportive and understanding and she validated all of my feelings. She’s been super open and understanding of my reaction, but it’s just hard, idk how to move forward at the moment and go back to a feeling of normalcy and comfort in the relationship. \n\nMy true question is, how do I move on from this in a healthy way?\n\nTl;dr: My wife was feeling lonely and her love tank was low while doing LDR and felt attraction and had a dream about castmate. We had a great heart to heart but I’m struggling to move on from the situation.",

      "content": "TL;DR: My wife has severe postpartum depression. She’s barely eating, cries most of the day and feels disconnected from our baby. Her doctor recommended psychiatric inpatient care, but she’s terrified and thinks she’s being locked up.I’m completely overwhelmed trying to care for our newborn, her, and everything else. I want to support her but I don’t know what to expect from the psych stay  and I don’t know what to tell her it will be like.\n\nMy wife gave birth to our son three months  ago, and she’s been struggling badly with postpartum depression. She was diagnosed right after birth, but honestly this started from the moment she got pregnant.\nEven though the pregnancy was planned, her mental health started going downhill fast. She kept saying she didn’t feel right but doctor said things would get better once the baby was born. That didn’t happen. It’s only gotten worse.\nDuring the pregnancy she barely ate. I had to constantly check in and remind her to eat something. She gained around 15 pounds total, and I was genuinely scared we might lose our baby.\nAfter the birth she didn’t even want to hold him. The doctors said that  it will get better, prescribed her meds and sent her home. There was no follow up or deeper evaluation. \nSince then most days she’s just been in bed crying, not eating, barely talking. I figured maybe the meds just needed time but it’s been a month and nothing’s really changed.\n\nI’m working 12 hours a day, taking care of our newborn and her. I had to ask my mom to stay with us because I can’t leave the baby alone with her right now. \nShe barely eats and has lost even more weight since giving birth. My mom tries to cook for her, sit with her, encourage her but she still refuses most food. She fainted twice. \nA couple weeks ago she went out with some friends. I was actually relieved. Thought it might be a good sign, that maybe meds are working and she’s doing better.\nBut she came home high. I don’t know what she took. I sat her down and asked. She said she doesn’t feel like a mom. Said she loves our baby but can’t feel it. After that, she just shut down again.\n\nI told her she needs to see a professional. The psychiatrist recommended inpatient treatment. She totally crashed. She sat on the floor crying, saying she’s scared, ashamed, and doesn’t want to be  locked up.\nI told her I’d find a quiet, private place, and we’d visit her all the time. After a few hours of talking, she finally agreed to go. \n\nShe’s still terrified. What should we expect, and how can I support her through this\n",

      "content": "Growing up, I often saw my parents argue without knowing why. Eventually, I found out my dad was having an affair when I saw a message sent to my mom saying the other woman was pregnant. People close to the mistress would taunt my mom, and she endured a lot (wild I know, these monsters of humans have no decency at all). My siblings and I also went through things no child ever should because of that affair.\n\nIn 2012, my parents considered separating but chose to stay together to keep the \"family intact\". My mom stayed, and I’ve never questioned her decision. She is the strongest and most amazing woman I know. If she had left, I would have supported her fully and gone with her. I live in Asia, where cultural norms can be deeply patriarchal, especially back then, so I hope others can understand the complexity behind her choice.\n\nThey’ve mostly mended things since then, and as far as I’m aware, the affair has ended. A few years ago, though, my dad’s former mistress kept berating my mom with nasty messages out of jealousy (for reasons I won’t disclose, and I also don’t need to justify her horrible behavior). This pushed my mom to her limit, and as triggered as I was, I wanted to know who this trash of a human was. I found her on Facebook and discovered she has two kids, both of whom resemble my dad. That’s when I found out I have half-siblings. I felt betrayed, angry, and deeply unloved. I wondered why me, my siblings, and my mom weren’t enough for my dad. Why did he have to make another family with someone else?\n\nI kept my feelings to myself until I confronted him a few years later. I told him everything I knew, how much it hurt, and how much I hated him. He apologized and made real efforts to make it up to me, my mom, and my siblings. He had been trying before, but this time he communicated it more clearly.\n\nFast forward to now, and I can say our relationship has been mostly good. Sometimes, though, I still get this aching feeling whenever I’m reminded that I have half-siblings. They haven’t done anything to me, but if I’m being honest, I wish they were never born. They and the mistress are living proof of my mom’s pain. Because of everything I went through growing up, I don’t think I am capable of forming healthy romantic relationships with men.\n\nHow do I accept this and move on?",

      "content": "I feel like I’m living in a fever dream. \n\nMy dad and I don’t live in the same state so we call each other like once a week. \n\nWell, he called me today and everything was normal at first. We chatted about work and his kids (my dad has remarried and has 3 other children) and stuff and then out of nowhere he says “can I tell you a secret?” \n\nI was a bit confused because he’s never phrased anything like that to me before. But I said “sure, if you want to.” And then he said repeatedly “this stays between me and you” and “you can’t repeat this to anyone” \n\nI just agreed and started getting a bit worried. I thought he was gonna tell me he had an affair or something. I almost wish he had. But he flat out said, “I like (friend’s name).” \n\nI just went quiet. I didn’t know what to say. What was I even supposed to say to that? After a couple of seconds, I said, “you’re married.” \n\nHe said, “I know. And I love my wife very much, but when she was with us I felt weird.” \n\nContext: I make occasional visits to my home state, the last one being about a month ago. That entire weekend I spent with said friend. I took her to my brother’s house, my dad’s, my mom’s. Basically she came with me everywhere I went. This is nothing new. When I was younger, I would spend summer breaks at my dad’s, and my friend would spent weekends with us. \n\nHe’s known her since she was about 12. She is no stranger to my dad. The worst part? She lost her dad around the same age she met my dad, so my dad became a sort of father-figure in her life. This is something she’s said to him many times. He knows this. \n\nI’m just truly speechless. I just said, “you’re married.” “She sees you as a father-figure, you know that.” \n\nI mean, the days we spent at my dad’s, we all just hung out. We chatted, ate, we had conversations with his wife. We even went back the next day and all went to the flea market together. I even showed my dad and his wife videos of my friend playing with my dad’s kids when they were in diapers. Like I said, she’s known my dad for about a decade. And as far as I know, he’s never displayed any creepy behavior towards her. \n\nI can’t remember exactly what was said since I was so shocked but my dad said things like “she’s a grown woman, 22, like you” “I wouldn’t even be able to communicate with her anyways” (he only speaks Spanish, friend only speaks English)\n\nEventually, once he realized I had pretty much stopped talking, he said to forget the conversation ever happened. He changed the subject, we chatted for another minute or so and right before hanging up, he said again to forget everything he said. \n\nI’m just lost. Truly. How would he feel if someone his age were speaking that way about me? My dad isn’t a person of many words, so the fact that he shared that with me? I feel like maybe it’d been eating at him and he just needed to tell someone. \n\nHe clearly knew I was weirded out since he kept telling me to forget it. And I’m just stuck. Do I tell my friend? I don’t want to ruin the image she’s built up of my dad. Plus, I know shes mentioned that being constantly objectified is something that really upsets her. And I’ll just be like “hey! Btw, the one man you thought was safe actually objectified you too!!!” She doesn’t spend any time with my dad when I’m not there. She doesn’t have his number or anything. I just feel like ignorance is bliss here. \n\nI spoke to my brother (different biological dad but he did grow up with my dad) about it and he was weirded out too. Initially, I was planning on never speaking about it again but I think I should. I just don’t know what to say. \n\nWhat do I even say? How do I approach this? I get having crushes on people, even when married, but those are things you keep to yourself!!!! I’m just so weirded out right now.\n\n",

      "content": "So me and this guy matched on Bumble over the summer. For context we’re both in college (I’m a rising senior and he’s a rising junior). Everything was going pretty well, except that he lives in Florida and I’m in Rhode Island so we can’t actually meet up until the school year starts again in August. But we started texting and Facetiming pretty frequently until it was every day. \n\nHe’s overall a really sweet guy (or at least, he has been to me), but sometimes goes a little overboard. We’ve only been talking for three weeks but he uses pet names on me and compliments me VERY often. It honestly felt very cringy to me and almost icked me out but I tried to ignore it because I felt like our connection was pretty strong and we got along well.\n\nFast forward to a few days ago, when I finally told one of my friends about him. I was asking her advice since he was offering to visit me in Rhode Island, which I thought was a bad idea since it would technically be our first “real” date, and if we didn’t get along we’d be stuck together since he has to fly over. During that conversation I sent her his Instagram and she immediately gasped and started telling me some of the things she’s heard about him.\n\nI’d never met him in person on our campus since he’s a year below me, but apparently she knew about some sexual assault allegations against him, and it’s pretty well known (for context our college is about 2,000 undergrad with only three dorm buildings so it’s super small and almost everyone knows everyone in some way). I didn’t get specifics because I didn’t want to make it seem like I didn’t believe her/was trying to argue with her, but at one point she mentioned that he has multiple Title9 cases against him and that one of her friends walked in on him having sex with another girl (I don’t think that was the sexual assault case she was referring to but she used it to basically prove that he’s a player as well. I showed her a compliment he had sent me and she said “he’s probably said that to four different girls in the last hour”). \n\nSo I decided to confront him about it, basically saying I heard about the allegations and I didn’t think I wanted to continue the relationship. I was really disappointed about it but I knew that it had to be done. \n\nHe was very respectful of my decision but said that he wanted to explain himself. He then sent me definite proof that he didn’t have a title9 case against him. (Though I know that doesn’t mean the assault didn’t happen, just that a report wasn’t filed).\n\nI basically told him I needed space and time to think, which he was respectful of. I feel awful for wanting to believe him and continue speaking to him, and I could never forgive myself if the allegations turned out to be true. \n\nI also think there’s a possibility I’m being love bombed by all the compliments and nice words, and that I’m falling for it because I don’t have as much experience in relationships.\n\nOr he could be a genuine guy and I could be missing out on something great if I just block him and move on like my friend suggested.\n\nUPDATE: i texted him saying that i needed to ask questions about it, and if he chose not to answer that was fine but it means that we can’t keep talking. i do feel awful about not just blocking him and running away but i think i need closure. i am worried i’m subconsciously looking for him to have a good excuse to move forward ",

He lent me his phone to create a laundry list, we have build a lot of trust and actually that’s why he has no problem lending me his phone. I don’t usually use it. My impulsive thoughts got over me and I went through his whatsapp. I know this means I broke the trust we have build together. And I’m totally aware I made a mistake here. I went through a conversation with an ex-coworker and found text messages that personally I consider cheating. They both were kind of flirty. Don’t want to give a lot of context on this. \n\nThe thing is that lying is driving me crazy. I really want to come through and accept my mistake and I also want to ask him about this person and to hear his side of the story. But I am also scared of a break up. \nNot sure what to do. I really want to be honest but I am scared of losing him. But I also want him to give some explanations which I feel I deserve. What would you do on this situation? ",

      "content": "My husband and I have been together over 10 years, married for six. We e are in the process of buying our first home. (At least I hope.) we’ve already gone through the preapproval process, have a realtor and have looked at several homes. **This is going to start out sounding like a real estate question but really it’s not, it’s a relationship question, just need to give some backstory**\n\nWe were close to buying a house in 2022, which thank goodness we didn’t because we all know what was happening in the housing market then. Now that the market has cooled down and it’s become more of a buyers market again (at least in the area we live, MCOL area in WA state) we are ready. We have more than enough saved and our finances are great with almost no debt. Also no kids. \n\nWe have found a couple houses which are in my opinion, really good options. I’m from the city we live in, he is not. So I know which areas are good for appreciation and are generally safe and nice to live in. He is a big “data” guy and he overthinks EVERYTHING. At first I was grateful but now it’s just getting on my nerves. \nI feel like he has to overthink every detail and doesn’t take my word for which areas are good. Like he needs some “data” to back it up. It’s frustrating. \n\nIt’s starting to feel like he is unwilling to compromise on anything. One house in particular we both really liked, in a great area, huge backyard, underpriced because it needs a bit of work, with MUCH more expensive homes around it. We went home to think about it and he concludes that “The house isn’t facing the right way for sun, I need sun in the afternoon.” ??? He was looking at this website which shows where the sun would land on the house at different parts of the day. We toured this home and it literally wasn’t dark at all, so I really don’t know what he’s talking about. I was really wanting to put an offer on this house but he said no, “we need to keep waiting because there’s about to be a flood of houses and sellers are getting desperate.”\n\nI just feel like he’s speculating and it’s doing nothing but holding us back. We’ve been renting for so long, neither of us can take it anymore, and we’re also getting older and I feel he’s also holding us back from having kids because he doesn’t want to until we buy a house. I’m starting to feel resentful and depressed, and like we aren’t moving forward in life at all. I don’t even really have the desire to look at houses anymore because every one I send to him which is a good option, he finds some little thing wrong or says “let’s just wait a few days.” \n\nI see other people I know having kids, buying their second and third homes, and we’re stuck in the same spot because he won’t just commit to something. I know not to compare myself to other people but it’s really hard, especially when I know we have the finances to make it happen. Friends and family around us who own homes keep telling him there’s no need to wait, if you find the right house just go for it, but he seems to think he’s the only one who’s right. Every time I try to bring up my concerns, he just says “I feel like you just want to buy any house for the sake of having a house.” But this isn’t true at all, I’m also being picky but he’s on another level! \n\nSo what can I say to him or how can I start this conversation to make him really understand? Every time I try I feel I get nowhere. ",

We are very compatible in so many ways, especially in the ways that are non negotiable for me. I've known from very early in talking with him , that he had never had a girlfriend and had never had sex. \n\nI am very sexually experienced, more than most, and sex used to be something I offered very early in meeting people. As the years have gone by I've changed how I felt about this for me and began shifting my values towards wanting to have a strong emotional connection before complicating things with sex. So I was not bothered by his lack of experience, Infact I felt like it might be fun to help him discover what he likes sexually. I am very confident in asking for what I want, giving positive feedback, and discussing what he wants to try, I'm also receptive to feedback.\n\n I've asked him what he likes and he's been vague. I also don't want to push him and make him feel pressured or uncomfortable in anyway. The issue lies in that, to say sex is underwhelming is an understatement. I think it comes down to his own confidence and the last thing I want to do is to give feedback in a way that effects that.  \n\nHow can I approach this without hurting his feelings? Is there books I can suggest to him to read that might help his confidence? \n\nAlso trying to figure out my own needs here and what I'm willing to sacrifice for someone who I have an otherwise promising connection with. \n\nAny and all advice is appreciated.

It's been 7 years and he's still in school and I'm struggling at home with the kids. Our kids are not in school full time (2 under 5). I worked through both pregnancies to get maternity leave and have worked a few part time jobs since then. I desperately don't want to be at home anymore as it's really affecting my mental health. One of our kids is autistic and really struggles being away from me so I can't work full time. \n\nMy husband is still in school 7 years later and has many more years to go to reach where he wants to be. He leaves at 7am and comes home usually around 6pm. \n\nI understand that he has long days and it can be stressful to have a long day at work and have to come home and be a parent. In my opinion, we have both have jobs; him: school, me: kids. However, I feel like home life should be 50/50. Cleaning, cooking, groceries, family planning of any kind, doing things with the kids. I do all of this and it's a lot. Even on weekends. Our kids go to school for 2.5hrs 4 days a week and during that time I usually get groceries or clean/cook. \n\nI resent him for how little he does at home. I've explained I want him to do more at home or with the kids and he might for a day or two but that's it.  I honestly see his days as a nice break, he gets to go to the gym, have adult conversations and work alone. He also doesn't have a great relationship with our kids. They never want to be with him and cry when I leave. \n\nHe thinks I'm asking too much and I feel like I'm not.\n\nEDIT: He's been in school since he was 18 and never stopped. He went to firefighting school, paramedicine, undergrad in bio Chem, and now he's in his master's. He ultimately wants to go to med school. He works in the summers as a medic and does school the rest of the year. We do fine financially. He brings in a lot during the summers and we have student loans and savings. My mom also helps us with rent. ",

      "content": "\nI'm in my 30s and I see all my friends having babies, starting little families and I'm honestly so envious of them. I have always been on the fence about having children but as I get a bit older my desire to have a child is increasing. \n\nThe only thing stopping me, is that I dont think my partner is who I want to have children with. I love my partner, we have a nice life. We have a house, good jobs, a dog. We have our ups and downs like most couples. The Household chores fall predominantly on my shoulders and since getting the dog, the additional workload has also fallen on my shoulders. I feel as though if we have a child, that would also fall on me. I constantly have the same argument that my partner isn't pulling their weight, we both work the same hours, my partner struggles to wake up in time for work when they start at 8am and work from home, most mornings they're still in bed until 8.30. I am constantly picking up rubbish, taking down dirty dishes and glasses that pile up over thr work week in their office and on their bed side table, I wash our clothes, clean the kitchen surfaces, hoover, fill the dishwasher and empty it, pick up the trail of clothes, shoes and rubbish my partner has left around the house, refill the toilet roll instead of placing it on top of an empty tube and loads more. My partner will pick up bits, temporarily. And then it will drop again and go back to normal until I'm exhausted and sick of it again. A lot of the time my partner will just sit on the sofa and barely move all evening. \n\nIn addition to this my partner has health issues, they are overweight and do very little to help themselves with their health issues. I feel as though they make excuses for not being able to do XYZ due to their health. My partner claims they're always tired, always complaining about being in pain, having bowl issues, knee issues, headaches and I know they can't help this so I feel awful for complaining about it. But if we were to have a baby and I was in recovery, I feel as though my partners health would still be a priority. \n\nI suffer with mental health that isn't fantastic, I'm exhausted from having to keep on top of the chores, the dog, work and finding time for myself but I still manage to pull through and show up. I show up for our house so things dont stack up and become bigger jobs, I show up for our dog who needs feeding, walks, entertainment and attention. I work full time on top of this.\n\nI want a baby, but I don't think my partner is the right person to have a baby with. They can't even wake up on a morning to let the dog out or take him for a walk before work. I manage to all of the above and more without any issues. So why can't I have the support. How am I supposed to manage everything above and adding pregnancy, a baby and recovering into it all. How does a baby fit into this without me just tackling another job without any support from my partner. \n\nI may regret not having a baby later in life but right now it's not an option and I feel as though my partner is the reason why. Has anyone else gone through anything similar?",

He talked about our future, about how he was going to \"take care\" of me and our future kids. He was always showing love and affection.\n\nWe got married and within a month, he was becoming distant and mean. Would snap at me more and more. Didn't really care for intimacy as much. By the time of our first anniversary, I realized that he had become a different man. But I was pregnant. \n\nHonestly, you probably already know how the rest goes... he got even more mean when I became more emotional and needy as the pregnancy progressed. It's lonely when your husband refuses to kiss you or take you out while you're going through the hardest change in your life.\n\nAnd then the baby arrived and of course, he couldn't be bothered to help me at all. I cried every night and he never comforted me even once. Only time he took the baby on his own was when I had a mental breakdown and started throwing things around the house.\n\nSleeping an average of 3 hours a day for a few months can do that to you I guess. \n\nHe took the baby and just left the house without saying a word to me. I called him many times because the baby was only breastfed and he came back 4 hours later with a screaming baby. He yelled at me and left the house again. \n\nI don't know why I stayed after that. I was depressed for 2 years but when my sister came out her for a few months, she helped me get out of it.\n\nEven almost 4 years later, sometimes I feel like I still struggle, but I was able to get out of it. Now, I'm realizing how miserable our marriage and its beginning to affect our child.\n\nHe ignores me constantly, if I'm talking to him he just tunes me out. He ignores our child too, to the point that our child only goes to me or will scream at my husband to get his attention. \n\nHe never says thank you to anything I do. BUT will get upset if I don't thank him or am ungrateful about anything he does. Same thing with our kid. Our kid even began scolding my husband that he needs to say thank you to me.\n\nHe treats his family and friends with more attention and care than he does with me. He hangs on their every word, engages with them, spends more quality time with them.. if I ask for quality family time, he'll put on a show and go on his phone. \n\nI can't stand it anymore. I don't want our child seeing this anymore. If anything our child deserves better. \n\nAdvice? Thoughts? I'm more or less posting to just talk about it.\n\nHe also refuses to get any professional counseling because \"they'll just say he needs to do better\". \n\nI have no job, no idea what to do. I'm just done.",

      "title": "My (29F) partner (32M)’s friend (49M) who encouraged him to cheat in the past is now back in our lives again…",
      "content": "My partner J had a 49 year old friend called Will who’s been his friend for over 10 years. Will is a single man and hasn’t really been able to keep relationships since J knew him. When I started dating J, I accepted his friend Will and I was even hoping to meet him one day since J always talked about him. I never really thought of their friendship other than maybe brotherhood as J is really good at keeping his friends. Until one day I found out Will has been insulting me & has been heavily derogatory when he found out I was dating J. For context, I’m Asian. J & Will are white. It started off from them sending each other stuff about “how to bag an Asian baddie” to pretty much the most stereotypical insults for Asian women dating white men. I grew up in this country for more than half my life. I was brought here as a little girl so I am a citizen and I call this country home now.\n\nI didn’t really see these messages until later on but it gets worse. At this point, J & I have been dating for 8 months. We’re travelling together in Europe when I saw a message on J’s phone with Will saying “Latvian chicks are hot. Are you getting an upgrade?”. Furious was an understatement. J & I were already pretty serious at this point with plans to move in together after travelling from Europe. I have not renewed my lease & have my stuff going to the new place. Instead of J defending me, he didn’t say anything. He acted as if it was a joke. So i walked away from him & almost left him at the airport until his Mum messaged me as she got worried about me (he told his Mum about his eff-up). \n\nJ apologised and finally blocked this guy and told this guy to eff off and to stop insulting his gf. I thought that was done for good. I also found out that Will has been pushing J to cheat on his past gf’s, which he did, to date multiple women & use them, & pretty much cheered him on when he found out J was dating other women when we just became exclusive. I was extremely disappointed that this 32 year old man is easily influenced by a man almost 50 years his age.\n\nFinally, that stopped after he blocked him. 6 months later (so 14 months of dating each other and even living together), I found out he started talking to the guy again. The guy that has been encouraging him to cheat on me & ruin our relationship. I caught him while we were watching vids on his phone and a message from him popped up. I was livid. He lied to me about not speaking to him again. What angered me the most was he said “it was a long time ago, I forgot he even said that. I’m 32 & I can talk to anyone I want”. I honestly was already leaving him at this point. I was angry because he wouldn’t defend me. I was angry because he didn’t realise how much trauma I had from the betrayal and the cheating reminder by him opening a door for him back to our lives. I was angry because the man I thought I want to have a future with would atleast have my back from people that are this oppressive & misogynistic. \n\nI told him to keep his friends. That I will not tolerate the disrespect. And he clearly doesn’t respect me or what I felt before so I’m just done. He apologised profusely. He said he won’t talk to him again. Blocked him again. But I honestly don’t know now. I have trouble trusting him again. I love him and I feel that I’m in this too deep. This man has met my family. We welcomed him to our lives. We live together. We’ve travelled together. We got flights booked again to travel soon.\n\nI don’t know what to do anymore. I don’t know if I could trust him again. He said we all make mistakes & it was a stupid impulsive mistake on his end because he’s known him for over 10 years, he just wondered how he’s been. i feel like he put his friends first before me. I’m scared that he has the same attitude as his friend. I’m terrified of getting my heart broken again. I cannot just allow this man to have his friend back in when he knows I’m clearly uncomfortable and hurt by what he did. The friend never even apologised. And what hurts the most, J didn’t care about it. He’s 32, i thought he would be more mature. I need advice. \n\n\n",

And today when I was leaving for work he asked if I was okay because I was \"walking in circles.\" I don't think I was, but I did walk back for a second because I didn't hear what he said when I was leaving. I also dropped something in front of him and he laughed and asked why that always happens around him. He also said I was in his way when we were working together. He also pretends to throw stuff at me then laughs and says he is joking and would never do that lol And he didn't care if I were to delete his phone number. He just said \"Well I can't stop you.\" But then after that he talked about how he'd love to take me home and how good I probably taste\n\nIs this some form of playful flirting? Sometimes I just feel sad or like he is laughing at me. He still always says hi to me and smiles and laughs. Maybe he's mad I didn't sleep with him? He never looks mad, but I don't know how to interpret his joking.\n\nTL;DR my coworker makes jokes to me and I'm not sure how to respond or interpret it",

He is an adrenaline junkie, so part of me thinks that is some of what he gets out of this. Just the little secret thrill. Also to be clear, this woman doesn’t work for him. She is a sale rep of a company he relies on heavily. So it benefits her to keep him happy. I don’t think she wants my husband, I think she likes the attention and like that he gives her business. \n\n\n\n\nMe (42f) and him (45m) married 14 years. have been married to my husband for 14 years and known him for almost 26. We have three kids and both run successful business (his bigger then mine). I honestly thought we had a great marriage until about a year ago.\n\nHe got a new sales rep for his company who was a young hot 20 something. I immediately didn’t love it. I don’t know it was vibes or intuition. I voiced my concern to my husband and mostly let it go. For his work he occasionally travels for conferences and she was at a few of them.\n\nFast forward a year and he has one in a tropical location and she will be there. He goes and I don’t know I felt off the whole time. The day he returned I looked at his phone and found they had been texting on her personal phone. She had roaches in her room, and the hotel sprayed for them. It smelled bad. My husband offered for her to come to his room, then she said no and he said we could switch rooms and he said no. I found this text and flipped out. To me this was just a huge boundary violation. We ended up having a huge fight where he ended up the angry one cause I looked at his phone and then hashed out a bunch of shit that he was mad about.\n\nWe fought a few times and then tried to connect again. I then had travel for my work, we left on what I thought was good terms. Right before that we had both met with a therapist separately to see if we should do marital counseling. I know he has super negative feelings towards therapy so I decided just I was going to go. I have my own issues like anxiety. While I was away on my trip the therapist and I talked and decided I was going to see her. I didn’t share that with my husband right away, and again he flipped out. When I got home he pretty much told me he was thinking about moving out. He was so angry with me. He ended up moving to our guest room. He stayed there for a few weeks until his mom was coming up and needed the guest room. He moved back in and things seemed better. Then I caught him in a dumb lie about medication. We both flipped out. He again then said he was done and saw no path forward. The following day he sent me a long text and said he wanted to try. We had a big talk- and things were better. Then the next day he was supposed to go to a nearby city with a sales rep and others to see a baseball game and stay over. He never mentioned this woman was going. Lo and behold I see on insta she is at the same game. I call him and flip out. He comes home the next day and apologizes. We talk and want to make it work.\n\nWe have some weeks of things being much better. He doesn’t want to discuss anything about what has happened. I did tell him I want him to limit contact as much as possible especially on her personal phone. He agrees. Then I find a few weeks later they were texting and he was deleting messages (this was last week). I loose my mind. He claims she is a good friend, there is nothing going on, he deletes because he knows I am going to get mad. Nothing is happening. Truthfully I don’t think anything physical has happened. But I think there is boundaries being violated and tell him that it is the start of an emotional affair. He is very angry about that. We try and make up over the next few days. He is telling me when he talks to her etc. and I just have a feeling it’s not true. I end up telling him I checked the phone bill (which I don’t have access too) and saw he talked to her. He admits to it, but more of the same, I do it because of this reaction. Now I didn’t actually look at the phone bill. I just guessed. He looses his shit. Screaming telling me to fuck off. That I violated him and I don’t even want to try and make this work.  He is now done.\n\nHe is so angry with ME. I know that I lied and was deceitful but like what the heck man, you keep lying to me about the girl I told you I was worried about. I don’t even know what to do now.  Do you think this is salvageable? We were like the dream couple of our community. And honestly I was so happy and content with him. I feel like everything has fallen apart so fast.\n\nTLDR- huge disagreement over a relationship with a younger woman. I don’t think anything physical has happened but I am uncomfortable with where it’s headed. Instead of understanding husband is angry with me.",

      "title": "BF (35M) isn’t sure we can be together because of my weight - what to do? (27F)",
      "content": "BF and I have been together for around a year and a half since we met in grad school, and have basically been living together. It has been the dream relationship - we’re best friends, love to be with each other all the time, never fight, are respectful of each other, support each other through difficult times, have shared goals in life, have similar personalities, have good communication (or at least, I thought), and basically have so much fun being together.   I couldn’t even imagine life without him anymore. \n\nAround a year ago I got news that I got accepted into a year-long study abroad program. At first, he was distraught at the idea of losing me. Since we had only been dating for a few months at that point, I wasn’t able to say if we would stay together during my study abroad or not - it was too far in the future and I wanted to wait and see. But he even suggested going abroad with me. So we proceeded with the assumption that we would probably try to find a way to make it work out, but wouldn’t focus on it until the time came.\n\nLife went on and like said, it was the dream relationship. We spent every day together, made lots of beautiful memories, and I even stayed with his family for two weeks over Christmas (I was the first girl he had introduced to them, or even dated, since 2018). I felt on top of the world.\n\nThen, a few months ago, I felt like he was becoming a little distant. We stopped being intimate, but otherwise, everything was great as before. \n\nSince I’m studying abroad in two months, I finally brought up the subject again last week. I love him so much and would be more than willing to make our relationship work long distance. And honestly, remembering his initial reaction, I was sure he felt the same way too.\n\nI was shocked by his response. First, he said he wanted to wait and see. “Wait and see for what?”, I asked, - we’ve been together for over a year, you should know how you feel about me. After I pushed him, he said that he wasn’t sure that we would be together either way. “What does that mean??” He admitted that he was no longer attracted to me because I gained weight. This didn’t really surprise me, because weight is something I’ve been really struggling with for two years due to the mental health strain of grad school. I’m a lot heavier than when I met him, and I know that our intimacy suffered because of it. I’ve been incredibly insecure about my weight as well and it’s definitely one of my goals to lose it. He knows this and acknowledges that I’ve been taking small steps so far to lose weight and be healthy, which is was incredibly kind and supportive about. So for me, I saw this as a temporary problem that I am willing to fix both for my sake and his sake.\n\nI told him that I would make an effort starting immediately if that was important to him. But I was still confused about the status of our relationship. I asked him if he loved me, and if he even cared about being with me. After a long, painful pause, he barely said anything but I felt like he was indifferent and wasn’t able to say that he loved me. I was shocked because not once in our relationship did I doubt that he loved me. \n\nI took some time to think and resumed the conversation the next day. I told him that I was confused because he said that he’s indifferent, doesn’t know if he loves me, but still continues to act in the same loving way as before. I said I didn’t want to feel like this and I needed clarity on our relationship before I go abroad. Again, after a long, painful pause, he said that he wasn’t indifferent and didn’t not love me, but didn’t think we would work out because he doesn’t think I can lose weight. He said that it is truly the only issue bothering him - otherwise, I am the perfect girlfriend.\n\nI’m deeply hurt by the fact that he can’t really say he loves me anymore - this came out of nowhere and was the last thing I ever expected. I told him that I was willing to make changes to save our relationship (losing weight), but that he also had to figure out his feelings and make efforts to stop being distant and to communicate again. I feel like I should break up with him because this is so disrespectful, but it’s also such a shame to throw away a great relationship with someone I love for what I see as a temporary and fixable issue. \n\nI almost broke up with him last night, but he is continuing to act as the same perfect, loving boyfriend as before so I’m confused. He said that he didn’t want to break up, but wants to wait and see.\n\nI need advice on how to proceed. I’m so torn and devastated.\n\nTLDR: BF of 1 year+ suddenly isn’t sure if he wants to continue our relationship anymore when I move abroad because I gained weight. He seems indifferent and can’t say he loves me, which is a complete shock. He wants to act like everything is normal and wait and see. Stay to fix the issues or break up?\n\nEDITS to respond to some comments. \n\nFor the people asking, I went from 130 to 170 at 5’6. I truly don’t look or feel great but I’m far from having health issues or keeping up an active lifestyle. If anything, I’ve always been the one asking him to go on walks or work out together. He’s known since the beginning that I’ve struggled with weight for a long time (childhood issues leading to an eating disorder, and then grad school exacerbating it). He’s always been supportive of me getting healthy, and encouraged me to see the doctor and go to therapy. I have taken these steps but unfortunately haven’t made progress yet because we were both preoccupied with grad school. Despite this, he’s always called me beautiful and treated me so nicely. Besides the lack of intimacy over the past few months and a little bit more distance (which I originally thought was just a result of us spending every single day together), I would not have known at all that his feelings changed. It was a complete shock that during our conversation, not once did he emphasize that he loved me or wanted to be with me. After I asked if he was already completely checked out of the relationship, he said not completely, and that he was midway between indifference and wanting to be with me… He doesn’t want to break up now, but wants to wait and see (probably to see if he will be attracted to me again). I understand attraction is important but I’m really concerned that he seems to not love me anymore (despite acting the same as before).",

      "title": "My (24F) husband (26M) hasn’t had sex with me in over 7 months",
      "content": "*throw away account because my husband follows me on Reddit * \nMe (24F) and my husband (26M) have been married for 4 years this husband. We met in college and have been together ever since. We both grew up very religious, so we never had sex until we were engaged. Because it was so “scandalous” for us to do and we didn’t want to get in trouble, it only happened a handful of times before we got married. When we got married, I think we had sex maybe 3 times during that first week. I was not really aware that my husband had such a low sex drive until after we got married, which sucks because mine is so high. \nFlash forward 4 years and we’ve had sex less than 30 times (definitely less than 50). I used to ask my husband frequently if we could, but after being denied so often I got embarrassed and turned off that part of my brain towards him. It’s gotten to the point where I don’t even feel comfortable kissing him. Quick forehead or cheek kisses are really all we do. He is my best friend and an amazing provider for us (we both work full time, but he’s better at “adulting” lol). The only thing is my romantic and emotional needs aren’t met. \nThis is exasperated by the fact that I realized I was bisexual just a few months before we got married. I’ve never been able to explore that part of myself, but I ache for it more and more each day. I’ve never had an orgasm with my husband, only achieved it alone, but I imagine that I’d be able to have one if I was with a woman. Instead, when I do get sex, it’s with a silent partner who gets dressed right after he’s done and then goes on his phone. I recently asked him why and he did finally admit he’s less attracted to me than he used to be as I “basically doubled in size”. Now when I work up the courage to ask him for sex I get super embarrassed after he says no and feel ashamed for even asking. \nI’m not a perfect partner, and I know I could be more helpful around the house with chores and responsibilities, but it sucks to feel so alone in your marriage. I’m too young to be miserable. We talk about this problem every now and then (I’m the only one to bring it up) and he basically just says sorry and that we need to “restart” with all of our intimacy so we feel comfortable being together. Nothing happens. We both want to get into couples therapy but haven’t done so yet (I know that it’s the best solution and not just going to Reddit). \nI guess I’m just frustrated because I feel alone, depressed, and unsatisfied and I’m not even 25. We just bought our first house together, we have a dog, and our goal was to start trying for kids soon. I don’t see myself being a parent with anyone else, but I also can’t keep going on like this. It’s not fair, right? It’s weird?",

      "content": "I may just be trying to put this into words solely for myself, but any advice would be greatly appreciated. I apologize that this is so long.\n\nMy girlfriend wishes I called her more often, the only problem is I don't want to talk to her on the phone.... My issue is that we don't really talk about anything. I'm sure I'll sound like a jerk when saying this but her topics are always how bad things are going for her at that moment usually in terms of family, sicknesses, or friend stuff... and it's tiring.\n\nFor context: her family does indeed suck, she does indeed get sick often, and she always seems to be going through some sort of beef with one of her friends (though I think it tends to be one-sided). She's just one of those people who subconsciously let one bad thing ruin their whole day. Additionally, she likes really long phone calls; it's never just a quick hello how are you, it's expected to end only when one of us has something to do.\n\nBut before I go any further, I'd like to clarify that my girlfriend is amazing in so many ways, I love her very much, and I generally really enjoy talking to her lol. We currently live together, though I'm writing this while on a solo visit with family that was unexpectedly extended. Hence why phone calls have been so frequent recently.\n\nBut it's getting to the point where I have nothing to say or bring to the conversation because all I can think about is how much I don't want to be on the phone. I have to try really hard to come up with topics that aren't just bleh updates on my day, and I'm having an incredibly hard time keeping conversations going. Whenever there's a break in conversation, it goes back to her common theme... I just don't want to hear about how much her family sucks for the millionth time, I don't want to hear about another congested nose or a sore throat that she won't take something to help, and I don't want to hear about something her friend said that I am positive she is just taking out of context.\n\nI feel that I can't say I want to end the call because that really upsets her (as I said earlier she likes the extended calls). I often have work I need to be doing, but if I focus on my work all day she gets upset. I've tried to be on video calls with her while working, but if I'm not paying attention to her she gets upset. Folks, it's getting a little tiring, and it feels like it's detrimental to my mental image of her even when we're together.\n\nI really want to be excited when I see an incoming call and not feel the dread I currently do. I feel like I'm boring or rude because I just sit there and nod and say \"I'm sorry honey that sucks\". In reality, it DOES suck and I AM sorry she has to deal with things like that so often, and I want to be here to help her through it... but man... tell me something positive sometimes. I feel like I've asked all the questions I can ask and offered all the ideas I can think of without forcing advice on her, but it's the same thing over and over. The conversations don't last very long, but we don't hang up when they're over. Unfortunately this has already begun crossing over into text. I feel I'm becoming more and more reclusive and communicating so much less.\n\nWe're about to do a really big move cross country together and begin a huge next chapter in our lives, but I'm worried. Could what I'm feeling be a sign that we're incompatible?",

Come in best friend lets call him Ricky A. He recently went through a breakup and I helped him through it, and he kinda helped me. After we ended things saddle hit up Rickys DM's, and I knew they were talking just at friends at the moment. I was suspicious that things weren't as i though they were as I asked him on several occasions about it and he never gave straightforward answers, rather just said its not that deep and I shouldn't really worry about it. In the friend group i shared with Ricky some of the other guys also thought was weird. The friend in the friend group that Ricky was closest with kept telling Ricky what he was doing was really messed up and he shouldn't keep texting saddle. But all everybody knew was that they were just texting. Cut to yesterday I went on my usual run as i would and I caught Saddle and Ricky holding hands on a walk. Ricky later texted me about it and said he was sorry that he made a mistake and that he didn't mean to( obviously more lies as if he didn't mean to he wouldn't. Saddle herself had some bad dating history with other guys and Ricky knew about this, especially as she had thrown me into the dumps. I blocked him and went to the team, the whole group was shaken and is still currently discussing on how we should handle the situation. We've never had quite the problem and this is the first time something big like this has happened. We have been keeping this between us for now but don't know what to do from here. Am I the insane one here or what?",

      "content": "My mom is an alcoholic. She is dying from a condition that can be attributed to her alcoholism, but also could be because of her being obese and a diabetic. The doctors don’t know the cause. \n\nShe didn’t start drinking until I was in my later teen years. It wasn’t anything too crazy, but it was about 4-5 drinks per night, sometimes with the odd night off. She quit when she got her diagnosis about 3 years ago. So she was drinking for about 10 years. \n\nShe is dying. When she got the diagnosis, we knew she would die from it. But she did some treatments that extended her life. But at this point, she will die soon. She lives with me and is in a lot of pain and discomfort. I am her main caretaker, but do have occasional help from my family. \n\nWhen it started getting bad, she told me she wants some wine. I haven’t bought her any, I feel dirty doing it knowing her past. But I know she has had some bottles delivered and has drank them. She will have a couple glasses in a day maybe 2-3 times per week and hasn’t tried to hide it. She says it helps with the pain and helps her sleep. \n\nMy older sister came over for a visit recently and found out about this. She laid into me about how I am letting her do this and how I should take away her access to DoorDash so she doesn’t order any. I don’t feel comfortable doing that. My mom is an adult and she is dying. She’s using her own money and if I take away DoorDash, it keeps her from getting food if I am working and she’s hungry. She isn’t strong enough to cook, so sometimes she orders food for herself. I do cook for her, but sometimes she doesn’t want the leftovers so she orders food. \n\nShe told the rest of the family and they are all mad that I am allowing her to kill herself because drinking isn’t recommended with her condition. I’ve already been torn between “you shouldn’t let an alcoholic have alcohol” and “she’s dying anyways, let her have some relief”. And I settled on I won’t enable it by buying it for her, but if she does it herself, I’m not going to stop her. I’m trying to let her have less pain as she slowly dies. \n\nBut my family is very mad at me. Some still think she could recover if she doesn’t drink, but that’s just not true. Others think I’m letting her drink to kill her faster. I’ve been called abusive and neglectful. Someone even threatened to call adult protective services. I am basically being pushed out of the family, even by those I have always been very close to and love a lot. \n\nHow can I balance letting my mom execute her free will as a dying adult and my families expectations and wants about her life without damaging my relationship with my mother?",

Because I’ve never lived in the US and I’m not fluent in English.\n\nAnyway thank you for leaving comments I broke up with him because I found out he’s been using Hinge😂",

      "content": "Apologies for the throw away account but i have to many family members and colleagues that know my main account and i will be keeping something vague for privacy.\n\nIt's basically as my title says. A friend kissed me in our kitchen and my husband saw. \n\nMy husband for this post I'll call him John and i have been married for 2 years now, together for 5 years. i love him more than anything. He is more than i deserve, to me he is perfect. I don't mean to prop him up but he is everthing and more i have ever wanted in a partner. I have never cheated on my husband and never even taught about it. I have not flirted with anyone and i keep myself out of situation that can be misinterpreted by anyones.\n\nFriday night we had a BBQ at our house, and we invited a couple of friends. One of the people that we invited was the brother of my best friend, I'll call him Dan for this post and my best friend his sister I'll call Ellen. Dan and i aren't close, I'll call him a friend but like distant friends not really close. I got to know him during my friendship with Ellen. We also got to talking the last couple of weeks as he is wanting to transition to a similar field I'm in and Ellen sasked me to help him out, i didn't see a problem with it as i was in that field for a brief period and untill i switched over to the management side so i have alot of insight.\n\nI have to add, all our text was about work, his transition from one to the other, what he needs to do, look out for nothing inappropriate, no late night talks or flirting nothing. \n\nI did tell my husband about it and no reddit it's not that i had to check in with him or inform him I'm talking to another man. He asked how my day was and i told him about Ellen request. He didn't pry or anything but in the interest of transparency and me needing advice, my husband did say to be on my guard around Dan. I did ask him why, and he said he just doesn't trust Dan no specific reason as to why just a feeling on his part.\n\nLike i said we had a BBQ and i was in the kitchen busy, Dan was in the kitchen with me and we were talking about work because he was actively in the transition and i was juat clearing something up for him that will be required out of nowhere Dan came up to me and kissed me right at the moment my husband came into the kitchen from the back yard, i completely froze up. I don't know if Dan timed it or what but looking back it's doesn't make sense to me. My husband grabbed Dan and threw him around the kitchen it took 2 of the guys to get John off of Dan. My husband really hurt him. \n\nAfter that the BBQ was ruined, and Ellen took Dan home, don't know what is currently going on as Ellen isn't awnsering my calls or text and i blocked Dan number.\n\nHere is my dilemma, my husband hasn't been himself at all, he is completely quiet and shut off. He hasn't blamed me, he hasn't accused me of cheating or doing anything inappropriate, he hasn't asked about any of my interactions with Dan, or to see the text which i still have i haven't deleted anything from any of our conversation, he isn't angry at me, he isn't shirt with me, he hasn't yelled at me, nothing. Although John hasn't accused me or anything i have found him observing me like a hawk on multiple occasions, it's almost as if every move of mine is being studied. \n\nI know i need to talk to him about the situation and it's on me for not doing that yet. I just don't know how to go about it without it looking like damage control. i need seriously help. ",

      "content": "We had a good sex life until we got married and then he began being the one to withhold and when I'd push for it, he'd say messed up crap like I'm a nympho, sex-addict, etc. because I wanted intimacy 2-3 times a week during our honeymoon phase. He was having some health/anxiety problems, but that sh\\*t still got under my skin. Over the years, I've become the exact opposite but I've never been able to initiate. It's been shot down every time. His drive has improved here and there, but nothing lasting.\n\nNow we have two kids, and we have sex like.. once or twice a month. We could make time for sex but I seriously just don't feel like it anymore. I think most of his past experiences were just hook-ups and that's exactly what our sex life feels like, a series of non-emotionally involved hook-ups. There's no connection, it always goes the same way and it literally feels like I should be calling an Uber after we're done.\n\nHe's also incredibly arrogant lately. He makes every conversation about himself, talks himself up all the time, has zero issue making jokes at my expense, farts in my direction all the time, dominates every conversation, talks over people, etc. It makes me not want to be around him, hence no way for intimacy to begin. He doesn't seem to have a problem with this.\n\nPhysically I'm still attracted to him and I'm willing to try putting aside a lot of this to work on our intimacy because I think having that in our marriage would improve a lot of the other dumb crap overall, but I'm not interested in putting forth effort for sex that has me feeling ashamed of myself, in my head and blah afterward (I've gained weight, so that doesn't help thing either) especially when he already seems so in love with himself right now. We both show little to no interest in sex anymore.\n\nIs there any fixing this? Or is this the path to a sexless marriage?",

      "content": "I've never posted on here before so apologies if this is formatted incorrectly or anything. I'm from the UK and my husband is American. We met in the UK and have been married for four years. We have lived in the US since 2022. He has a large family here, whereas my parents have passed and my brother moved away from the UK years ago so at the time is made sense to move here to be closer to family. We have an infant, and having his family around is super helpful and I really appreciate them a lot. However, prior to moving here I had only visited the more touristy areas of America (Orlando, NYC, LA and Seattle). When we first moved here we lived in a major city, but we moved last year and where we live now is more rural and in the south of the USA (close to his hometown so we'd be close to his family), which I wasn't super familiar with. I grew up in London, and I think I'm just starting to really struggle with being homesick or I'm experiencing culture shock. I'm feeling extremely anxious all the time, and I just really want to go home. Also I work in healthcare which is changing rapidly right now, and I don't have the same satisfaction in my work at all.\n\nI spoke to my husband about these feelings, and he doesn't think it makes any sense for us to uproot our lives and move to a country where I have no family when we have a large family here. I appreciate his family a lot, but I don't really agree with them on a lot of things that they are becoming increasingly vocal about and I feel very outnumbered and uncomfortable a lot of the time. He thinks I'm overreacting and that we are perfectly fine here. He's suggested that I might have post-partum depression, and that I should talk to someone which I'm in the process of doing. However, I still feel like my feelings on this are a huge wedge between us right now and don't know how to move past it in a healthy way?",

      "content": "\nI’m posting here because I don’t know what else to do and I don’t have anyone to talk to about all of this and I just need some advice. Using a throw away due to my exes use of Reddit, I will also change a few small details in relation to names, dates, etc to avoid obvious identifiers. \n\nI feel absolutely trapped and stuck right now. I’ve been with the mother of my kids for over a decade, since I was a teenager. Over that decade we’ve been through quite a lot of issues relating to her infidelity, mental instability and issues with finances, even physical abuse in some cases. (I’ve never been physical with her). That’s not to say I haven’t made mistakes as well, I have, but I feel the level of mistakes we’ve both made are so disproportionate but are made out by her to be equivalent. There have been so many issues that anyone including myself when I have the wherewithal to think logically about it, would run, not walk, away from. \n\nMy problem has always been that I have a deep seated issue relating to my own self worth and my desire to please those around me and not to disappoint. As a result of these issues, I found myself continually forgiving these normally relationship destroying betrayals time after time. I’m terrified of being alone because I already feel isolated as it is and if I lose her too I truly will have nobody left.\n\nRight now we are in a place where we have multiple children together and are trying to make things work civilly between us due to a recent incident of her lying, gaslighting me and then cheating on me only to have me come pick her up after she was done not knowing what she’d just been doing. There was also recent case of her physically abusing me, leaving deep scratches and scrapes all over me that thankfully only happened when all the children were asleep and fortunately they didn’t witness any of it. She claims she wants to work on things and make our marriage work but I do not trust her and I know that I never will again, I know that her main priority at the end of the day will always be herself and I’m never going to hold a position of respect or love in her life, all I am to her is a tool, a means to a paycheck and shit getting done. \n\nI know my own inability to let go and walk away is largely what’s put me in this untenable position. I know that I’ve forgiven her time and time again because I desperately wanted my children to have parents who were together and love each other. That’s always been my dream and goal for them is to grow up in a happy, healthy, and loving environment. Unfortunately I’ve allowed that desire to triumph over my own logic in that I know staying with her will only lead to more hurt and betrayal. Theres a lot more I could go into for examples but some are so specific that it would be obvious who I am if I started listing them and privacy is a big concern for me. \n\nRight now my issue is that I am stuck because she has financially controlled me so much that I haven’t been able to afford to pay off a couple speeding tickets I had, which ended up snowballing into a license suspension due to me not paying. Now I’m in a position where I don’t have a license, don’t have the money to pay to reinstate it, but never have the freedom or time to work on rectifying any of those issues because my entire life is waking up, getting the kids off to school, going to work, coming home and taking care of them until they go to bed because my partner gets angry with me if I have to leave the house for anything besides work, or groceries or something she needs. Me not having a valid license gives her a lot of leverage over me because she knows I’ll never leave my kids behind because theyre everything to me but she knows I won’t take them out in my van illegally because even if I were comfortable risking it to get away, she would use it as leverage and report me immediately. Not to mention I need to maintain the job I’m at currently as not much else around my area pays as good with the flexibility in hours that I need to be able to care for my children. \n\nI just don’t know what to do. I don’t have any friends, I don’t talk to any of my family much anymore because I think they’ve all written me off due to my constantly forgiving her for the things she’s done to me. They’ve watched me be hurt so many times that they stopped caring which I don’t blame them for one bit. I don’t want to split our family apart I just want us to be together but I don’t see how we can do that when she continues treating me the way she does. I’m not even allowed to talk about how I feel without being made to feel like a loser and less of a man. I just don’t know what to do and I feel completely alone. \n\nThank you for listening, I apologize if I don’t respond quickly, I am bouncing between work and fatherly duties so please forgive me, just know I will read all comments in search of some wise words of advice. Be as harsh as you want I hear worse in my own head on a daily basis.",

      "content": "Hi everyone. As the title states, boyfriend of 5 years broke up with me last night. I’m moving about 30 mins away from where I currently am, which is only 10 extra minutes from him, but he can’t handle the idea of me moving out. Apparently he wanted to start saving for a house, which I didn’t know. There’s more details but I’m absolutely devastated. The reason for my move is because of a family emergency. So it’s not necessarily a happy reason. I feel like my life is falling apart. He told me I’m the only person he’ll ever be with and even though we’re breaking up now we’ll find our way back to each other. He said he will never be in a relationship again unless it’s with me. How can you put that weight on someone after literally breaking their heart? He ended up staying the night after breaking up with me and he just left for work and I’m just left so utterly devastated and confused and I don’t know what to do. How do you guys handle breakups where both parties still love each other so much?\n\nI’m adding this: So about the house thing, when I first realized I had to move out, I approached him and asked if he thinks we’re ready to move in together. He said no, because he doesn’t think I am financially responsible yet. However, I still needed to move out. He requested that I don’t move into the city (even though he lives in the city) and that I don’t move in with roommates that I don’t know already. Well, I had to do both of those things. I needed to move out and I don’t know anyone personally who is looking to do that right now. So I found an awesome group of three people on Facebook who are in the same career field as me. It’s literally the perfect fit for me and my career. My now ex-boyfriend didn’t like that. Thats when he pulls the “Well I wanted us to start saving for a house yada yada” even though there was no chatter about that before. So he broke up with me. ",

      "content": "My boyfriend (M26) and I (F24) have been together for 5 years and he is being weird about marriage. \nWe’ve talked extensively about having children in the future, buying a house together, and have even discussed how we want to handle finances after getting married. I thought we were ready to move forward in our relationship but he told me months ago that he will not propose until he had $10,000 saved. I didn’t agree with that number but he would not budge. \n\nThe discussion about marriage came up a few weeks ago and he caught me off guard. I showed him a video of someone talking about elopement because I know a big wedding would be overwhelming for him and he lashed out. He told me that he would dread whatever we do to get married because he hates having attention on him. This honestly upset me a bit but I tried to let it go and move on. I’m not someone that needs a huge wedding but I’ve always looked forward to celebrating the love I have with someone and it was a bummer to hear that he didn’t feel the same way.\n\nI tried talking to him about it again but he had genuine anger about the topic. I dug deeper and tried asking if he had talked to his therapist about why he was so upset about it and it was revealed that he ghosted his therapist 6 months ago. Obviously I wasn’t particularly thrilled about this fact. He eventually opened up and said that he doesn’t have an emotional attachment to getting married and he’s upset that it isn’t exciting like most people tell him it should be. The number he gave me was just a goal because he doesn’t have emotions telling him that it’s time. I once again tried to let it go until he had a chance to talk to a therapist about it. \n\nHis parents brought up us getting married this past weekend and he told them that he wasn’t looking forward to a wedding and to try and make myself feel a bit better I said something along the lines of “At least you’ll enjoy asking me” to which he replied “that’s not the word I would use.”\n\nI genuinely don’t know if I’m crazy for wanting to stay with him and work this out. He made an appointment with his therapist to talk about this but he’s saying that he doesn’t feel ready and can’t name a single reason as to why he isn’t ready. He’s had a ring given to him by his family for around 3 years now but hasn’t made much progress on a proposal plan from what he’s told me.\n\nI’m not upset that he hasn’t proposed yet but I’m incredibly upset at his behavior towards marrying me. I’ve had to make sacrifices in this relationship but I wasn’t expecting to have to reduce my expectations to near zero regarding getting married. All I want is a chance to marry someone I love, wear a pretty dress, and have good photos that I can appreciate later down the line. It doesn’t feel like I’m asking too much but I’ve been wrong before. \n\nTLDR: my boyfriend dreads getting married and I don’t know if I should put up with it",

      "title": "My girlfriend (26F) of 1 year hid a cosmetic procedure from me (27M). What perspective might I be missing?",
      "content": "I've been with my girlfriend for a little over a year and I love her very much. But I recently discovered several things that she hid from me that are concerning to me:\n\n1. I was out of the country traveling for 2 weeks with my friend about a month ago. While I was gone, she got surgery on her Eyelids (Blepharoplasty) purely for cosmetic reasons, without telling me. When she FaceTimed me while was traveling, she was wearing dark glasses and lied and said she was covering an eye infection. When I got back I noticed discoloration around her eyes, which she said was from the infection, which seemed odd but I let it go. But I noticed there was still scaring several weeks later and asked about it again, and she got mad and said to drop it. I finally looked up the symptoms, and got a clear answer that it was the result of eyelid surgery. I brought this up and she finally admitted to it, but had no explanation for hiding it from me other than that she was embarrassed.\n2. I recently noticed a Herpes antiviral medication in her supplement drawer that was open. Admittedly, I should've made more of a conscious effort not to read the label on any pill bottles there, but I saw it sitting there and was already familiar with what that medication was for. She has never told me about having Herpes. I understand that it's not a big deal, that most people have it (HSV-1), and that it is way over-stigmatized. And it's not transmissible while she's on the medication, so technically there was no reason for her to have needed to tell me. But it still feels like something she should've mentioned at some point in the past year (we have unprotected sex).\n3. While discussing the two things above, she also let slip that about 6 months ago she ordered Semaglutide GLP-1 (generic Ozempic) from a sketchy online operation and had been taking it. I think GLP-1s are an amazing tool to help people genuinely struggling with obesity, but my girlfriend is a totally healthy weight. I know the medications she takes are not my business, but this is concerning to me because 1. there is no medical reason for her to be taking it 2. while there are some legit, totally safe sellers of online semaglutide, injecting herself with something from a sketchy seller was putting her safety at risk without any medical necessity. She also didn't tell me about this before because she was embarrassed.\n\nI have 2 big concerns after all of this:\n\n1. Trust - I now feel like she has no qualms hiding things from me. This could be a real issue in the future if it was something more serious. \n2. Body Modification - My girlfriend got lip injections several months ago; she got this eyelid surgery I mentioned; she was injecting herself with powerful weight loss medication despite being a healthy weight. It seems to me she has zero reservations about any sort of body modification or experimentation. I am trying to be open-minded and respect her autonomy to do what she wants with her body, but frankly I feel like there's something really upsetting about her desire for these procedures. I love her just the way she is, she is already so beautiful and I've told her this. So far these are relatively minor things she's done, but I'm worried that she has some level of body dysmorphia and that this is a slippery slope she is on, that she will continue to get more and more unnecessary work done (all of which has risk) without asking or wanting my opinion. I would find it so unattractive if she were to get plastic surgery that significantly changed her appearance.\n\nCan you all provide some different perspectives on this? This all feels wrong to me, but maybe I'm overreacting and not being empathetic to her feelings and privacy about her body? She has so many amazing qualities and I don't want this to be a big issue, but I'm feeling worked up and scared.",

He’s been extremely patient and understanding of my boundaries. The day after we became official he left to another city to visit his family for his birthday week. The night before his birthday i stayed up excited to wish him a happy birthday and I opened his instagram story to see he had posted a stupid comment about “knowing there’s a pretty girl somewhere in the city that needs head” I felt that it was insanely disrespectful and honestly a deal breaker especially since we are so so so early in the relationship ( ONLY ONE WEEK OFFICIALLY !!) and he insisted it was a complete joke and he isn’t looking for anyone else. I guess i’m wondering if I should look past it just this once since he has otherwise been the perfect gentleman ? On the other hand the relationship is so early and the fact that he’s so comfortable being disrespectful is very concerning. I know this probably sounds immature and petty but I’m genuinely at a loss with how to approach this. I feel super grossed out with him and i’m worried i won’t be able to see him the same.\nUPDATE: some info i forgot\nhe removed the post within a few minutes and at the end of the day i KNOW i deserve better i guess im more so looking for advice on how to end things without the guilt of remembering how good he was to me before this. I feel immature for ending things over this when he’s been such a great guy :/ He also apologized and told me he wasn’t looking for anything else. I don’t understand why i feel so guilty over ending things \nUPDATE: while taking some space from him and trying to figure out how to end things, he posted a public video of some random girl in his car in the middle of the night\nso i ended things immediately. i don’t think he realizes what he did wrong cz the girl “has a bf” but i still stood on business and ended things 🫡\n\n",

I'm not saying this is necessarily relevant, but she was somewhat intoxicated as well and had been drinking while we were on the phone as well as at the dinner before. She says that she kinda wants to Uber over to my place now instead of waiting until tomorrow (which is really \"today\" given it's 2am) because she really wants to see me. The first thing I said in response to this idea were these exact words \"It might be difficult to find an Uber right now.\"\n\nThat response was immediately considered to mean that I did not want to see her. I told her that absolutely was not my intention with that response. (Which is true, I would not mind her coming over at that hour. A week or two ago we had tried to order an Uber around this time and the guy showed up and then immediately sped off and cancelled the ride and we could not find another Uber.) I assure her she is absolutely welcome to come over, but she tells me that I am just saying that only to make up for disappointing her with my first response. Then she tells me that she feels stupid that she is literally willing to get an Uber at 2am to come over and that I am not reciprocating the same level of interest. I try to tell her that my comment about the Uber does not mean that I do not want to see her, without giving any criticism whatsoever as to how my words made her feel.\n\nWe decided eventually to just go to sleep and stop the back and forth. I tell her I love her and goodnight and she does not respond, but instead nods her head and hangs up. I then texted her \"Nothing like a head nod in response to selling someone you love them.\" Then she texts back saying she loves me very much and would pack a bag and come over right now if it was something I wanted but that it \"seems not.\" I tell her I love her and want to spend time with her. I say \"I do want it I am just worried about your safety getting here and also the disappointment when the Uber driver speeds off.\" To which, she responds that she would not be averse to finding if she can get an Uber rn but that she has \"overplayed her hand and doesn't think it's okay now.\"\n\nI then tell her, \"I feel like any time I voice a legitimate practical worry that detracts from excitement that I run the risk of being accused of being less enthusiastic or less interested.\" (For context, I have a well documented history of anxiety that I have been going to therapy for for a long time, spoken at length about with her, and frequently offer authentic discussions about my experience with anxiety. It's pretty well under control these days.)\n\nHer response to that was this: \"I mean maybe it has to do with the fact that you act like such a wet blanket and I'm not really sure whether it's that you don't want to see me or that you're worried about logistics. I'm offering to haul myself to you and you're still not 100% onboard and it makes me feel stupid.\"\n\nI tell her \"I'm not going to have an argument over text. (Something I have already communicated after previous arguments, to her agreement). Sorry for worrying about your safety.\" She \"replies\" specifically to that message and says \"This is cruel.\". I ask her \"Do you still want to hangout tomorrow?\", to which she responds \"You're so existential it's shocking. Fine. No I don't want to hangout tomorrow. Is that what you want to hear? And blame it on the fact that I had a little to drink tonight?\"\n\nI really just said Wtf at that point and that I don't understand where the hostility is coming from. I tell her I hope we can talk about this in the morning. She says \"Are you going to be empathetic? Because it feels like you were not.\"\n\nWe end up calling each other again and talking somewhat calmly and she says that she does still want to come over and stick with our plans. We talked about it after our hike (which was okay but a little tense between us.) I opened the conversation later that day about it and told her it really hurt me being called a wet blanket as it feels like an attack on my personality and, in reality, I felt I have been very agreeable the vast majority of times to spontaneously seeing her (ie. she's in my area of town and wants to stop by which gets a \"I'd love that!\" from me.) I tell her she was telling me what MY intentions were with my comment about it being possibly hard to find an Uber and that her response to it did not show any trust in what I SAY my intentions are. She apologized for the hostility and I asked her what she is thinking in that moment when she decides to call me a wet blanket and lacking empathy and such other criticisms. She says that she was feeling rejected. In validating my feelings about her criticism and assumptions about my intentions, she asks that I do the same thing and validate/understand her feelings of rejection in these moments. I tell her I can absolutely do that but I can't get behind communicating them in the manner that she did especially with comments like calling me a wet blanket in spite of so much contrary evidence. The conversation would feel more safe and less hostile to me if she instead told me how she is feeling (rejected) and we can talk about that and I can listen to why, but I am not going to have my intentions decided for me when only I can know my intentions behind what I say. \n\nThat's kinda where we have left off. This feels like a cyclical occurrence that is happening. It happened a week or two prior in response to me not answering an unscheduled phone call (she had texted right before the phone call \"I am just calling to say good night\" But I had not read that text yet) and apologizing to her via text within about 10 minutes, saying I was in the middle of a conversation with my friends (who I was on a trip with for a friend's wedding). \n\nI like so much about her and in between these types of interactions we have a lot of enjoyable moments. But these interactions leave me feeling worried I am receiving some toxic behavior and I don't know exactly what to make of it.\n\nDoes anybody have advice on how I can (a) Communicate my intentions after my GF quickly assumes them, (b) respond to comments like the wet blanket comment in a way that both acknowledges that they hurt me but encourage her to share the feelings behind them, and/or (c) show my interest in her without feeling like I have to give an artificially enthusiastic response instead of a natural one (like my thought that popped in my head about it possibly being hard to get an Uber).\n\nTLDR: (28F) GF describes my natural responses, which I believe to be of no ill-intent, as rejections and displays of disinterest in her. I want to know if this is a fair judgement to make and whether my level of enthusiasm in my non-explicitly and non-intentionally rejecting responses is something I could or need to improve to show I am interested in someone or whether my knowledge and expression of my intention behind my responses should be considered enough.",

We have 3 beautiful girls and have made a life together. We hit our 13 year anniversary, and I feel like it was the end for me. He didn’t get me flowers, didn’t get me a gift, didn’t do any sweet gestures, we went out for anniversary, I booked the place, I paid cause he didn’t have his card on him or Apple Pay set up, he had drank the champagne and mimosas on an empty stomach so he got tipsy and when I asked for a picture near a cute spot at the restaurant he said he felt to tipsy to walk that way, didn’t take a picture of me, didn’t post me, I had to drive us to the movie after that and I swear while I sat in that movie I felt something in me snap. This man was not going to change, I put in 13 years, no proposal, I had to give up wanting things such as sweet dates, details! I have taken a lot over the years since I met him, and I stayed cause I always had hope. And he’s a great dad, great person, but as a husband man oh man, does he lack. \n\nNow he wants to be good, now he wants to try. Usually he does that, says he will do better but goes back to his old ways after a couple weeks. \n\nFast forward: I was going to leave him so we had a serious sit down, and I told him I was done. He brought up couples therapy, I felt bad, he had just lost his job too that day so I didn’t want to kick him while he was down. But I am not feeling it. I can’t find like true happiness, he kisses me and I feel nothing. I am trying my hardest to try to get the feeling back but it’s not coming. \n\nHas anyone been through this? Any advice? ",

This is because we both study at universities in different countries (same timezone).\n\nThroughout the day we text eachother and send memes, and a part of that routine has been as soon as i get home from school at around 5 pm everyday we videocall eachother.\nNow i love talking to and seeing her, but the calls often go on for hours if not through the night until the next morning where we dont even speak to eachother.\n\nNo big deal, right? It shouldnt but havibg to constantly be available to someone  and talk to them on phone is draining me mentally and emotionally.\nIm very introverted and have even before the relationship always valued my own time where i can just wibd down and be unreachable.\n\nI dont mind calling her daily, i miss her if i dont, but id much rather it be a productive 20 minute cal than an 7 hours slog with barely anything said for minutes at a time.\n\nIt also affects the rest of my life, since im technically preoccupied with calling her.\nIt also heavily limits how i can use my phone and it frequently overheats because its so intensive on the phone to have those long videocalls.\n\nI have tried telling her this, but everytime i do she gets vary sad/upsets and behaves like i dont like her. When i mention i have to go actually starts sobbing, and it makes me feel bad. \nThen she starts complaining and saying that i dont even like her, and it makes me upset cause i want her to behave like an adult.\nWorst part is that if im ever upset she also has to be and more so than me.\n\nThere are several occasions where ive had to leave hangouts ive had with planned with friends early because she was sad she was gonna be alone that night.\n\nThing is im not really good at understanding emotions of myself nor others and dont know if im missing anything from her perspective.\n\nIts to the point where i have to ask her if its ok that i leave to do things.\n\nI on average spend more time with her on call, than any other person in my life on a week to week basis.\n\nI genuinely don't know what to do, because i dont even have the chance to be annoyed at her because she emotionally guilttrips me to being the bad guy. Is there something im missing\nmissing?\nHow do i tell her how i feel without coming across as an asshole?\n\nIt feels as im probably missing crucial points but i feel trapped and wanna do everything to make her happy.\n",

      "title": "How do I [34M] handle what my girlfriend [35F] has said to her friends about me?",
      "content": "So I want to preface this by saying that I’ve been dealing with incredibly debilitating mental health issues, and I’m working with doctors and a therapist and pursuing treatment.\n\nMy partner and I’ve been together for about three years and there’s been a few things that have happened that I’m having trouble getting over and wondering what to do about it.\n\nI’ve been dealing with health issues for a while and the effect it’s had on my mental health has been profound. \n\nAbout a year and a half ago, my partner and I got into an argument and she told me that I’m “not doing anything to better myself”.\nI was a little taken aback because at this time  I was working with doctors, following their treatment plan, implementing lifestyle changes, working with other practitioners and was actively looking for a therapist. I felt like I was putting all my time and energy into bettering myself.\n\nSo I asked her what she meant, and she said that I needed a therapist and medication  (anti-depressants). She wasn’t aware that I was actively looking for a therapist, it just hadn’t come up. \n\nSo she dismissed all of my physiological health issues and reduced them to me just being depressed, and that I needed to be on antidepressants. This really upset me and we got into a bigger fight and she left to go stay with a friend.\n\nA few days later, her phone lit up and I saw a message from that friend, and it said  “ yeah, it’s hard to help someone who won’t help themselves”. So I looked at the message and it was about me, and I felt really betrayed because it felt like not only what did you not recognize all the effort that I was putting into bettering myself she was perpetuating this idea by telling it to other people, even after I pointed out that I was doing all this stuff to better myself. It just didn’t live up to her idea of what I should be doing to better myself.\n\nFast-forward to a few months ago, and we got into an argument and I had a psychotic break and threatened to kill myself. \nClearly, this really freaked her out, and she was very upset, and I understand all of that, and even though I made no threats towards her, she said, she felt scared and unsafe and wanted me out of the apartment. Like she wanted me to move out. \nConsidering that I am in a city with no friends or family and I don’t have anywhere to go. I told her that I wasn’t moving out of the apartment, and my name is on the lease, etc. \nI eventually did leave for the day. \n\nWhen I was gone, she called her friend, who happens to be her boss, and I later saw a text between them where she told her boss I wouldn’t leave and her boss asked me if she wanted my partner to have her husband come over and drag me out by my hair.\nThey were also calling me bipolar \n\nI am not bipolar. Yes I have felt suicidal, yes, I’ve struggled with depression, yes, I am dealing with anxiety. I’m not bipolar. My psychiatrist doesn’t think I’m bipolar, my therapist doesn’t think I’m bipolar, I don’t exhibit the treats or behaviors of a bipolar person. I do have ups and downs during the day, but I don’t have these prolonged highs or lows that a person with bipolar disorder typically has.\n\nYet they think it’s OK to call me bipolar and you accuse me of being bipolar and won’t listen to me when I say I’m not \n\nAnd I think it’s horrible that her friend suggested for physically removing me from the apartment. Dragging me out by my hair? That’s fucked up.\n\nMy friends would never say or do that about anyone, and I’m having a hard time getting over it and when I think about going to my partner‘s work to bring her lunch or you know, seeing these people in the future, get upset. I don’t want to see these people, I don’t want to be around them.\n\nI don’t know if I’m overreacting or what, or how to get over it or if I should even be in the relationship at all.\n\n**TL;DR** my partner, and her friends have said some things about me that I’m struggling to get over and I’m wondering if I should get over them and how to do that or if I’m overreacting. \nI’ve had some struggles with mental health that I’m working on and during those struggles she told her friends things about me that aren’t true and also her and her friend accuse me of having a mental illness I don’t have, and that friend also asked her if she wanted her husband to physically remove me from the apartment.\nHow can I get over this? Or is there another solution? ",

      "title": "My ‘29F’ friend John ‘28M’ kissed me on vacation. Now we pretend it didn’t happen, but I think I’m in love with him",
      "content": "I moved to a big city 3 years ago, across the country, right after my long-term super toxic relationship ended. I needed out from that situation and to start fresh. The first year in the city was the worst time of my life. I went through some things that are hard to talk about. To keep it lighter, let’s say I was drinking heavily at home alone and not being kind to myself. I couldn’t do the work to heal; to be fair I still haven’t, but I don’t feel pain anymore. I feel satisfaction in my life, finally learning and loving how to be alone.\n\nAbout a year here I said enough is enough and I found an activity to do here where I can be active but also meet people. All the friends I have now I met through that activity. Except for John (fake name)! John was childhood friend with Miles (also fake name) and they had moved together to our big city around the same time I had. Miles became part of the activity where we met, John however was the complete opposite! He was a homebody. Didn’t like to do outside activities other than going out to dinners or bars if he HAD to. He’s the definition of a nerd (in the best way possible) where he spends his free time gaming and doing legos. He’s got a charming and funny personality.\n\nJohn has never had a girlfriend! He never goes out on dates. He’s satisfied with his life and has told me in the past (long before I felt this way for him) that he doesn’t know if he wants to settle down or if he even knows how to. The past few months I catch myself thinking about him, then I force myself to stop because nothing can ever happen. Because I don’t wanna ruin the friendship.\n\nUntil 3 months ago when we took an all-inclusive trip for Miles’s 30th birthday. There was 8 of us. Most of the trip we were drinking and most of the trip I found myself wanting to be with John. I didn’t even know exactly how I felt about him, just knew I wanted to be holding his hands and hug him and hold on to him the whole time. I couldn’t stop myself! So a few nights in, I said I was tired and was going back to the room. John said he was walking me back.\n\nOn the way I couldn’t help myself, so I asked him “Are you really that clueless John?” That’s all he needed and he knew exactly what I was talking about. He came to kiss me so strongly the first time, then again and again. The whole walk back to the room. He asked me what I wanted and, what now??? but that moment I froze and didn’t know what to say so I told him that it’s completely up to him and there’s no pressure, whatever the outcome.\n\nThe truth is I didn’t know what I wanted! At that very moment it hit me that I didn’t wanna feel pressured on starting a relationship with him just because we knew each other so well, or risk losing our friendship altogether. I didn’t know what I wanted and I panicked and couldn’t answer.\n\nThe next 2 days he mentioned (one time a day) asking what I wanted and what would happen, but each time I didn’t say much except for leaving it up to him what he wanted to do. Then the last day he said it’s best nothing happens between us. He said he values me so much and I’m an amazing person, and he doesn’t deserve me. He said some unworthy things about himself, which I immediately turned down. But I didn’t push the fact that he didn’t wanna try something with me.\n\nThe truth is I didn’t even know what I wanted from him. The first time he kissed me, I froze because I knew he had never been with another woman, and I didn’t wanna go all in right away. I froze because I wasn’t sure of what he would want. So that day we left things off as friends, but I can’t stop thinking about him and feeling guilty for not saying a single thing I felt about him, during the entire trip.\n\nIt’s been 3 months since the trip and we’re acting as friends again, but I can’t help but feel guilty for not fully opening up to him and telling him exactly what I feel and want. I still feel the same! Just earlier today I saw some memories in my phone from a year ago where him and I were so close together, if you didn’t know you would think we were a couple. I’m so confused! I can’t seem to let it go but I also don’t know if I should bring it up ",

So it was a slap in the face when I found out. He lied about it and soon within that night he admitted to it after grilling him. Fast forward I didn’t talk to him for a while due me being completely done. During that time, he was once sitting in very apologetic regretful and seemed even more hurt than me during the time. I came up with a solution that in order for me to give him even a thought of a second chance that he would need to do therapy and we could possibly do joined couple sessions. He completely agreed and gave me a bunch of promises that he wanted to take into effect for change. 2 months later none of that has been fulfilled. He has now “changed his mind” about therapy & refuses to do the paperwork. Alongside of other present behaviors such as dismissive, not putting me as priority, faulting me & etc. I feel like he’s now “changing his mind” since he feels he’s back in good graces and everything is semi normal. He was agreeable when he seen crying and hurting and avoiding him but that’s changed. Any advice?",

      "title": "My (31M) wife (30F) is a terrible driver. I am worried she's going to hurt herself. How can I have a conversation about this?",
      "content": "As the title says, my wife is an extremely bad driver. She will get involved in a minor low-speed fender bender maybe once every couple of months, and has been in three accidents I would regard as 'very serious' (the airbags deployed). There's two problems this causes for our relationship which I need help with. The first is financial - she is now basically uninsurable, so I have her as a named driver on my insurance. My premiums are becoming unmanageable now too. If they go up much more, I'll be unable to afford to drive, and I need to drive for work. The second and more important one is moral - I worry constantly that she is going to kill herself, or someone else, or both. I worry especially about crashes which could happen with our child in the car. I understand it is abusive to confiscate her keys, but I'd rather be abusive than have someone's death on my conscience so I am seriously contemplating it. I am writing this waiting to pick her up from hospital after her third 'very serious' accident (she broke a wrist, other driver was fine), and I feel I absolutely must get a commitment to change behaviour from her before she gets back on the road.\n\nWhen we have spoken about this in the past, she does not seem to understand the seriousness of being this bad at driving. She will argue that she hasn't been in an accident for X months so any particular accident we are talking about is just bad luck. Or alternatively, the other driver was at fault so it is again just bad luck for her. After the first serious accident I bought a dashcam, and after the second when she said that it was not her fault I showed her back the footage (she was 100% at fault) and she cried and said she must have just forgotten details in the confusion of the accident. She will argue that she only crashes when she is stressed, so stressing her out by arguing is counterproductive. She has argued in the past that the lines on the reversing camera are not quite aligned with the side of the car (I'm pretty sure this is not true, but it is certainly irrelevant) so she wasn't to blame for a fender bender. In short, I get very frustrated that she doesn't seem willing to take any responsibility for just being a bad driver - she always believes crashes are caused by external forces beyond her control, and that I am victimising her by believing otherwise. \n\nI have suggested a defensive driving course and offered to pay for it, but she says she is too busy. I have asked her if there are any safety features she needs on the car to park better (a lot of the fender-benders happen in car parks) and she says no, she can drive fine with what we've got. Complicating things is that she also needs to drive for work. Any solution which involves her not driving creates huge financial pressure for us, but as I said above I'd rather be poor than have the death of another driver or my wife on my conscience. \n\nEvery conversation we have about this which does not end with me forgiving her fully and encouraging her to do better next time turns into an argument. However as I say, I think I need to accept that we're going to have a massive argument about this, because I'm at the point of confiscating her keys and taking her off my insurance to protect her from herself. Is there any approach I can take to the conversation which is going to help soften the blow that I no longer trust her behind the wheel?",

      "content": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 and 1/2 years now. Our relationship is honestly more than I could ever ask for except for the fact that my boyfriend seems uninterested in sex. \n\nI first noticed he became less interested in sex altogether about 2 and 1/2 years into the relationship. Our relationship started off very intimate and we would have sex every few days or at least once a week. Not to toot my own horn but I'm a pretty attractive young woman with quite a nice body and I've had many men make advances on me in this relationship. My boyfriend is handsome and athletic but he has gained a bit of weight the last couple of years. \n\nNow I genuinely don't care about his weight but since he's shown less interest in any sexual intimacy, I feel like the attraction to him is kind of fading because I can't seem to get any kind of satisfaction from him. \n\nI've tried to initiate various things with him a countless amount of times and in very many different ways, but still he never initiates anything anymore and even when I try, he doesn't seem like he wants it as badly as I do. \n\nI've spoken to him about it on multiple occasions already, he's explained that it's not me, he's not cheating, there's nothing wrong with him and he's no less interested in me than when we first started dating but I can't help but feel the way I do when I know there's hardly an intimate connection there anymore. \n\nI've suggested many different things and I genuinely don't want to be with anyone but him. I want to marry him and have kids with him, but this has been going on in our relationship for a couple years now, and I'm almost starting to consider the absolute last resort of suggesting we spend some time apart or maybe even break up so I can explore a connection with someone who has the same sexual needs as I do. \n\nI'm no sex addict, but I do need a fair amount of sexual intimacy, chemistry and tension - even if it's just once a week - to feel satisfied in a relationship and it's really starting to affect me mentally feeling like he doesn't want me, but whenever I bring it up he always says the same things and tells me it's not me. \n\nWhat is it that could be causing this?

There's plenty that I still like about her, but she's very manipulative. She also has a habit of not respecting my boundaries. I've cut ties with people for such things before, including my dad recently. I have zero tolerance for manipulation. I can't stand being used and devalued. Not anymore at least.\nI see the patterns in our relationship clearly, and I see that she's either incapable of change or unwilling to go through it. She loves saying she's working on herself but not doing any of the actual work.\n\nAnyways, enough venting, you get the picture. Ups and downs, manipulations of various kinds, very intense relationship. I'm not sure how to end it. I mean obviously in person and all that, but, what do I say? I can't tell her im breaking up with her because she's too much like my dad... that'll wreck her. Can't tell her she's manipulative, as I've done that before and given examples, only to be met with obvious denials. I don't want the conversation to be about her faults, but at the same time, I feel that I owe her an explanation of why I'm leaving. I can't just say \"Yeah, this relationship is no good, gimme my stuff back\". I feel like it doesn't work that way. \nWhat do I say? How do I handle the conversation?\n\nTL;DR - GF is manipulative, and I want out. I don't want to be dragged into a discussion about her faults while still letting her know why.",

      "content": "My boyfriend 31M has not had a job in 7 months. I 28F work nights, 48-60 hour weeks. We’ve been together for 4 years. We traveled for work together for 3 years and due to our profession at times we both have gone 3-7 weeks where one of us isn’t working. We stopped traveling and moved back home 7 months ago. I live in a rural area where he would have to commute 45 minutes for his career and most likely stay in hotels 3-4 days a month for work requirements. He has done this before and hated it. His job does not pay well unless he travels. We moved home because I was tired of traveling, he wanted to continue. I agreed to give him time to figure out his next step, as I understand he’s in a difficult situation. My patience has worn thin and every time I bring up work he blows me off, tells me he’ll get one. I finally snapped today and told him he HAS TO GET A JOB. Now he’s not talking to me and said he’ll have a job in 3 weeks out of state. I don’t want him to go out of state and I feel he said this as a jab. I don’t care if he makes a lot of money. It’s not about that. It’s about having drive and motivation. Is it even possible to explain to a man they need a job without making them feel worse. And no, leaving him is not an option. He has stood by my side in many difficult situations. I want to do the same for him. But I’m not going to support him forever and him not working while I’m exhausted is starting to make me resent him. \n\nEDIT:Just to clarify. I always made it very clear to him that he did not have to stop his own career or stop traveling just because I wanted to. He insisted (he hates his job) so it wasn’t a hard decision for him. We have 2 hospitals one 35 minutes away and one 45 minutes away from where we are currently that he would get hired at in a heartbeat. He’s refusing because he doesn’t want to make the commute. I said ok I don’t want you to do something you’d hate. When we came back home we had an understanding that he could have a couple months to figure out what his next steps were and I had no issue with that. Well that’s more than passed at this point. I also am very adamant with him and always have been, that I will support literally anything (go back to school, traveling for work out of state, traveling in state, get any sort of job I don’t care what the pay is, work part time) I just need him to do something. Now we’re at the point where he keeps telling me he’ll figure it out and get a job or go back to school and gets upset when I bring it up. Well he’s been saying that for about 5 months now and I don’t know if I believe he really wants to get a job. That’s what my issue is. He seems happy to just let me work, pay for absolutely everything, take care of absolutely all responsibilities. He drives my car, I pay for every single bill he has as well as mine. I pay for the food, the rent, the water, the internet, the phone bills, anything and everything he needs down to his deodorant. I’m feeling taken advantage of at this point. I just don’t know how to encourage him to want to contribute. ",

Except the fact for the past year she’s lead me to believe she was on some sort of BC.

She’s been actively trying to get pregnant with her friends and mom’s encouragement, and with me thinking she’s been on BC I don’t pull out. So far she hasn’t gotten pregnant yet. But how do I trust anything important that we’ve discussed now? I want a stable financial situation with a home to call our own then I’m all aboard the kids train. But she stresses out already about taking a $500 vacation to Austin. I can’t have adult conversations with her because she shuts down and stops communicating. She also puts in little to no effort around the house. Sunday was the first time in two months she’s done any sort of house work. Otherwise I have to do all the cleaning, cooking, laundry. She hasn’t initiated any intimate activities since I moved in last October. We’re having a small get together for the 4th of July and I asked her to come up with some sides and to let me know what to get, and that was too stressful so now I’m planning everything on my own. I do love this girl but I know long term this won’t work in its current format. So how do I approach this conversation without upsetting a girl who has severe anxiety and depression?",

I don't want to \"choose a boyfriend over my family\", but I seriously feel like my sister is being unreasonable right now.\n\nThe issue happened last night, when my sister (20F) \"JJ\", started talking in front of our kid sisters (12 and 10F). My mom's boyfriend said something we feel was very inappropriate about the 12yo, but JJ confronted my mom and repeated what he said _in front of the kids._ I was like \"wow, that's extremely inappropriate but\"- and gestured to kids behind her. She shrugged me off.\n\nLater, she was telling me about the gay native man that was killed and _all_ the details about the case with the kids sitting next to me. I was like \"I heard about that, it's terrible\" etc. I don't really know how to stop her. Whenever I tell her she's being inappropriate she kinda just shrugs and laughs. She calls the 12yo \"girl\" and \"ho\", and cusses around/at them- even the 8yo (she lives with her dad but visits weekends).\n\nMy boyfriend stopped her though, and basically told it was inappropriate to talk about this in front of kids. She turned to him and said \"Yeah, but these are _my_ siblings so it's not really your business to say anything, no offense though\". He left, and she kept telling me that \"it's fine if he has an opinion but it's not his place to say anything\". All I could think about is how I agreed with him (which I told her) and how they're not _her kids._ She snapped like someone just questioned her parenting. \n\nI shit you not, this girl recently told me she wants to start having kids at 22 because \"I want to have kids in my prime\". She doesn't even like the kids already here but keeps repeating \"My kids will never act like this\". They used to be _very_ bad okay- no good role models, no supervision, no parenting whatsoever etc. However they understand a lot now. They act like normal preteens. They just need a real adult, not 20yo who cusses at them and talks about how bad they are in front of their faces.\n\nShe got back with her ex maybe a month ago, their relationship was extremely toxic but she keeps telling me how he's different, how their going to move in together soon, get jobs and have kids in 2 years. Meanwhile she's been trying to get me to breakup with my boyfriend.\n\nI think she has BPD, but don't know how to be around someone who seems like they're trying to fuck up their life. There's even more than what I wrote here, like how she quit her job and _why_ she quit her job.\n\nAt the same time.... I love my boyfriend, and now 2 of my sisters don't like him and my mom \"doesn't think we're right for each other\" or something. Only the kids still like him.",

      "content": "Using throwaway account \n\nI´ve been dating my girlfriend for 8 months now, we are in a long distance relationship and everything has been amazing. She's smart, beautiful, caring and I love her. Throughout the relationship we´ve had arguments but nothing too crazy and have always managed to resolve them. Despite the long distance, we have managed to make it work, by seeing each other on an almost monthly basis. Now with being LDR, there is always the aspect of people hitting on your girlfriend, but it's not something that really bothers me as I trust her and we always end up having a laugh about it, we even gave these types of situations a name (This is important for later). When it comes to my end, I rarely get hit on, as I am an introverted person and when I go out with my friends I mainly keep to myself or talk with my friends. Also another piece of information to mention is that I am dense when it comes to realising when someone is flirting with me, which is something my girlfriend finds endearing for the most part but which she has also expressed worry about, as I may find myself in a situation of someone flirting with me and not realising. The reason I mention this is to give a bit of background information. \n\n\n\nRecently a friend of mine had a small gathering for his birthday. We were about 7 people hanging out at the outside tables of a bar. Among the group there was this girl who was a university friend of the birthday guy who arrived later and sat next to me, it was my first time meeting her. As the night went by she made comments that were flirtatious, such as mentioning how funny I was on 3 occasions and how good I looked in a jacket twice. At that stage I had started to realise what was up, but due to the setting of the gathering I couldn't really do anything to leave the situation, therefore I looked for ways to bring up that I had a girlfriend, and the opportunity presented itself when my friend mentioned a gathering at my house I had the week prior were my girlfriend was present, with that I was able to bring her into the general conversation. After talking about my girlfriend for a bit, the girl that was hitting on me made a comment about french people (my gf is french) which felt like a dig towards french people. After that there was no more flirting and the gathering kept on going. When it ended, and everyone was going back home she was going the same way as I and had to get the same metro, during the ride we just talked about our fields of work and that was it. \n\n\n\nThe next day, I spoke to my girlfriend on the phone and told her about the situation, and I expected that we'd laugh about the situation as we tend to do, and we did at first, but as we kept on talking about it, it seemed she was getting more annoyed about the situation and believed I should have done more to dissuade her or avoid the situation. It then developed into an argument, as we kept on discussing the matter I felt she was angry at me, and was feeling a bit upset. When I brought this up, she explained that she feels that as I was talking about it she was finding more information about the situation, and felt that I was somewhat concealing it, which was not at all the case. After talking a bit further, we were able to settle the matter and now laugh about it. \n\n\n\nThe reason this situation got me thinking is that when she finds herself in those scenarios my reaction, despite being bothered about it, is calm. Even recently when she went to a party a guy tried to make a move on her and made it clear by his body language that he wanted to kiss her. I was of course annoyed, but I trust her and know that nothing would happen. I guess what I am trying to ask here is some guidance on the situation, me and my gf have discussed the matter, but would like some outside perspective on this matter, is there a deeper issue here? \n\nThank you. ",

      "content": "Hi :) As you can probably guess by the title this post is a bit nsfw so please don’t read if you’re sensitive to that kind of content. Also for obvious reasons I made a throw away account to ask for advice on this. \n\nLet me start by saying that this is my first relationship with a girl, and I realized sort of late in my teen years that I probably liked girls, hence the late start. I dated men in high school and college and was calling myself bisexual, but really I think I was just scared to fully label myself a lesbian. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met almost a year ago and we started out as good friends, which slowly turned into a lot more obviously. She knows that she is my first relationship with a woman and she is very accepting of that which wasn’t always the case. All of that to say that in terms of dating she is more experienced than me, and especially when it comes to sex with other women. \n\nNow here’s where I need advice. So my girlfriend is very much the giver in the sense that she absolutely doesn’t let me do anything for her. She is very masc, short hair, masc clothing, and sometimes won’t even let me touch her chest or take the dang sports bra off. She seems almost uncomfortable with her chest, which leads to me not being allowed to touch her. Also, I guess you can say she takes on a lot more of the “masc” role during sex, except in the way she won’t let me do anything whatsoever for her. Only once or twice in the whole five months we’ve been doing this has she let me do anything for her specifically. Now I’m not complaining because she definitely does make sure I’m satisfied, but it always makes me feel kinda bad or selfish when I try to reciprocate and she shoots me down. \n\nIt it truly almost like she’s uncomfortable with her own self. I’ve tried to ask her that but she’s the type to joke her way out of a serious conversation or just avoid it completely. But honestly, it’s starting to make me feel weird. I hate being the only one getting pleasure, even though 95% of the time, it’s her initiating it in the first place. I’m not sure if any of this made sense but please, if you have advice, let me know.  ",

      "title": "My (24F) BF (27M) booked our tickets for a different day. I’m tired, frustrated and contemplating breaking up with him. What would you do in my place?",
      "content": "Throwaway for obvious reasons. TLDR at the bottom.\n\nI, 24 F, have been dating my boyfriend, 27 M, for 2 years long-distance. We don’t live together, but due to our demanding jobs we try to see each other at least 3x/month. Overall I can say many positive things about our relationship, however things took a turn a few weeks ago and I can’t seem to forgive him.\n\nFor context, I’m very much a Type A person, I need everything planned and to be in order. However, since I’m always planning things (with friends, BF or at work), I get worn down pretty quickly and it takes a toll on my mood. He on the other hand is very laid back and goes through life with an “it is what it is” attitude. So naturally, it has always been me who’s been planning activities, booking places to stay, sightseeing and holiday all throughout our relationship.\n\nA year ago, BF got me tickets for my favourite artist and I’ve been excited ever since. I still had to book transportation, hotel and plan activities though, but I didn’t mind as long as we could get to see the artist in time. Spoiler alert: we missed the concert because BF booked the tickets for a different day and we couldn’t get a refund.\n\nSafe to say, I’ve never been more dissappointed in my life. I still feel physically, emotionally and financially drained, and that I can’t rely on him. I decided we needed to go on a break and I’ve been talking with my friends and my therapist about what to do. My therapist said that I’m processing it as a betrayal and a breach of trust. My friends are telling me it’s up to me if I want to continue the relationship, but if they were in my shoes, they couldn’t trust him with anything ever again.\n\nI understand that it’s a mistake anyone could have made and in the end it’s not that serious. He has apologised about a million times and feels very sorry about how he let me down. But at the same time, all this pent-up frustration that’s inside me keeps reminding me he had one job and still managed to ruin the experience for me.\n\nOf course, not everything is black and white. Besides this character flaw, he is a very good boyfriend, kind, funny, and we have the same opinions on politics, human rights etc . (basically all the serious life stuff). I can’t seem to get over this mistake though. We were planning on getting married and spending the rest of our lives together, yet I don’t want to end up being the only one pulling the weight.\n\nAdvice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nTLDR; I always plan every activity, BF had one job of buying tickets and messed it up. I’m tired and I feel alone, I don’t know what to do.\n\nEdit: there seems to be some confusion regarding booking and tickets - there were two concerts, one was happening on the 31st and second was on the 1st. BF told me we had tickets for the second concert, so I booked everything in accordance to that. Then on the 1st he realised we had tickets for the 31st - so the day after we were supposed to attend the concert. Also, only he had access to the tickets. Hope that clears it up a bit.\n\nEdit 2: so far I’ve seen people form 3 stances in the comments: break up with him or I will have to manage him for the rest of my life, give him a chance with a set of boundaries or I’m actually neurotic and he should break up with me. \n\nI’ve done some introspection and considering all the facts - uneven mental load, distance, how long we’d still be apart, my reaction - I’ve drafted a message explaining how I felt, highlighting how much I still care about him. I’ve also written a few questions to ask him about the future of our relationship. He probably thought a lot about our relationship as well, and if he doesn’t want to be with me, I’m not going to force him. I’ll ask him probably next week, not sure if anyone wants an update on that though. \n\nOverall this situation has saddened me and I feel extremely uncertain about my future. Thank you to all kind redditors who actually offered great advice.",

      "content": "So this just happened and I'm kind of sitting here shaking. My boyfriend and I have been together for a little over 2 years. We have a baby and I have a child in preschool from a previous relationship who knows him as Dad.\n\nTo get right to what happened, my bf had gone to bed early as he starts work early in the morning. I just went up to the room to go to sleep and I see he fell asleep with the light on. His phone is laying on the bed on, as it usually is, on and open. I look and it doesn't look like his regular adult videos and I looked further and see it's Grindr. I didn't look much further into it as I was so shocked. I immediately left and went back downstairs. \n\nI am wondering where do I go from here?\n\nMy mind is racing. We have talked about sleeping with other people as an option but never agreed upon it. He did reveal he was bi but he hadn't done a lot with guys as he prefers girls. \n\nI'm so confused. I have been supporting him by taking care of our children while he is working. He has gone away for school and work this year, just recently he was away during the week and came home on weekends. I am questioning everything and starting to spiral. This feels like it's going to break me. \n\nUpdate:\n\nSo I talked to him and it turns out he cheated on me with a girl when I was 4 months pregnant with our child. I'm done. ",

      "content": "My husband (43M) and I (51F) have historically struggled with keeping up the house and yard. Over the past few months, I’ve made a real effort to improve this. I’ve taken on more cleaning, organizing, and yard work, and I’m starting to feel proud of our home for the first time in a long while.\n\nToday, I asked my husband if he could start helping out more. His response was, *“Well, if I help out more then I’ll have to work less.”* I was surprised and didn’t know how to respond in the moment. Now that I’ve had time to reflect, I realize I’m pretty upset. His comment felt dismissive of the work I’ve been doing and seemed to suggest that domestic responsibilities aren't worth sharing unless they come at the cost of paid work.\n\nHow can I talk to him about how this made me feel without escalating things? I want to be honest and constructive, but I also want him to understand why his comment hurt.\n\n**Edit to add:** I work a 40+ hour week as a paralegal. While I do work from home, I rarely take breaks and often put in overtime. We also run a small home business as resellers. Between sourcing inventory (both in-person and online), listing, and packaging items, I’d estimate my husband works about 25 hours a week, mostly from home. I also help with the business by going out with him to source inventory on most weekends.",

      "content": "Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/I1hG5KfN6G\n\nI got a lot of advice on my last post. Some helpful, some not. A lot of people slammed him for not working more. I want to clear that up. He was working the same amount of hours as I was. Sometimes more. But his hours got cut at work. He’s been looking for a new job or second one, but hasn’t had much luck. I know he has been looking and putting in effort. That’s not an issue. \n\nBut I sat down with him and said that we really need to talk about this, because I had to go to work today (Monday). I sat down and told him I get he is having a hard time with his hours being cut and trying navigate the job market. But I have a good job and I need to get there. And I can’t afford to uber a car while I heal. We need to find a solution. \n\nHe kept talking in circles with the same reasons I mentioned in the last post. I don’t know exactly what I said, but it was something along the lines of “that is not good enough for me. I don’t accept those reasons and I don’t think they’re true. What is the actual reason? We are married and partners, why am I left hanging like this?” \n\nHe finally told me the truth. Since his hours got cut, he hasn’t been maintaining his car. He had savings and maintained his car when he worked more, but when his hours got cut, he started using his savings to pay his part of the bills. And when it ran low, he finally let me readjust our spending. I pushed for it from the start, but he refused. \n\nBut when his savings ran low, his car started having problems and he couldn’t afford to fix it. He needs new tires. He needs new brakes. The AC stopped working. And he also is well overdue for an oil change. He used to keep up with this stuff, but hasn’t because he is low on money. \n\nHe was ashamed and didn’t want me to use his car or ride in it because he didn’t want me to know how bad it was. He was embarrassed so he never brought it up. So he has been driving an unsafe car and didn’t want me to drive it. \n\nAfter a very long talk, we came to a solution. I will buy him used tires. They need to be done, but can wait a week as we look and get this set up. Yesterday we replaced the brake pads and do an oil change. I couldn’t physically help, but I read him steps and look at things when he wasn’t sure. His dad also helped over FaceTime. Between our brains, we figured it out. We decided not to mess with the AC because that’s a comfort thing and not necessary, especially during this time of year. \n\nSo in all, he was having a private struggle I wasn’t aware of. I usually don’t go in his car, so I never noticed. And this morning, he drove me to and from work. And either he will drive me or I will drive myself, with his permission. Depends on the day. \n\nI knew he was struggling with the lack of income and I have been pushing and pushing for him to let me do more. But he held out due to pride. And his car suffered. And honestly, I think I might do the same thing. I still feel a bit betrayed and the trust has eroded a bit. But at the same time, I also feel like I got closer to him. It’s a weird feeling I can’t fully explain. But in the end, I can get to work with his help. ",

      "content": "I feel like I can’t talk to anyone irl about this and I’ve been lurking here for ages, so maybe someone has some good advice here. \nWe‘ve been together for about 6,5 years and got engaged 9 months ago. I thought everything was fine, we decided on a date for the wedding and collected a few venue options, that we were going to view soon. The date would have been in about 10 months. I’ve been trying to convince him to help me pick which venue we should view first, but he always hat different reasons as to why it wasn’t a good time (work stress, long day, …) but said he was looking forward to the wedding. \nI also already bought a dress two months ago - his mother als well as mine came along and helped me choose the perfect one. He seemed to be excited about it. \nA couple weeks ago I asked him about the venues and planning in general. After all, it takes quite a bit of time to plan a wedding. He didn’t really give me a straight answer and I told him that it really seems like he‘s dragging his feet, which he initially denied. He said it just seems so far away still. \nWell, the day before yesterday he told me he wants to postpone the wedding indefinitely. He said he realized he‘s just not ready to get married yet. He was also adamant that he doesn’t want to break off the engagement, he just needs more time. Doesn’t know how long though. \nI‘ll be honest, that really pulled the rug out from under my feet. I was absolutely shocked. I mean sure, he wasn’t really putting that much effort into planning, but it’s kind of been like that for our whole relationship. I’m the planner and he is more of the type of person to do things spontaneously, so it didn’t seem out of the ordinary to me. \nNeedless to say I’m incredibly hurt and don’t know how to process my feelings towards the situation. I feel like I set myself up by getting too excited. I do love him but I feel so hurt and he doesn’t seem to understand why I feel the way I feel. From his point of view, our relationship hasn’t changed. \nI don’t want to break up, because I love the life we’ve built together, so how do I move on from feeling so disappointed in him changing his mind? \nAlso how do I tell friends and family that we aren’t moving forward with the date, without having it seem like something is off in our relationship? I don’t think I can handle the pity some of my girls are inevitably going to show me. ",

      "content": "Me and my boyfriend have been going steady for quite a while now. However life has been life-ing HARD lately for me such as I lost my job, Ive wasn’t accepted into the nursing program I wanted to get into, and many other factors. We had planned a trip to Japan in September and we booked the tickets when I still had a job, and things were good. \n\nLosing my job took a heavy toll on me, because I rely plenty on having a routine. And when I lost that routine, I felt lost, especially when i got the news that I wouldn’t be continuing in my dream nursing program. I felt stuck and like I just got hit with a huge curveball. Me personally, I don’t do well with change and it takes time for me to get my footing back and return to society as a functional human being. \n\nLately for the past month or so I’ve been feeling a disconnect from him and it’s because he’s been having to work overtime hours and pay for my half of the ticket and other stuff for the trip while I find a job. It took a couple months, but I finally landed one and I start next week (yay!) But.. it’s starting to take a toll on him because he hasn’t been able to do the things he wants to do (like go on dates, etc) and buy the things he wants to. I feel so so horrible because I hate that he’s feeling this way and tonight while watching a movie we were.. starting to get freaky but he stopped out of nowhere and all of a sudden became quiet and closed off. A little bit later when we were in the room I asked him if I had done anything wrong, and why did he stop.. He kept giving me really curt answers like “No you don’t do anything” or “No reason” basically not giving me anything. After a few moments of silence I say “Well if it’s nothing I did I’ll just think you don’t find me attractive and that’s why you stopped.” Long story short (i don’t want to share too many personal details) we had a conversation about how my shortcomings are affecting him such as I’m not responsible, i don’t do “much” (as in I just sit around the house all day because..I don’t have a job), and all of these factors are why he hasn’t been feeling sexually attracted to me lately. I’m relieved it’s not primarily because of my physical appearance but now I’m not sure what to do? Of course I’m gonna pay him back for the air fare and the stuff he’s spent for our trip once I get my paycheck, but that might take another few weeks or so. In the meantime, what can I do to alleviate this strain on our relationship?\n\nOh another thing I think would be good to mention is that I have been out of a relationship for about six years. I’m used to being the Single Girl. He had just got out of a relationship early last year. I’m still relearning how to be a good girlfriend as well and make our relationship last, because I truly do want this to work out. \n\nThank you!",

I’m already an overthinker so it really sucks to see that even though I don’t really believe in that stuff. I’ve already talked through all of this with my partner in the past and I really did get over it. \n\nIt’s hard for me to communicate my feelings to my partner not because they don’t reassure me but because I know whatever they say won’t really help me change my mindset and only comfort me in the moment. And we’ve already had soooo many conversations about this and I hate to bring up the past. \n\nCan anyone give me a reality check or give me advice on maybe different ways to think or to cope with negative thoughts? Harsh truth and criticism is welcomed!! \n\n(btw the cheating took place quite a while ago and seeing the people my partner cheated on me with is more recent) ",

      "content": "Been together for 22 years, married for 19 years and can’t believe I’m having a break down over suspicion of wife cheating. We’ve had a great relationship over the years and never had an issue trusting each other but last year she visited her uncle birthday party in another country alone and that’s where it started. I couldn’t make it due to work so she went alone but this time when she got back she was very quiet for a whole week. I kept asking her if everything was okay, if someone did something to her etc and she said no she was just tired. I never really questioned anything other than what she said. Like I said there was no need to.\n\nFast forward a few months later i noticed her behavior changed to a more relaxed/chilled person. She always complained about little things and she just stopped. I brought it up and she said she doesn’t care about that anymore. I also noticed she was making more of an effort to do things she wouldn’t usually do together as a couple. I asked her about it and she said she wants me to be happy. Now I’ve known this woman for almost half my life and I know she would never say anything like that so that really threw me off but I didn’t question anything more than it was and was extremely happy with the direction of our relationship.\n\nFast forward another few months went by here’s where my suspicions began. We were watching a tv show and a scene came up where the actress was cheating on her husband , my wife instantly got up and said she needed to go to bed in the middle on the episode. I asked her if she was okay and she said he has a migraine. I thought nothing of it, paused it but she insisted that I can watch it alone. Not very much like my wife since she usually gets invested. I still paused it and she still refused to watch it again! It felt strange as i couldn’t understand why she wouldn’t want to watch a show that she suggested. Then i made a stupid Joke about her not liking the cheating scene probably because she plans to cheat on me. It was just a stupid joke and we joke around all the time but my wife got fucking emotional . I could almost see the tears in her eyes. she looked extremely sad and replied I would never cheat on you. It was very weird and it hit me that something wasn’t right with the way she said it. She looked guilty like she’s done something horrible and remembered. I then asked did you cheat on me ? She looked very scared got angry and defensive. Again not like my wife at all. Her old self would’ve laughed and had a smart reply.\n\nIt didn’t sit well with me I’ve known this woman for a long time and days after days the idea of her cheated on me builded in my thoughts. It got so bad that I started questioning everything she did and got obsessed with it. This was in January and I had a talk with her. I told her how I felt and she assured me nothing happened and I should trust her. Well that’s the issue I trusted her ,never questioned anything or anywhere she goes but that one night her emotions was all over the place and it really stood out for me to question her. Nevertheless I let it go, fast forward last month (may) her mom is getting married and another party in the same location the last one was so i definitely am going this time but I  mentioned to her that I might not make it again just to see her reaction and her face just lit the fuck up . It broke my heart that was the most happy I’ve seen my wife since she’s been back from the last party. It almost seems like she’s happy to go back alone to reunite with her lover. Man I’m loosing sleep and stressing did my wife cheat on me , is she having an ongoing affair and I’m such an idiot because she’s so smarter than me . .\n\n\nUpdate . I posted an update in the comments",

      "title": "The hug my (F 30) boyfriend (M 30) my boyfriend gave me feels somehow manipulative?",
      "content": "\nF 30, M 30 \nLong term relationship, living together. \nMy boyfriend works in a housing-type/blue collar type job.\nMy boyfriend told me he was going to check a dog out of the shelter he volunteers at just for the weekend. He then just kept the dog, despite my frustration. The dog has been here a couple months. \n\n\nToday my boyfriend said he was getting home late. My plans with a friend were cancelled so I was home early and he texted me “walk [dog] plz”. I did walk the dog (it’s not her fault she’s here even if i don’t like it, not gonna make her hold her pee longer than necessary). Shortly after I get back in, he gets home, the dog jumps on him, I walk up to him to say hello and get a kiss maybe, but he starts playing with the hugging and giving attention to the dog as always. I walk back to put the food away until they’re done, we talk about dinner plans. He sits on the floor with the dog, \nMe: “Hey, i was waiting on my hugs too”\nHim: “Well keep waiting. Don’t come at me because your friend cancelled”\nPlease note all i mentioned about that at this point was “she rescheduled, didn’t say to when” in a text when he asked why i got home early. I figured I’d just talk to him about my disappointment in not seeing my friend once he was home (no biggie but i had been really excited about it this morning, he knew about it a week ago and saw me pack my overnight bag as we were gonna do a sleepover, nails, games, etc.), but i hadn’t even gotten to talk about that yet so was a little confused so i just removed myself with a slightly snide “well I’m glad you’re home” and went to my room. He comes in about a minute later like \n“okay here’s your hug” i go “it’s fine don’t worry about it”, but lean into him anyway from the chair im sitting on because i do want a hug and as he wraps me kinda tight, he goes “well there you go, you get fiberglass all over you” then just leaves the room.\nI’m so confused. \nWhy wouldn’t he just have said earlier “oh I’m covered in fiberglass give me a minute” or just given me a kiss or anything. Why does it feel like he had to give me what i wanted under a veil of also being intentionally hurtful? (Or even pretending to be if he wasn’t actually covered in fiberglass, i can’t tell, my cheek and shoulder where he hugged me was itchy after but it might just be because he said it.) \nI’ve mentioned previous to today that I’d like some level of affection when we see each other after work. I’ve asked before why he seems to be able to do so with the dog and he says bc she runs up to him. I often unlock the door for him when he pulls up, but I’ve started coming to the door and waiting for him to be done playing with the dog to try to initiate so today i thought i was kind of being a little playful, but maybe too forward about it maybe? \n\nI’m just confused and a little sad for some reason and maybe “manipulative” is the wrong word and maybe it was just kinda mean, but would like some outside perspective and maybe advice on what to say if anything? As my default is to “oh no everything is fine!” and move on if i feel like I’ve already kind of tried something then gotten a negative response from it but don’t want my boyfriend to say I’m being too sensitive.\n\nThanks!",

I was shopping with my mother this past weekend and she asked me if I had enough room in my purse for her water bottle and I literally thought about my pussy. that was the final straw for me\n\ni havent told him yet that it bothers me, and I plan to but I have also been reading on this sub for yrs now that many people's fetishes are so ingrained into their sexuality that there's no way to make them stop. (i know many men cant have sex with women for example unless theyre wearing long thigh-high stockings). i can tell that he's very into it when he says it he almost instantly becomes aroused. i dont know what the mental connection is for him to this term he's never told me, i dont think he knows himself tbh. i also feel partially to blame for originally saying it was fine until it wasnt. \n\nis this something that can be worked through? we have an otherwise VERY healthy relationship we never fight, communicate well, share the same interests and enjoy time together and apart i would consider it a relationship i would like to maintain but i cant hear this day in and day out anymore it is now turning me off.\n\nthoughts? has anyone else dealt with this (i dont mean the purse thing specifically) but an otherwise fairly minor fetish that became annoying over time?",

To be honest i’d really like it if we are just like this but i’d be fine if we mature and chill out too maybe (really enjoy the sex though would miss it lots)\n\n+ don’t have peers i can really ask this because im closed off about this stuff \n\nTLDR: me (18F) and my boyfriend (21M) went from long distance to seeing each other regularly and now we’ve been having sex almost every day. i love it and it feels good but i’m wondering if it’s something we’ll naturally settle down from or if it’s just a “us” thing.\n",

It was just a cycle of him leaving and coming back after he got comfortable again and i started showing i was “done”. The most recent time he came back (january) I wasn’t the nicest nor was the person he met, he was trying to be so sweet and loving until he saw i just couldn’t. I wanted to try but I just couldn’t because of our past( we were very toxic and he got abusive, then cheated) Every time he leaves and is gone for a while, I get thoughts like, “I miss him a lot and i would try if he came back”, “i miss our little routines” just a lot of i miss him or i would try. Deep down i know i wouldn’t be able to but it’s something that my brain won’t let go no matter how hard i try. I don’t want a relationship so I don’t know why i miss certain things about him or just him as a whole. Is it okay to miss your ex after being broken up for so long?

Sex at first was nice and steady. I definitely wanted to more than he did and he voiced that to me at the beginning of our relationship and I slowed down on how much I wanted to. The only thing is if I didn’t try to, we literally wouldn’t have sex. Not even foreplay at least for me, but he would be all for me to him? But sometimes he wouldn’t even want that. I would get different outfits, plan dates, be sexy/spontaneous. Nothing. After we had our daughter it just got worse. I’ll be trying and trying and nothing. I get shot down 99.99% of the time. Being postpartum and a ftm, it feels like a punch to the gut. I bring it up to him all the time. The foreplay, the sex, the lack of intimacy between us. I mean he doesn’t even try to touch me, maybe the occasional ass tap or boob grab, but never anything like that. The 3 years we have been together he’s only went down on me once. Even during sex, which last about 5-10 minutes, it’s like weird. Like he’s not really trying to please me? I’ve asked him, we have talked about and he’s never given me a real reason as to why he likes that. It just boils down to him not being in the mood? But if I show him porn, he perks right up. Sometimes after he will want to, but most of the time he doesn’t. I’m sorry this is like a vent post, there’s so much more to it, I’m just tired of it feeling like it’s my fault. ",

We live in a small town, so everyone kind of knows everyone and word spreads fast, which makes this even more embarrassing and confusing.\n\nLately, my husband has been reaching out to old female coworkers,women he hasn’t talked to in years. Some of them, he even said used to think he was a dork that he never had a girlfriend. Now suddenly he wants to show them pictures of the babies, update them on his life, and see how they’re doing. Suddenly he cares about their life, and it’s super important for him to show them pictures of our twins. \n\nWhat hurts most is that he didn’t just get messages out of nowhere. He’s the one who initiated contact. These people didn’t reach out to congratulate him or check in. He actively went looking for them.\n\nIt makes me feel like the life we’re building now, me, him, our twins, isn’t enough for him emotionally. That he still needs outside validation from people who haven’t been in his life in over a decade. I told him I feel like he’s using our twins to make emotional connections with other women instead of putting that energy into our family. He says his intentions are pure and that I’m being jealous, but that doesn’t make it feel any less painful.\n\nI love him deeply. I value him and everything we’ve built. That’s why this cuts so deep. It’s not about being controlling or jealous. It’s about feeling pushed aside and wondering why the love and support I give him every day isn’t enough.\n\nHow do I even bring this up again without it turning into another fight? I want to understand his side, but I also want him to understand mine. Any advice is welcome.\n\nMaybe I’m just exhausted with my newborns, but I don’t have time to reach out to old connections, why does he? ",

We've dealt with a lot of trauma that has brewed in our relationship over time and as soon as I think things get better we have an argument and they get worse.\n\nToday my husband packed my stuff up in trash bags and said he was done with me and wanted me and our 2 month daughter out of the house. He got angry bc I told him he has yet to change and he told me I was the reason why he can't be a better person. His reasoning was bc I just remind him of how horrible he is.\nThe truth is, when my husband gets angry he IS a horrible person. Today he got angry and was blocking my way out of the room just to trap me in to tell me how much he didn't want to see me again and he was done with me. He then grabbed all my stuff and started to pack them in trash bags. Our daughter starts crying as he's tossing my stuff in the living room, he then grabs the car keys and slams them on my chest as he pushes me and tells me to leave. I tell him he hurt me and I start to cry. I start feeding our daughter as he continues to put my stuff in trash bags and tells me I'll be hearing from his lawyers.\n\nI stay to feed the baby and ask his brother to leave so I can speak to him. I ask him to come sit next to me and ask him if he really wants to divorce me.. his answer was yes. His said he wanted to divorce me bc he didn't want this argument to be used as another example of how horrible he is. I reassure him that I don't think he's horrible I just think he has an unresolved anger issue that is hurting me. I keep reassuring him and he apologizes and says he actually doesn't want a divorce.\n\nHe did the same thing on Mother's Day. As he was telling me he didn't love me and wanted me to leave I held him and told him I loved him and I was here for him.. it took my parents coming over for him to feel sorry.\n\nI'm COMPLETELY heartbroken right now. I feel so unwanted. The truth is I don't trust that my husband will change, I'm scared that he will threaten me with the divorce again. I feel so insecure and defeated in this marriage but I don't want to give up bc I love my husband.",

      "content": "Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/s/GveTGbcATC\n\nSo yesterday I got the nerve to confront him about what has been going on in my head.\n\nI said that I feel like we've been getting distant from each other, and that we're not the same as we used to be. He started to shut down and I told him that we need to talk about things like this. He did apologize for the comments about Pride, and he said it was uncalled for for him to say those things. But i wanted to address other things as well.\n\nI said I felt like I'm the one pushing all of the major decision making. Moving in together, getting his health stuff taken care of, and him getting his own car. I said that i just felt like i was shouldering the relationship and that I'm just so tired of being the one making every big decision. I'm a planner. I need to know what's going on. And he hasn't given me any semblance of him having a plan for himself or our future.\n\nHe got upset. He started saying that he's just a burden, that he fucked up. I told him I never thought or said anything like that but that I'm just trying to one, stand up for myself and my part in this relationship, and two, properly address issues that we can work on. He got more upset, and he said that I am the person that keeps him together and that he wouldnt be here if not for me.\n\nBut what about me? Ive been fighting and fighting and pushing for what. I feel like I'm trying to stop a boulder from rolling downhill. And now that he dropped that on me, I feel even more stuck. He said he'd work on things but even this morning it felt like nothing stuck from the conversation. \n\nI don't want to break him but I'm breaking myself in trying to keep this relationship going. And I'm just so tired. I need any advice. I really don't know where to go from here.",

      "content": "My partner and I were together for nearly 4 years, we’ve been dating since we were 17, both went to university in different places and saw each other on the weekend for years. After we graduated, I moved to a new city, and he stayed living at home with his parents about an hour away, but was working on the outskirts of ny city. When I moved, I had a really hard time adjusting, and struggled a lot with my mental health. I felt totally upended, in a new job that was quite isolating, in a new city, living in a house with 4 strangers in a tiny little box room. I was going to his house every weekend, like we had done in college, but I started to feel really lost, I felt like I was kind of wandering around during the week, trying and failing to make friends and just not enjoying myself, and then at the weekend I was going to his house, and hanging out with his friends. \n\nHis job is also super demanding, he works really long hours and the drive takes it out of him. He did try staying in my house in the city before, but it never really worked because the space was too small and there were too many people for it to really be comfortable. Because of that, at the weekend when I would desperately be needing to do something to enjoy myself, he would always turn me down because he was tired, and preferred to stay in and hang out in his own space. As this happened, I felt like I was loosing sight of myself and what I was interested in, I also had a few pretty big life decisions to make about where to continue my education at the time, and I think the depression was just making it impossible for me to decide anything, so I was always oscillating between things. \n\nAbout 6 weeks ago now, I had a friends come over to visit me for college, and talking to her I was like a burst dam, I told her how confused I was, and how much I love my partner but I was feeling like I was totally lost. I was seeing a therapist at the time as well because I had started having panicked attacks, and I was just so overwhelmed and miserable with what my life was looking like. I basically poured my heart out to my friend, and I told her that I was feeling like my partner was holding me back because he wouldn’t do things with me, and that I was feeling under appreciated and overlooked all the time, like he was always putting himself first. I just felt like I was drowning under so much, and my fears about our relationship were bubbling to the surface. We had also been together a long time for such young people, and everything just got so serious whenever we started working it was like ‘ oh my god, this is my life now, that’s it’. I had this vision of just waking up one day and being married with kids, and having just totally given in to everything he wanted and having nothing of my own, no personality or anything. It’s also worth noting that there are a lot of amazing things about my ex partner, but he is a total workaholic, and he gives everything to his trade. He’s also not the most outgoing or adventurous guy, when I would like to think that I am.\n\nAnyway, after my friend went away, I was with him, and I just had this intense guilt that I had said all those 5ings about our relationship and I just could not keep it in. U stated crying one morning, and when he asked me why I said that I couldn’t see how our relationship was going to work, we were so different and I felt like  had just totally lost myself and I didn’t think I could get out of it while still being with him. It was a really emotional and loving breakup, he was so supportive of me looking after myself, we both said that we loved each other so much and that we hoped that this wasn’t the end of the road for us long term, that hopefully in the future in a few years when we’re grown and have down our things we’ll come back to each other kind of thing.\n\nNow it’s been just over six weeks since the breakup. Directly after, I had a pretty major brekadown. Then I kind of decided that if I had fucked up the best part of my life ( yes there were issues but the love was really intense ) to pursue myself then I really was going to have to grt my shit together. I went back to my therapist, handed in my notice at the shitty job, decided that I am going to move back to my hometown for a while to straighten myself out a bit, have gotten a part time job in something that really excites me, and have accepted an offer to go back to study my masters at the uni that I did my undergrad in. I basically did like a life U turn, in a totally different direction to what I had expected but it feel like it is totally right for me right now. Now that I am on the mend with myself, I keep thinking about our relationship. I miss him so much, and I still have the most insane amount of love for this man, like the thought of either of us being with anyone else makes me feel physically unwell. I know that we wodul have some stuff to work through, and I do think that we couldn’t go back to being the same as we were before, but I miss him so much. My friends and family I think are  all a little worried about me, they don’t think I should go back to him right now because of my mental state, and they think that I should let things settle down a bit and then see how I feel, but I’m terrified that if I do that he might move on without me and I’ll miss my opportunity. \n\nI also have kind of filled up my calendar now for the next while trying to fill the time to stop thinking about him and also doing the stuff that I felt like I wasn’t doing in the relationship. I have a solo trip coming up in at the end of July, and I feel like that would be a good opportunity to like get out of my shell, so I don’t know if I should wait until after this?\n\nI don’t know what to do, I don’t regret breaking up with him because I think I needed that to pull me out of the spiral I was in, but I also know that i have broken his trust and our bond, and that will take a lot to come back from. I don’t want him to think that I don’t take us seriously, I really do. I also am aware that if I try to get him back after this, it feels like I am making the decision that this is it, game over, life partner, and what if the issues actually cant be solved? This breakup has broken me emotionally, and I don’t think I could handle that. Please help ! \n\nTLDR : I broke up with my boyfriend of four years because I felt lost and confused both in the relationship and in my life, and now I feel like I have gained some direction I want him back but don’t know how.\n\n",

I'm 33 with no kids either, and I already feel like an outcast for that.\n\nDo I just lie and say I casually dated throughout my 20s?\n\nI feel like if I got over my depression, I would be sent right back to it once I try to date and realize that I have no common ground with anyone?\n\nAm I thinking too much into it?

      "title": "I [24M] got stood up by the girl [21F] I've been dating for over a month; I tried to call and she wouldn't talk, I texted a little too much.. how do I salvage this?",
      "content": "Edit: just as a disclaimer I've only called once and it was important (she didn't pick up) and I only double texted twice, also for important reasons. I've never texted her like this. I'm not a huge fan of immediate contact for reference, I don't like texting.\n\nSo the first date was like 7 hours and we were all over each other and did everything you can with clothes one. Second and third were the same and fourth we both really wanted to, from the jump she's been whispering \"I want you so bad\" and she fell asleep in my arms on our second date. She's very sweet and holds my head in her lap kissing my forehead and saying how much she likes making me smile, grabbing my face to kiss me passionately after getting flowers (this was last date), etc. but wants to \"keep it casual\" for a while and \"doesn't like labels.\"\n\nOkay, I'm cool with that, but I'm still a person with feelings and finite time on this planet. She is avoidant and it hurts. She doesn't text back sometimes for days which is fine (but when it's something important it sucks), we've never talked on the phone, she cancels a lot and she is at least 45 minutes late to every date. Last one (Friday) was almost two hours. She's canceled I think more than we've actually went out.\n\nWe went to a two day event and I paid for her 2 day ticket, she said she wanted to go the next night with me. And then said she'd see if her mom would go with her, that's obviously okay. She said she'd let me know that night or the next day (day of event). She texted back at 4 PM the next day (day after concert). I asked her if she was good at 10, an hour after the concert started, and her response at 4 the next day was \"ya I'm fine lol\". \n\nI told her to call me or let me know when I could. At 5 yesterday I called, no pick up. I texted her that I missed out going with my brother and cousin because I was waiting on her and am used to her doing things late/last minute. I said we don't see each other twice a week in class anymore so we have disrupted communication, but I didn't understand why she couldn't text me yes or no in an entire day when she said she would. I told her I want to know how much time/space she needs so I don't suffocate her, and what she wants.\n\nJust basic communication, nothing serious, nothing crazy. Finally she responded though, weird.\n\nShe responded \"my mom didn't give me a straight answer so I never even fucking ended up going.\"\n\nI told her I understand and that's why I asked if she was okay, and I'm sorry if that day was rough. I sent 5 texts within an hour and one call, four of the texts being in sets of two. Basically what if amounted was I'd rather have this conversation on the phone, I'm not mad at you I just want to talk about boundaries, I won't raise my voice or anything if that's why she doesn't like phone calls (we're both victims of DV and IPV), and I'm sorry if she's dealing with something personal but I just want communication.\n\nYes I feel like shit about it, but I am kind of at my limit. I smoked a cigarette that night (I don't *ever* smoke) at the bar by myself and just left. Everyone was there and it could have been a good time. But I just felt like shit, like I'm not even worth a 15 second text. I've been extremely patient with her but I'm becoming frustrated at this point.\n\nI don't think she takes into consideration that by me waiting on her she not only fucked up my whole night but hurt my feelings too.",

      "content": "Hi Reddit. It's been a while and I honestly forgot about this site entirely. I dont use any social media or anything so I'm not really in the habit of keeping up with these things. But Reddit sent an email about a privacy update and reminded me about it so I thought I would share an update in case anyone still cares.\n\nThe past 4 years have been a lot of growth for me. I did change my name as some suggested. I didn't end up taking my brother's name out of fear of linking me to my former family and making it easier for them to find me. I did want a connection though so I took the (fairly common) last name of his favorite singer as my last name and a first name I've always loved and wanted to name a daughter someday.\n\nMy room mate was amazing, she got married last year and moved out with her now husband. I still see them occasionally as friends. She let me keep the apartment and I also ended up with her kitty because he liked me better and her husband is mildly allergic. So we're besties now, facing the world together. \n\nI ended up leaving the job that kind redditor helped set me up with after 2 years. I found a much better role closer to the apartment. It pays better and I can walk to work. I'd call it a win.\n\nI know everyone is wondering if there has been more family drama but luckily there hasn't really. I haven't heard from any of them since I left. I am waiting for it though and trying my best to make sure it can't ever happen.\n\nI do wish I had something left of my brother's. He'd be 20 now, the same age I was when all of this went down. It still hurts to know he won't ever be 20, or 30, or anything else. I wish I had kept a piece of him or maybe had some of his ashes made into a necklace or something just to have him with me. Everything happened so fast and I never thought I'd end up leaving home so I always thought I'd just be able to go visit our beach if I wanted to talk to him at all. But I guess that's the trade off.\n\nI don't date at all. I really keep pretty much to myself at least for now. I don't think I can trust people enough to get close. I am in therapy and it's helping.\n\nThings are honestly pretty good right now. I just wanted everyone who wondered to know that. So many kind people offered support and advice and opened my eyes to realities I wasn't ready to recognize. I might not be here if not for them, especially the person who put me in touch with resources and helped me find a new job. I owe my new life to them, so thank you.",

      "title": "My wife 33/F has cheated on me 37/M with another woman… what next?",
      "content": "My wife told me two days ago that she thinks she might be a lesbian and that she’s been having an affair with a woman. We’ve been married almost 6 years, together 8 and a bit years and have a 4 year old.\n\nShe had said previously she’d been feeling trapped and this had been apparent with her behaviour, getting very tetchy with me and sometimes our son (not to a great extent, but kids can be sensitive). I had therefore actively encouraged her to spend more time with friends, which has led to them building an emotional connection, to the extent where they have both told each other they love each other and been talking about how their lives could look like if they were together. \n\nI am devastated. Broken. Lost. \n\nWe’ve not been in a great place for years, both neglecting communication and spending quality time as a couple. Nonetheless, the love has always been there. Or so I thought, I guess. And she still tells me she loves me. \n\nWe’re due to go on a holiday in a week and I, maybe foolishly said for my wife to cut ties with her for 3 weeks, let’s get some help on how to communicate and come on holiday as a family, as a last chance to see if we have something worth saving. This wasn’t dismissed straight away (she wants to come on holiday), and I feel so sorry for my wife as I can see how confused she is, but later she said she couldn’t stand the thought of not talking to the other woman for 3 weeks. She wants to spend time with her before the holiday and despite saying nothing has been physical yet, she wants to get intimate with her, saying she wants to, but it doesn’t necessarily mean she will.\n\nOur son, who does have some special needs (not extreme) has been the centre of our universes and he’s such a strong young man, but has a super strong connection with both of us and I’m terrified what this could do to him. My wife says she knows the right thing to do is to stay but keeps coming back to saying if she doesn’t explore things further, it will always be on her mind, and I do also have concerns that staying together could just be temporary as she’ll do something again in the future if she hasn’t ruled it out now. She says she knows what is right, but wants to explore. The further problem is she’s been thinking about being intimate and likes the thought of it. We’ve had poor intimacy in our relationship for some time. \n\nThis is so out of character for her. She was cheated on before we got together and telling me about it, and from what her friends said to me when we got together, I just can’t comprehend how she can do this to me and our son.\n\nI’ve been an emotional wreck and been from one extreme to another over the past couple of days, as I’m guessing is normal! I’m incredibly impatient with this as my life and the relationship my son ultimately has with both his parents is up in the air, and it’s eating me inside. She says she needs some space, but does space mean going to the other woman which is ultimately going to be an exciting experience, whereas at home it’s not great right now, as you’d expect. \n\nI know from reading other posts that there will be a wide variety of opinions on what I could do, but given my wife was my best friend and I don’t really have much of a support network, or at least nobody else that I’ve ever really opened up to, I need help. So many people will say just get rid and move on, and I probably think similar if I read another post like this, but I have hope that our relationship could be salvaged if we actually worked on it rather than just being on autopilot like we have been for such a long time. I acknowledge the part I’ve paid in not being as attentive to my wife’s needs over the past years, as we have both been very guilty of neglecting trying to make things better, with what little time we spend alone together ends up being on our phones. \n\nI don’t know if I should keep fighting to see if we have something worth saving. There is still an underlying love even though it’s hard to accept what she’s done.\n\nI don’t know if I should give her space to explore her feelings and see if maybe, she misses me. \n\nI don’t know if I should just say we’re done. \n\nI don’t want her to not be a part of our son’s life and I’ve told her that. She tears up every time she talks about not being around for him every day, but the reality is he loves where we live, it’s close to his school that he starts in September and who are actively making adjustments for his needs, so this would remain his home with me until she’s on her feet at which point he could then spend some more time at her place. She’s currently in the spare room for the last two nights. \n\nWhen we talk, it feels like she’s made her mind up that she wants to explore, but won’t tell me she doesn’t want to be with me. I don’t want to be a mug, but where I’m at now, I want to rebuild: partly for me but a big part for our son. Am I being an idiot? Helpful suggestions welcomed…",

He uses the “they die quickly” excuse and then proceeds to tell me how much he does for me when I genuinely don’t feel that that’s true. He doesn’t offer to pay for my meal ever, never surprises me with a gift. I seriously do not want anything expensive, I just want those simple gestures from him. He says it’s materialistic even when I explain to him that it’s not. On my first birthday together we were on abroad on a holiday and he didn’t get me anything because “we were together so I couldn’t get you a gift” and at the time I was really scared to complain or get into a conflict so didn’t say anything. On my last birthday he took me to a store and told me to choose what I want as long as it’s not expensive. I appreciated those little gifts but it just seemed like he couldn’t be bothered. I feel dumb that I’m only seeing this now but this is my first proper relationship and maybe that has something to do with that. I spend a lot of money on his gifts and maybe he doesn’t appreciate it as much because our love languages are different so I stopped spending so much because I feel like I don’t get the same. He says his love language is physical touch and quality time which I have no problem with but I really feel like my needs are not being fulfilled. I am making this post because I would like some clarity and see what you guys think. Why is he like this? Does he not care?\n\nI’m sorry if this was written weirdly, English is not my first language 😅",

      "content": "My bf works full time, while I’m a student with a part time, remote job. \n\nWe do the same thing every week. We send each other pictures of our lunch sometimes. We send IG reels and sometimes reply to each other’s reels. I feel like we don’t really have substantial text conversations or anything on a day-to-day basis, and even though I try to initiate, the conversation stops dead pretty quickly. Every week I go to his house on Friday so we can have sex and I’ll sleep over. And then on Saturday we have lunch. Sometimes when I’m lucky, we’ll see a movie, either on Saturday or Sunday. We never, ever, ever, see each other on Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays. \n\nSometimes, I miss him so I pretend that I have to work at the school library on Wednesdays, which is really conveniently close to his work place and I’ll try to meet up with him for lunch. I work a remote job; I don’t have to usually go anywhere to work. But I do it so I have an excuse to see him. \n\nHe on the other hand, never tells me his misses me, or that he wants to see me. I think partially it’s because we’ve settled on such a routine; he doesn’t feel the need to arrange dates or put in effort or travel to me or take me out because he knows I’ll travel to see him at the end of the week. I don’t feel like he particularly wants to see me or miss me when I’m not around. I think he just expects me. \n\nI always feel like we’re friends who fuck and kiss basically. He doesn’t compliment me that often, or show much interest in what I’m doing when he’s not around. I don’t know how to talk to him about this. I tried to tell him a while ago that I feel unwanted when I tell him I love him and he doesn’t say it back sometimes, or that he goes to sleep before saying goodnight or telling me. He changed accordingly, but now he just says once “goodnight” and “I love you” every night like clockwork. Never in the day or in the afternoon, or in person. Never spontaneously. I don’t feel like I can even be sad about this because he technically does what I tell him to. But it’s so robotic, it’s like he’s ticking off a checklist and not actually giving any extra effort beyond the bare minimum. \n\nIt’s like that with many things in our relationship I feel. I’ve told him since the beginning that I really wanted flowers, and for Valentines he picked me up from my apartment and got me a single rose, prepackaged in a plastic box and stabbed into floral foam from the supermarket beneath where I live. On my birthday, I told him I wanted a card instead of a gift because I wanted him to write something sincerely to me. When he got to my apartment that day, he lied to me and said that he had written it already, but I know he wrote it in my bathroom. I heard him doing it and the card was kind of crinkled with really scrawled handwriting. When I jokingly asked him about it that night, he got a bit defensive and said that I should have known that he got home really late from work both days before my birthday and so he didn’t have time. That really kind of hurt because I wrote his card a week in advance and even rewrote it because I didn’t like my handwriting the first time. I didn’t really say anything both times because I didn’t want to have a sad day. It’s always like this, just the bare minimum of what I tell him, so it makes me feel like I can’t get mad or be sad.\n\nI don’t know how to talk to him about this, please help?",

      "content": "Hello everyone,\n\nFor context, both of us are asians, and is currently on LDR (just a few states away). Yesterday, we got into **two** arguments, and I’m frustrated on how get us to move on.\n\n**1st** was about her being upset because she claimed that I ignored her. My fault that i admit because I intended to take quick nap after i finish my online classes (9am till 4pm). Ended up sleeping longer than planned..  Called her as soon as I woke up and apologized to her. She responded by sulking.  \nI know should have told her that I was tired before I took a nap.\n\nA moment later, I called her again and managed to console her. Talked to her and I told her about how my day was and whatever that is going on. The 2nd argument started right at this point where she questioned me about the 'girl' that I mention while I explaining about my day. She asked me why would that girl texted me. I told her \"Idk, she just joined the class last week (2 weeks late) and she didn't know which group she belongs to\". Told her that I replied to that girl that she can ask the lecturer herself in the chat group.\n\nThen she asked me why I’m only telling her now and not on the day it happened. I told her the truth that I forgot and got caught up with others urgent things (classwork, part-time stuff, etc...). I even had to sort things out so that our plan to date on last weekend would workout. (she's coming to my town. I had to borrowed a car from a relative, wasn't easy).\n\nShe went quiet so I asked her if I did wrong since I'm not lying or cheating on her and I'm telling her the truth. I don't felt like I did wrong. She lashed out her anger on me and sarcastically repeat what I said and started calling me names and wanted to breakup.\n\nShe brought up I once promised her before that I would tell her right away if any girl texted me and I broke that promise. I tried to calmed her down and explained to her that I forgot and just remembered about it today while talking to her, she then hung up while I was still talking.\n\nI’m trying my best in this relationship but seeing how one small mistake turning into big mistake really exhaust me.\n\n**TL;DR -**   \nhad two arguments yesterday.  \n1st: I accidentally took a long nap after class, forgot to tell her, and she got upset for feeling ignored. I admitted my fault and apologized.  \n2nd: While talking later, I mentioned a girl who texted me last week (class-related, nothing suspicious). She got angry that I didn’t tell her earlier, saying I broke a promise to inform her right away if any girl texted me. I genuinely forgot and only remembered while we were talking. tried to explaining, but she lashed out, called me names, brought up breaking up, then hung up on me. Feeling exhausted seeing how one small mistake turning into big mistake.",

      "content": "I'll try and make the context quick, but my boyfriend and I went long distance at the beginning of the year. This has been a challenge for both of us as I'm struggling with finding friends and not having him around. We've talked about it a decent amount and I honestly thought we were in a great spot emotionally. But in the last few months I've been pestering him about talking to me. I knew in my gut that something was wrong and constantly asked him to open up. I got very basic answers to all of these attempts and eventually dropped it. \n\nRecently though, I've found out that people who were working under him were MUCH closer than he previously let on. Like have a group chat, go to dinners once or twice a week, hang out more than we've been able to hang out. At first when I got upset with him about it he told me that he wasn't really sure when they got that close and that it was just gradual. I continued to have conversations with him about it because I could tell he wasn't telling me the entire truth. After multiple hour long discussions about the entire thing he finally admitted to hiding how close they were BECAUSE of me. He said that he wasn't scared I wouldn't approve of the friendships between them because of the fact that the majority of them are 18 year old girls. He also said that because I would have asked him to set boundaries between them that he didn't tell me the extent of their relationship. He said that he's been having fun and basically that he didn't want to tell me because he didn't want to stop having fun. \n\nI'm so upset with him at this point. I've been begging him to communicate with me for the past few months and then this comes out. I just feel so betrayed that he would cut me off from this portion of his life. I understand having a separate friend group. He went out of his way to hide them because he knew how I'd feel. Once I went off on him he immediately apologized. He's obviously remorseful about this. He's been apologizing over and over. He's distanced himself from them as well. I just can't let go of this and it's eating at me. It's opened wounds that were previously closed and I just don't know how to deal with it. ",

      "content": "Throwaway account due to family lurking on Reddit.\n\nI basicaly had to retire early due to a chronical disease that i've been battling for over a decade now. As the title says, i'm getting mixed signals from my wife about how i handle my disease.\n\nIn short, due to this disease i have limited energy and issues with memory, concentration and social + cognitive abilities. I can completely function on my own, i don't need a caregiver or even medication. My wife however keeps oversight of all important matters of our household, due to my memory loss. I'm working on that, using tasks and alarms on my phone and i've managed keeping oversight on two complex renovations to the house so i'm not completely useless in that department. On my wife's workdays i run the entire household, including each and every chore. On her days off we do 50/50. My wife works 3 days.\n\nIt's important to note that i'm about two to three times as active as medically is considered sustainable. For me it's either feeling \"exhausted but happy\" with what i did or \"less exhausted but frustrated\". Also important is that as long as i manage my health carefully, i'm able to do a lot of fun stuff together, ranging from dinners to concerts and weekend trips (at the very least monthly).\n\nI'm not sure if my wife truly understands the impact this disease has. Given how long we're dealing with it, it hardly is talked about anymore. She doesn't join me in meetings with specialists and therapists (i ask her to join me but she's always to busy). Basically she makes it rather clear she doesn't want to talk about it.\n\nThe issue is as follows. I'd say about 90% of the time she tells me that i don't do enough, quantity and quality wise. Like \"why didn't you do x too\" or \"it's nice that dinner is ready but what about the garden\". The other 10% of the time she tells me to manage my health, enjoy what's basically an early retirement and built a life that satisfies me outside the household chores. She tells me that managing my health and my life is a \"me issue\" and that she'll just see what i can deliver chore wise.\n\nI'm confused and i don't get a clear answer on why there's this huge gap between her constantly showing not being satisfied with what i do and on the other hand her telling me to relax and only do what i want and can do.\n\nAny insight? Do i miss something?",

      "content": "My partner and I met in 2017, but we were in different schools then, and I lived about 3 hours away from her city. After graduating in 2018, I got a job in a small city 3 hrs away from her city, and I like it there.\n\nIn 2019, she moved in with me because things were tough for her, and she didn’t have a job. We frequently drove to the city (every two weeks in summer till date) because her family and mine stayed there, and she started a small business there too. \n\nIn 2020, I sat her down and told her I wanted to stay in this area till retirement because my job offered good job security, benefits, and a pension plan (one of the best in the country). Also there is a high chance of progressing through the company (which I have now). I said I wanted to take this path, and she had to decide if she was okay with living in the small city or if we should go our separate ways. That way, she could live in the big city with better job opportunities. \n\nSince long-distance relationships wasn’t an option for her, I didn’t want her to regret living here knowing her friends and family were there, and I was making the best decision for myself. I recommended we go our separate ways. She said she was okay with the area and we would make things work.\n\nIn 2021, we bought our first house, and she got a remote job. I proposed in 2022, and we got married last year. However, she nags out loud every few months that she’s tired of the area and that I’m the reason she’s here, more frequently lately. Especially when something irritates her, even though it’s no fault of mine. I keep quiet to avoid a fight. She got laid off towards the end of last year and has been looking for a job since then.\n\nThis week, we had this talk, and she said I should try and get another job in the big city, that this place is not working for her anymore. I have told her to apply for jobs in our area. She says no, that she wants a remote job where she can easily go to the city and also take care of her business and see her family, and the jobs she finds are in the big city .\n\nI explained that such a move would result in a significant pay cut for me (over half), as my certification from college is the lowest tier in the field, and I’d have to start building up from there. Since I’ve changed career path earlier, my only job prospects in this current career path are contract jobs, lacking job security, benefits and the good pension plan I have now. \n\nAlso, how would we pay our bills since she’s not working and we can’t guarantee job stability for her in her field. Since she had been laid off twice now from two different jobs, and her business doesn’t make much money.\n\nWe had a heated argument, and I mentioned asking her about living in this place before proposing which she agreed to then, but now she claims things have changed that we are married,  she didn’t know I was serious about staying here then and she made the decision out of love.\n\nI’m at a point where I think we should go our separate ways, I think she would regret staying here, and I won’t hear the end of it.\n\n\nAm I being too logical about this?

      "content": "Partner and I have been going through it lately and i said I didn’t want it anymore. So semantically we have been separated for a week. \n\nThey had came to my apartment last night after a dart match (definitely had drank a bit but not wasted or anything) we did talk a bit nothing bad happened or anything.. they did ask or try to have sex but I declined and they left around 1030/1045 pm. \n\nI had received texts throughout the day by them asking to have sex and such and still felt I should decline. \n\nTonight, we were getting in the car to go to our child’s game and I hate that I even felt I needed to do this.. but when they had to run back in the house to grab something.. I pulled up the messages on the car head unit. 😶 well it showed a message saying I’m here to another person. \n\nNow, while yes seeing that naturally was upsetting to me, realistically and honestly it wasn’t anything I could be mad about or say was wrong of them, because I was the one who said I didn’t want it, we weren’t together technically so whatever went on there they were entitled doing. What realllllly didn’t sit right with me, was the timestamp which was from around 11pm the night before. \n\nJust to clarify they came to me, wanting sex around 9/10 but left 1030/1045 and left my house and went straight to that persons arriving around 11pm. Only to then continue to ask me for sex again the next day. Hm. \n\nBecause of history of omissions and deception, I think that I chose to approach this a particular way to ultimately decide if being with them was in fact something I wanted and if it were worth the fight we’ve been fighting. \n\nLike I said, obviously the thought wasn’t great for me so it wasn’t a matter of me trying to call them out for doing something if anything, it was a matter of seeing if I would be told. \n\nAfter the game we got to my house, and before they left I asked how their night was last night. (I did receive several texts from them up until 2am so obviously after leaving me they were still awake for some time) the conversation went like this \n\nMe- how was your night last night?\nThem- it was ok, darts then was here then I went home\nMe- oh did you?\nThem- ??? \nMe- after leaving here last night, you went home? \nThem- yes I went home. \nMe-oh okay\nThem- what\nMe- are you sure you went home? You didn’t stop and see (name from text) before going home?\nThem- what are you talking about?\nMe- what am I talking about? Let me show you, even though we both know you know what I am asking…\nI had taken a quick photo when I saw in the car and showed it to them pointing out the times etc. \nthem- 😦 (literally)\nMe- hm that’s all I needed, haha you’re funny I have to say, have a good night and then shut my door. \n\nIf I’m being honest, yes the thought and fact that I know they were with someone else doesn’t make me feel good whatsoever but again, in their defense they did not do anything wrong as we weren’t together.. but I’m extremely bothered that because of us not being together, I wasn’t told the truth. \n\nBc ok fine, you had a one night stand while we were not together, not thrilled about it obviously but also not what I was looking to get when I asked. I really asked because I wanted to know if they would be honest. \n\nthe thought of coming to me for sex but not getting it, got it elsewhere, but then the next morning was back to asking again. Made me uncomfortable, bc how am I supposed to know if a condom was involved how am I supposed to know if that person’s sex life is also consistent of others as well etc or anything if to my knowledge, i had my partner looking to have sex with ME last night and again throughout the day today knowing they had sex with someone else in between. \n\nWe had gone back n forth thru text after the fact, obviously stated how hurt I was bc I was looked in the face and then lied to. And how I felt it wasn’t appropriate considering it opened the door for me to possibly catch something from it. They went on about how they were manipulated and I set them up by doing this. Bc they didn’t lie they just didn’t tell me something I didn’t need to know. “Again its none of your business. You. Left. Me. You don't get to know about my life and what I do and who I do it witu” was actually a text they sent to me. \n\nSo, AIO? Was I manipulating them? I did really just want to be told, I think they felt if they had admitted it it would have been followed by even more of a fight bc they knew it would hurt or upset me to know they slept with another person. Which sure I guess I could understand bc ya I’m quite upset, but I don’t feel that justified trying to keep it from me either. Especially considering multiple sex partners being involved. \n\nPlease, can I have some of your thoughts on this??? I would really appreciate it 😊😊\n",

He immediately called up his mom and dad and told them I said that.\n\nAny thing I say gets back to them \n\n\nI spent about 2 months planning an itinerary to Europe that he really didn't help much on and he sent it over to his family so they could use it. I told him I was upset by that because that was months or work on my end and no on helps me do anything. He took me saying I'm upset as an attack on his family and messaged both parents exactly what I said and involved them in yet again another argument. \n\nInvolving parents is something he's been doing relentless for years. And my parents have made it clear they do not want to hear about our arguments. For reference I am 33 and he's 31. I feel like a child in my marriage with constant parental involvement. I feel like I can never say anything or be upset about anything without him either calling his family immediately or threatening to call his family unless I apologize. \n\nI'm just at a point where I don't know if I can stay in this marriage. I have never felt more immature and childlike than in this marriage with parents constantly policing my behavior \n\nWe tried therapy. He complained about it. Lasted maybe 2 months \n\n\nThe parent involvement has never stopped and I don't know if it ever will",

      "content": "Tldr: 27F broke up with 26M after 3 months together due to mental health issues. I want to reach out to him,  it's been 5 days since the break up. \n\nHi everyone,\n\nI feel silly for posting here, but I'm a complete mess and I have no one in my life I can talk to about it. \nIn short, in December last year my partner of 8+ years broke up with me. It was really hard, we lived together for 5 years, had a cat, I moved to a different country for him. When he broke up with me I couldn't see a life without him but the thing is, while we were together we had many issues and I often felt unappreciated, unloved. I often thought of ending it, I just never had the courage - he was my first and only relationship, I was afraid no other person would want to be with me. \n\nHe moved out mid January and roughly 2-3 weeks later I made an account on a dating app, I said to myself that it's not to meet anyone, I only wanted validation, to see if anyone would ever want me. But I met someone.\n\nI kept thinking it's too early to jump into another relationship but I felt this huge pull towards him. I couldn't get him out of my head and I felt this passion on my heart. \nAnd he was amazing, thoughtful, attentive, romantic, understanding. He did things for me I though no one would ever do. I think he would be the healthiest relationship in my life. \nBut my mental health kept spiraling out of control until I got really sui***al and decided I need to be alone, so I broke up with him. It's been 5 days and I'm only doing worse. I keep thinking I made the biggest mistake of my life. That I ran away from him because it was the first time I had someone be so good to me and I felt unworthy of it. I keep thinking I want to reach out to him, get back together, but I'm scared that my mental health is just going to keep getting worse and I'll hurt him more. \n\nI have an appointment with a psychiatrist this month, which makes me even more upset that I didn't wait to get that kind of help before ending this relationship. \n\n I'm conflicted between what I want (being with him), what I'm scared of (getting worse and hurting him), and what I should do (I don't want to play with his feelings). The thing is, he followed his ex right after we broke up, and he kept telling me how toxic and bad she was for him, which makes me question how true his words really were. But I feel like we were meant to be together and I keep thinking that I don't know how long I'm gonna live for, and if I'd die tomorrow, I'd want him by my side. Can I reach out to him and ask for forgiveness, to try again?\n\n\n\n\n",

We have our good 1-2 months of peace and then all goes back to shit. After everytime I have to \"make up\" for all the damage I've made for trying to break up and she brings up a lot the fact that I tried to break up with her. She's told me that she's forgiven me but i saw a tiktok that said that it wasn't something forgiven if it was still being used as a weapon or something to use against me. Right now I have this feeling to break up with her because I was talking with my psycologist and even her was like so amazed of all the inmature conducts that she has and it is a really toxic relationship. She usually self harms wihht her nails on her arm or her face or pulls her hair, she get panic attacks and I feel it has a real weight on me that's why I usually keep working things back. Tomorrow I meet her on a park at 8am to talk about our heavy fight today. How do I end things up? I also feel bad because just to avoid more problems because I had a lot of collegue assignments to do I told her everything was gonna be alright and I loved her, I still do but I think it is going to be a real jerk move from me.

Just days before he was talking about trying and do everything that we can to work it out. Yesterday after days of silence he told me that he choosed, he wants to be alone, he does not want it anymore, but the first time he sat down he told me he also tought about asking me for more time because he was not very sure. I said no it does not make sense that i wait more and stay stuck for god knows why. Later I sent him a message for a thing related to an account where I have to remove them and asked his if he thinks it would have been worth it to give him more time. He replied “I think so. But I m not the one to decide this and i respect if you dont want to wait anymore. I want to be alone now”.  I told him to take the time he needs. I dont know if I made the right choice. My tought was to use this as a levarage to move on because it makes a little but easier also for me. But i dont know. And I dont understand how someone that does not want to see you anymore and close it responds “I think so” and not something as “ I really dont know “ or “ probably not” . And trust me that he is been cold and honest the whole time so he could have said it. I dont know. What do you think? \nFor errors im sorry, english is not my first lenguage.",

I believed him and accepted all the breadcrumbs and blame shifts. Eventually last week, I realized he has a new girl and he felt very distant and I knew he was trying to slowly fade me away. But he also texted me the very same week and this week that he misses me and that he is nowhere near emotionally available to be dating. He doesn't know that I know that he has a girl. My friends also found him on dating apps and I confronted him and of course, it is my fault because we weren't really \"together\" during this time.\n\nNow I know everyone told me to just let go, go full no contact and start moving on. But I'm so hurt from being led on, still believing in us and our future and the intense love. I know it was toxic but I still loved him wholeheartedly. I tried moving on but I kept yearning him for some reason. Now that he has a girl but has the audacity to lie to my face that he'd never date someone else because he loved me and how he spends all his time at work but in reality he's just going on dates, can I confront him or it's not going to bring me peace? I know it won't go anywhere but I also wish that he knew I knew because he thinks I'm so stupid to be believing in all his lies and that there is no someone else in the picture right now. He punished me for having guy friends or talking to people potentially and it's so hurtful that he is doing the exact same thing or more yet living a double life and texting me as if he's some saint who did no wrong whatsoever. I know the mature thing is no contact. But is it bad if I list out all the lies and tell him I know and that he's a liar? It's coming from my hurt and I know it's not healthy. I just feel so sad bottling all this up myself when he doesn't even care and had the last say in this relationship as a moral high ground.",

      "content": "Hello, my BF '29M' and I  '25 F' have been together for nearly 4 years, living together for 3. We are planning our future, getting a car, getting maried, kids and the whole shebang. \n\nHe is a very loving, caring, supportive partner, loves kids and would definitely make a great dad, and I love him. But he cant keep a job, he hasn't had one he would last in for a full year. \n\nWe started dating, he graduated form university in script writing for movies, got a server job at a bar. It was a bad place to work, he grinded for like half a year to save up so he could quit and live comfortably as he focuses on his writing. Then half a year passes, during that time he got screwed over when writing a series, money he saved up was spent on living expenses, so he got a job as a storage worker for a shop. \n\nIt was hard work, but during like 9 months or se that he worked there he kept looking for another job, where he wouldn't have to work a mannual job and could use his degree. He found one - he worked at a studio that creates youtube videos for children, essentially brain rot content, iykyk. Then management changed, he got fired, as he was late a couple times (but stayed after hours, and the employers stressed that being late is not a big deal, as long as you do your tasks, which he did). He got fired because, as they said, he was sometimes a bit late and the videos he wrote did not get the views, and that he did not abide by the new writing system (which they did not even tell him about, and when he pointed it out, they said, we will not be looking back to find out). \n\nThen he was unemployed for a bit, getting some money from the government, but over time the payments were reduced, he struggled getting a job. He took on jobs in logistics, in one he was fired within 3 weeks, and the other job he lasted 3 months. \n\nThen again, he looked for a job, and it again seemed impossible. Then he started working on a freelance based principle with a company selling knives, he was writing ads for them. Now, at around 6 month mark they fired him, saying his ads did not perform well enough, and that he made mistakes (the mistakes they are talking about were made 4 months ago, when he was still in training). \n\nAnd I know that several companies that fired him were just not making profit at the time so they had to make cuts, like the company where he was writing videos for kids, one logistics company, and now the knife business. \n\nAnd its driving me nuts, I am anxious every day, every time he says he had some hard days at work. He lost the job at the business just a couple days ago, and I feel a huge pit in my stomack over finances. \n\nFor contrast, during the time we were together, i had a job as project manager for 2 years, then due to restructuring, I lost it. With a month or two, I got a job at a company, that appeared to be shady, they fired me at 3 month mark because they didnt have money to pay me salary anymore. And now nearly for a year, I work at a government agency, very secure and stable job. During the times I wasnt working, government paid me decent amount of money due to me having a good salary prior. \n\nAnd now I feel at an impasse. I am afraid that this will be my life, where I am always the dependable one, and he keeps on getting jobs, getting fired,  then getting other jobs... no stability. And I love him, but the more this goes on, I feel like I am in living nightmare stressing about finances. How do i go about the situation?",

      "content": "tl;dr - my first post on here so sorry if it’s not clear To set the scene, I met this guy, let’s call him Brandon, thru a dating app. We met last summer, 2024 so I’ve know him for about a year. We went on two dates which he kindly paid for. On the first date, he surprised me with a tshirt of one our fav sports team. It was very kind and unexpected. Second date was a concert and was overall a good time. We would make occasional small talk and keep touch on snap. But at the end of the summer I had to back to my college out of state and made it clear I didn’t want to do distance. We still kept in touch but I was going on other dates since I was still since. He would randomly send me gifts, very nice ones (3 total). Which honestly made me feel like he was love bombing me at first, but I really just think that gift giving is his love language. I was a student athlete as well and he tuned into almost all my games. It was very sweet. Now to today, he asked me out again since I was back in town and I said yes bc well I’m still single and let’s see where it goes. Well he is ofc still very sweet but I got this feeling that I really wasn’t that into him. He’s a hard worker and a great person, but idk why I got this feeling that we wouldn’t really mesh in the long run. He has said that I give him butterflies and make him feel nervous in a good way. I don’t get that feeling, and I’ve been in 3 previous relationships so ik the feeling. Now I’m unsure how to bring this up to him. I want to be honest, but I don’t want it to come off like I was just taking advantage of his time or generosity. I want to be kind, but also direct so I don’t unintentionally lead him on. Has anyone had to navigate something similar, where the person is great, but the connection just isn’t there? How did you approach it? wrong to want to stay friends? ",

      "content": "About two months ago, my girlfriend lost a friend to suicide. At the time, we had only been dating for about three months, and I had never heard her mention this person before. So initially, I didn’t realize how deeply it would affect her, but it hit her hard.\n\nShe became distant, emotionally withdrawn, and stopped communicating like she used to. As much as that hurt, I understood that she was going through something traumatic. I didn’t feel it was right to ask for more affection or attention when she was clearly in pain. I did my best to be there for her and support her however I could.\n\nAround three weeks after the funeral, I started to see small signs of emotion return. But soon after, she began EMDR therapy to process past traumas. That’s when things seemed to change even more.\n\nSince then, it feels like she’s completely lost interest in me. She no longer tells me she misses me or makes any effort to see me. She never says \"I love you\" unless it's out of obligation. Where she once enjoyed texting, calling, and spending time with me, now our conversations are brief and distant. In person, she's a bit warmer, but still not like she used to be.\n\nI’ve tried to talk to her about it. She tells me that she does love me and is happy with me, but that she feels guilty for not being able to return the love I’m giving her right now. She says she doesn’t know when, or if, she’ll feel back to normal.\n\nI love her deeply and want to support her through this, but it's been emotionally exhausting. It hurts to feel like I’m giving so much and getting nothing back. At the same time, I don’t want to pressure her or make her feel responsible for my emotional needs while she’s going through such a hard time.\n\nBut truthfully, I think about this constantly. I’m stressed every day, wondering if she even wants to be with me anymore. I feel stuck between wanting to support her and needing some reassurance that I still matter to her.\n\nI really don’t know what to do.",

I even decided to apply for a job in the same town but he told me not too chase “love” so I didn’t go for it. I regret it though as it was a perfect job and opportunity for our love to blossom.\n\nHe introduced me to his friend’s group twice. My biggest regret was not letting him into my world. He did hint and it but never asked to be let in.\n\nWe bonded after he faced judgement from his family and I was his number one supporter. A unique experience bonded us where his parents surprised us one night at his house. \n\nHe ended things with me as I was emotionally cheating I only did that because I was lonely and I told him that. I didn’t realise how much it affected him but it happened again but I didn’t realise it hurt him.\n\nAfter he broke up with me the first time. He asked me “where could he find me” this made me chase him. we were in a 3 month situation-ship but it was hard as I emotionally drained him I think as I was looking at what we had in the past and he was trying to move forward. He mentioned not wanting “commitment” and just wanting to do activities and go away on holiday together. I agreed and showed interest in doing that but nothing was said further.\n\nOur whole relationship I have been honest and told him exactly how I feel but the last time I saw him I asked him to go on a parkrun with me and my friends but he didn’t turn up. So I rang him after the event and he asked too see me that night. That’s when I ruined it I got too intimate and emotional as I felt overwhelmed being in his presence and I think I scared him by doing so. I also tried bringing him home but he rejected me.\n\nWe both have traditional upbringing and values but his are a bit more deeper than mine. Mine has had a lot more childhood trauma though.\n\nI told him to meet me December 20th this year to try and recreate our first date, I told him I hope to be a better man by then… is it too late? Is it best to give up? Or wait and see if he reaches out during this period of no contact? Usually I’m always the one reaching out. I miss him so much.\n",

We dated for a few months here, then she went back to her country.\n\nAfter a while, we started talking again, and after a couple of months, we talked everyday, with occasional videocalls, and later I decided to go on a 2 weeks trip with her around her country\n\nWe were still talking, I moved to another european country for my job this year, and we started having problems, I think mostly (at least in my case) I was very tired of only talking by videocall and chat (I dont really like chatting) and I wanted something real. She was willing to move here with me, but I wasn't 100% sure, and I didnt want her to change her whole life if I was not certain. So I decided the best thing to do was breaking the relationship.\n\nFirst weeks I was okay, even relieved because this thing was making me overthink a lot, but after a while, I started thinking on her a lot. I talked to girls here, but Im not really interested in getting to know other people. A lot of days I imagine how it could be seeing her entering into the apartment after work, cooking or watching a movie in the couch together. Ive been single for a long time (think I have a deep fear of commitment, specially after past experiences) but now Im longing for something more stable and I think she had some kind of special connection with me, I felt understood, loved, and I could be myself with her.\n\nI thought a lot in writing her a letter explaining all this, and reconnecting with the hope of starting a life together in a few months, but even when a lot of days I think about it and I would love to have that life, other times Im just \"nah, Im okay, I think that will be a mistake\".\n\nI dont think Im in love (yet) with her but I think that love is something that can be built, and I firmly believe that we can be compatible and we can build a live together, I think we can be happy. And I really desire that. But then these moments of doubt come and they make me stop. What are your thoughts guys? Thanks in advance",

We started chatting and ended up meeting in person by accident one day, talked for 2 hours, and really had a nice connection. We then planned to meet again the next day and got intimate ( not sex)\n\nAfter that, I noticed he started acting distant. He now barely texts me – maybe once a day. I really liked him and I’m not sure how to interpret his behavior. He did ask me to go to the beach with him again (no intimacy this time, just for fun), but I’m unsure if he’s serious about me or not.\n\nI’d love to hear your thoughts or similar experiences – especially from people who understand dating culture in Algeria or North Africa. What would you do in my place?\n\nThanks for reading.\n(English is my third language, sorry for any mistakes!)\n",

I thought regardless of how fast things were going, we were on the same page. Recently Tee has been struggling to get or stay hard. I thought maybe it were because he was sick and tired. However some time has passed now and we are still having this issue. Recently it happened and so I opened up the discussion. I asked him what’s happening. He essentially told me how he keeps thinking about stuff I had opened up to him about. It makes him feel as though he’s taking advantage of me. I wasn’t expecting to hear that at all. It really stung that I am being open and vulnerable with this person. I had no idea that’s how he saw me. I really like him and he says he really likes me. I honestly thought of maybe ending things. He thinks it’s something we could maybe work through but obviously not guaranteed. I basically have to decide whether I’m willing to give it a chance. I don’t know if I can. I don’t know how comfortable I am to be open and vulnerable with him again, which is something important to me. I still really like him. However now it feels that the once great connection we had, there’s a disconnect. I don’t know. Any advice would help.\n",

      "content": "Hey guys,\n\ni’ve (26M) dated my (26f) girlfriend for almost 1.5 years now, and have been involved with her son (4 year old) for about 10 months. We live seperate and both are nurses and work on the same unit.\n\nSO has 50/50 custody with the father, and she takes the kid monday-thursday typically.\n\nI hope to go back to grad school in 1-2 years for CRNA and will be gone for 3 years out of state (which she wouldn’t not be able to come with me due to custody).\n\nI feel like our relationship has been a typical relationship with pretty decent communication. She does come with her baggage, and the difficult part is getting her to get into therapy, take her take her meds consistently, but otherwise I enjoy the relationship her and I have and I love her very much. For awhile things have been super good, and we have had lots of fun us 3. For the last 3 months, I have been having stronger feelings of being “third party” in the relationship and almost feel like I don’t belong every time us 3 are all together. When I see her son, I don’t see him as my own (which I understand is ok). When he throws tantrums or is disrespectful me, I feel like it’s hard to tolerate someone else’s child talking to me like this. But I also have a hard time feeling a sense of being proud of him when he does good things, is learning etc, and having good emotions, and overall just can only feel the negative affects and feel disconnected from her son, and it can feel like I am just tolerating him because I love her.\n\nI have spoken with her about this 2 months ago, as well as have had a therapy session and we came up with ideas such as 1:1 time to build my relationship with him and just try to be more involved in care such as bedtime stories, making dinner, etc. Since doing this, I am not sure if I feel any different, and I can feel as if I don’t look forward to spending time with him, though I do look forward to spending time with my girlfriend. We both figured this is something I have to figure out and work on, or else we may have to part ways. Since that conversation it understandably created uncertainty and insecurity for her and has been feeling more rocky since especially the last few weeks. she begs for me to not leave as she can’t go through the same feelings as her divorce of being alone. I can’t help but very often feel guilty this entire time as it feels like I am causing all this hurt and conflict because of my lack of ability to fix things to where we want them to be, as I can see it causes her distress, and her insecurities cause tensions in our relationship at times. I feel like I feel constant pressure from it all and it can make me worry about the future and think maybe we should break up. (Which she knows I have had thoughts of due to the frequent hard conversations). \n\n\nIs this something where the excitement of the relationship has run its course and maybe we are incompatible, or do you guys have any advice or ideas of how to continue?\n\nAnything is appreciated.",

For the sake of this post I’m going to refer to my roommate as “Ally” and her new gf as “Marly”.\n\nAlly is bi and this is her first girlfriend and first real relationship tbh. Ally met Marly off of hinge and Marly revealed that she was fresh out of a breakup. They started dating exclusively after 1 week and then said “I love you” practically the next week. I feel like Ally is being love bombed like crazy. There’s a difference between loving loudly and straight lovebombing, Marly is posting her on instagram with caption “my wife” and constantly posting notes “I love my gf” or “I miss my wife”\n\nThen Marly also just straight up ignores the rest of us. She comes into our house and will look us right into the eyes and walk past us. She’ll never speak to any of our roommates or friends. I think this is just rude!! Where are her manners?!?! For about 2 weeks I boycotted and didn’t say anything to her, and guess what?? Nary a word from her lips. Finally the other day I decided to end that and went out of my way to say hi to her, she looked at me, and pet my dog (that I was holding on a leash) and didn’t say A WORD to me. Okay I dont wanna make this too long so now I’m moving on the to next point but just know that there plenty more examples.\n\nSHE ACTS LIKE A BABY. She can never speak for herself, cook for herself, clean up after self, look after herself, etc!!! It’s like she relies at Ally for EVERYTHING. Marly got mad at Ally once because Ally didn’t pack her a towel for the beach??? Like is Ally your mom? Anyways she also complains about the food that Ally cooks for her because she not only acts like a 5 year old, but eats like one too. Again, there are more examples but I’m moving on for the sake of both your and my time.\n\nI know this technically isn’t my place at all. But I want to look out for Ally, she is so sweet and has major problems saying no or setting boundaries. This is her first relationship so I understand how this can be hard, but none of my other roommates like her either, for the same reasons, and we just don’t want to see this end badly.\n\nI’m not looking for people to tell me to mind my own business and whatever, I’m posting on here because idk why it’s bugging me so much and that’s why I’m using this as my outlet, thank you!",

      "title": "I 29m think I have found myself in an abusive relationship with 24f",
      "content": "Almost two weeks ago, my gf found out she was pregnant again. We both love our first born very much. She is the light of our life and we both want the world for her. However S/O was devastated and has been an emotional wreck since. She does not want to keep it and I do. But I understand she must make the decision and I have told her it’s up to her.\n\nHer reasoning for not wanting to keep it is 1.) she wants to go to school 2.) if anything were to happen to me she wouldn’t be able to handle it on her own 3.) she’s too unstable as it is and wants to focus on treating our daughter well and being a better person toward me.\n\nThere’s three situations that happened this week that have now pushed me over the edge and I don’t know what to do.\n\nA.) she told her therapist that she would want to honor the baby after aborting it by making a “vigil” type of thing and burying whatever comes out in the back yard. The therapist apparently thought this was a healthy idea if it makes her feel better. I did not act out to her at all, I just told her that makes me uncomfortable and I don’t think I’d be okay with that. To her that’s me being an asshole and unsupportive.\n\nB.) she just got a job about 2 months ago (one I convinced her to get since I thought it would be healthier for our relationship. Different story.). She is now enjoying this job and seems very committed and is considering career pathways. Well, she needs a car as we only have one. I have spent almost two months car searching on my own. Scouring the internet and making appointments to see cars. It’s a bit of effort obviously but no big deal we are a team right? As a man, it’s just a responsibility I gladly took on for her at her request. She had 5k from her grandma. Every car we look at I didn’t feel good about, and she constantly got upset with me asking me what do I know about cars. Whatever I get she is frustrated as I am too but that’s a little rude. Well I finally find her one for 6k plated and registered in her name. I cover the extra 1k. In my mind this will make her happy! She’s working hard and I don’t want her to struggle with her first few paychecks and I make more money so let me do this for you type of thing. In her mind I’m doing that with malicious intent so that I can hold it over her head. I wanted a thank you. I told her babe all I need is a smile and a thank you and we’re good. To her that’s me being “something else” and only helping her because I want something out of it to benefit myself or my ego…\n\nC.) when she got a job, I adjusted my schedule at work so that I work 3rd shift, and can watch our 1 year old while she works during the day. I just see it as what I have to do since we can’t afford daycare. I get it’s stressful and I am actively searching for a better job with a set schedule. So l work 8 hours, commute 2 hours, watch our baby girl alone for 8 hours, leaving me with 6 hours to do what I have to do as well as get some sleep.  And I sleep when she gets home from work as that 6 hour window is from 4pm to 10pm. Yesterday before work I slept for 3 hours. I average 4 hours a day. She called me at 3:45 and said she wanted to run to the store to get some stuff for dinner and I asked if she could take our daughter with so I could maybe get 5 hours of sleep before work tonight. The store is not far from our house. She replied no and that she’s tired too. Obviously, I was annoyed and I kinda was like whatever. She ends up pulling up to the house and tells me to switch out the car seat and she will take her. Before she pulled up she called me 5 repeatedly just to tell me to have her ready to go. I simply asked her how much hours of sleep she got last night to help her see how sleep deprived I am on a regular basis. And that out of respect for me she could just not give me a hard time about it. She flips out to the point I locked her out of the house because I didn’t want to deal with it. I told her I’d have the door unlocked when she got back. She pounded on the door for 10 minutes before going to the grocery store. When she got home she knew I was trying to sleep at this point. We was slamming doors walking in and out of the house and ringing the doorbell over and over. She came in the room and would not get out of my face even though I begged her to just let me sleep telling her I only had 4 hours left. She refused to leave, and turned the lights on and ripped down the blanket I put in the window to block the sun. Telling me I don’t deserve sleep. She did this twice. Told me she can’t wait to abort the baby and leave me.\n\nShe tells me all the time that she can’t wait to go to school and graduate and make more money and leave me. Then cries and says she didn’t mean any of it. She tells me she’s miserable and hates the house I put us in, but then turns around and says she has nowhere to go\n\nHonestly there’s a lot of other baggage from like the first year of hour relationship that she never gave me closure on in the way that I would have liked. But I want this family. Our daughter deserves one. It just feels so wrong for us to give up now. Idk. But I think this shit is killing me ",

      "content": "I (M50) have been with my partner for close to 16 years now and have a 14 year old child. \n\nIn the past 5 or so years I’ve become increasingly concerned at the distance growing between us although day to day life is largely conflict free in part due to our generally conflict avoidant personalities but also our easy goingness \n\nI have suspected ADHD, I know this because my daughter has AuADHD as does my son from another relationship.   As such I have a high interest in novelty, new hobbies, new interests, getting out of the house.  \n\nMy partner is a homebody who becomes distressed if plans are changed on her suddenly, so I learned long ago to not surprise her with sudden plans.   She’s also an extremely avoidant of speculation and forward thinking.   She has no specific plans for the future, simply “to see how we go” “let’s just get through this year”.  If it’s in the future, it’s not something for us to discuss, although I know she plans deeply around things.  \n\nShe rarely leaves the house and hasn’t worked since our daughter was born.  Her interests are academic study (she’s accumulated multiple degree’s and pre and post graduate qualifications across a multitude of interests) and video games - an interest I used to more intensely share before I moved on, in part because I simply didn’t commit the time to playing and so our engagment became asymmetric on almost every game (me 1 hour a week, her 20+ hours). \n\nI work a demanding leadership job and am well paid.   I have learned to fly a plane, ride a motorbike, have lost 55lbs, take care of my health, have taken up gym and running, and have a couple of other hobbies. \n\nBut I do it all alone, with even limited involvement from my daughter, who my partner worries and manages on an hour by hour basis, anticipating almost every need and attempting to resolve every emotional concern of hers. \n\nShe is both deeply attentive to me (I have learned to fake my facial expressions lest they concern her) and yet largely disinterested in my day to day.  I cannot recall the last time she asked me about my working day.   When I have struggled over the years I’ve talked to her but a number of years ago I stopped talking because her advice was largely the same.  (Suck it up)\n\nI have almost total freedom to do as I wish.  As long as I do it alone. \n\nShe has a history of family abuse in her past and several chronic health issues including her wait (over 400lb) and deafness.  She refuses any kind of medical or psychological help and effectively is reliant on lip reading.  We have had several arguments about her seeking treatment but she is adamant nothing can be done. \n\nI live a comfortable life.  My day to day is largely pleasant.  I’m loved in a quiet way (not physically, we haven’t been intimate more than a few times in the past 5-10 years.  \n\nI’m torn between trying really hard, which would involve significant change on her part.   And simply giving up the relationship and dealing with the consequences of rebuilding my life. \n\nHelp me reddit. \n",

      "title": "30f and 29m planning and proactivity",
      "content": "So I don't know if I'm overreacting here but I can't shake the current feeling I have towards my boyfriend so just want to get some advice.\n\nContext, me and my boyfriend have been together for 4 years and we love to travel. In the entirety of our relationship I've planned all our holidays meticulously, book everything and while we're there create an itinerary etc. I didn't use to mind it because I just loved going away with him, however the past two years I've also gotten increasingly busy with work and taking on more house responsibilities while he has exams. The problem first started last year when I noticed I was getting increasingly tired and started asking for help planning trips but got very little in return (I planned his bday trip but very much had to hold his hand to plan mine to the point I found the hotels, flights etc. and we actually ended up having a bit of an argument at the end of the year where I expressed how drained I was coming back from holidays from constantly doing our planning and not relaxing and wishing he would do more.\n\nHere comes the current issue. This year was we had big landmark birthdays which was a big deal (which i communicated) we both agreed we would plan a big birthday holiday for the other person in their dream destination. (My bday is 3 months earlier in the year then him). By January I had already planned his bday, booked flights, accommodation and had an idea of everything i would do, and I was assuming he would do the same. However two months before my birthday I realised his still hadn't actually booked anything, i started giving him quite obvious hints which he seemed to ignore and a month before he still hadn't planned anything so i had to take the lead again, I found the flights, hotels, literally created a spreadsheet of all the things I'd love to do when we were there and shared it with him as well as an Instagram folder with so many ideas. Long story short, with two weeks before the holiday I had to start booking excursions, travel in the country etc. when we finally went away we realised he hadn't really booked any any restaurants, or had done any research and ignored my advice around how busy it would be (we visited in peak time). We had a bit of an argument about it because I felt like I'd basically begged him to organise this and he still didn't. His reply was he was stressed with exams and he did apologise and get me a really nice presents- but the issue is he didn't start revising until a month before my birthday so he has 5 months before of me asking him to do something. So like all holidays, although I had a great time I've come back drained and sad about the whole thing.\n\nAnd to come back and finishing planning his birthday I feel a bit unloved and cold towards the whole thing and honestly feel like I'm looking at him differently in not loving me the way i really needed him to. It wasn't a test but I feel different since we came back. I keep thinking about when we have kids is this my life. Working and planning and being proactive but feeling like someone has to be pushed to do so. It's also worth noting in the first year of our relationship i really had to beg him to organise dates and do things proactively (he does do that much better) but i feel like having to get to the point where I'm asking for romantic gestures that i'm doing intuitively takes the specialness out of it (here's where maybe I'm being a bit unfair).\n\nIs this overreacting or is there something I'm not seeing in this situation? We did have a great holiday but I genuinely feel like my 30th was a real let down. The rest of the trips in the year (friends weddings, group trips etc).\n\nTLDR: I plan all me and my boyfriends holidays and birthdays. He didn't bother to plan my 30th birthday even though he promised so I had to",

      "title": "Me (23M) and my girlfriend (22F) have been having increasing fights and I don't know how to deal with these anymore",
      "content": "Hi everyone, I'm making this post because I don't know what else to do, I have been having increasing fights with my partner related to her need for control. I already made a similar post on r/therapy asking on advice on how to confront her about her problem, and ask her to go to therapy, but I also wanted to make a post here and ask for advice relating to the relationship stuff. \n\n  \nSo for a bit of background, he have been together for four years, we met on our first year in college and are now about to begin our last year. We also have a business together, which we also run togheter. \n\n  \nThroughout our relationship we have had many fights, which I know is normal and healthy and there will always be continous issues in a relationship which will never get resolved. However, the main problem I feel we have is that she holds resentment in her heart towards me from our  fights, in fact she does this to anyone, except her mom, she is the only person I have noticed she doesn't hold resentment to. \n\n  \nWhenever we have a fight, she will give me the cold shoulder, she will never listen to my side of things, whe will only hear what she wants to hear instead of what I am actually saying, or she will simply not give me a chance to speak and walk off. She always does this, and it is not an I need to cool off, give me a moment and then we talk, it is a full on walking out of the relationship, if we are at her house, she will attempt to throw me out, she once even threatened me to leave or else she would have her father throw me out, which he heard and came to see what was happening, and thankfully made her reason about the situation, but if we are on a call she will hang up and not pick up if I call back. At one point I tried talking to her about it, and her behavior did change for a while, but its now come back and it is stronger than ever, on every fight we have she ends the relationship, but then after the anger goes away she comes back as if she didn't tell me she ended the relationship. \n\n  \nShe also doesn't measure the weight of her words when fighting. Whenever we fight I tend to keep my calm, not say anything that might be hurtful and use only facts to confront whatever she is saying, her on the other hand, insults me (once she called me retarded) and screams to me, she really likes to call me an idiot, despite me repeatedly asking her not to call me that. It really makes me feel bad, which I have told her, and she basically said that because of what I had done (not follow her rules) I didn't deserve respect. She once nearly realized how she treated me when in an argument I asked her to please respect me and not call me names, and she said I didn't respect her, I asked her back if I had ever called her names, during a fight or at any other time like she does to me, or to tell me what my reaction is when she makes a mistake (which I usually comfort her and, help her mend it), but then anger clouded her judgment and came back to her always being right and having the right to call me an idiot because she is the woman in the relationship. \n\n  \nThe other problems we have relate to my mother and my pet, she hates them both. She hates my mother, I have my suspicios, that it is because my mom doesn't fit the idea in her mind of what a mother or an adult woman should be (Her parents are quite conservative and my mom is the total opposite). And for some reason she hates my pet and wants me to get rid of it, which I won't do (you can guess why, but ask anybody that has a pet they love and they will tell you). \n\n  \nShe also tens to use punishments for me, giving me the cold shoulder, scoffing, not talking to me, withholding sex, not kissing me after an argument (even if she is not mad anymore), forcing me to pay for stuff, etc... (our sex life is basically dead at the moment, and has been for months)\n\n  \nI am honestly getting tired of her behavior, I have stayed in this relationship, enduring this things for 3 main reasons. The first and main one being that ending the relationship would be very messy right now. The second one being that I do love her, and at one point our relationship was great (and no, I'm not talking about the first few months when you are getting to know each other), but it has since declined a lot, we have gotten into a routine and I don't believe that neither of us are 100% happy at the moment. And three because, I believe that things can improve, I see the good in her, I just don't know how to get to it. I want to talk to her about all of this, and tell her that I need things to change, that I am not ok with how things are at the moment, but I don't know how. I don't know how I could get to her and tell her that if things don't change, the next time she tells me the relationship is over, I might actually take her word for it and end it. \n\n  \nI know you aren't supposed to get into a relationship expecting someone to change, and I also know that if you expect to look for happinnes in other people, and expecto to find happinness by changing other people things are never going to work out for you. But at this point, I need the dynamic between us to change, I know how she is as a person, I've known for quite a while now, and I decide to stay despite knowing her flaws, I don't believe anyone is perfect, I myself are not, and have a lot of areas I need to work on. But I don't know I guess I just need advice on how to navigate all of this. \n\nTo be honest with you all, I don't know if this relationship is over and I just haven't accepted it, if there is a chance to save I would take it, I am here mainly to ask for advice on how to tell her her actions are hurting me, that I need the dynamic to change, for her to be more conscious on how her actions affect me and others. \n\n¿Can someone please give me tips on how to deal with these situations? \n\n  \nTL;DR. My girlfriend and I have been having icnreasing fights, alongside other issues, but she has lately been calling me names and insulting me, which hurts me but she won't listen to me about it. The relationship is in decline and I want to talk to her about it, but I don't know how to do it without her going defensive and saying everything is my fault. ",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I (30F) have been in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend (33M). We met last October and officially started going out in January. Things felt promising, and even though it’s long distance, we built a strong emotional connection early on.\n\nHe started a new job in late November, and it’s been a tough adjustment for him. The work culture isn’t great, and I can tell it’s been mentally draining. I’ve tried to be understanding and supportive from a distance, thinking things would ease up after three months. Then I told myself maybe six months. But it’s now been over six months, and it still feels like he’s stuck in a place that’s burning him out.\n\nAt the same time, I’ve felt increasingly disconnected. We used to talk every day, have deep conversations, and check in with each other emotionally. Lately it feels like I’m the one always initiating. Sometimes I feel like I’m interrupting his day rather than being someone he’s happy to talk to. He doesn’t check in as often or ask how I’m really doing. It makes me question whether I still hold a meaningful place in his life.\n\nWe’ve been in a rough patch the past month. To his credit, I’ve seen him try to show that he’s listening to my needs, like texting me more or saying things he knows I need to hear. But it’s inconsistent. One day it feels like we’re reconnecting, and the next I feel completely distant from him again.\n\nHe also recently talked about how excited he is to be back in our city playing hockey, seeing his friends, enjoying the things he missed. I asked where I fit into that picture, and he said, “That’s a given.” But honestly, it didn’t feel like it. I had to ask just to be acknowledged.\n\nOn my end, I’ve been struggling too. I’m job hunting, living far from family, and often feeling isolated. I’ve leaned on this relationship as one of the few stable things in my life. Maybe too much. And I’m starting to wonder if I’m holding onto something out of habit, or fear of being completely alone, rather than because it’s truly fulfilling me.\n\nI don’t want to be unfair to him, he’s under a lot of pressure, and I know he’s not trying to hurt me. But I also can’t ignore how invisible I’ve felt. I’ve been thinking about asking for space. Not a breakup (at least not yet), just space so I can redirect my energy and stop waiting around for things to feel right again. I want to talk to him in person when he comes back, but I’m scared I’ll keep putting it off.\n\nAm I being too sensitive or impatient? Is this just a rough season that needs patience or is this relationship not meeting me where I am anymore? And if I want to emotionally detach without making a dramatic move, how do I even start?\n\nThanks in advance for reading. Any thoughts, advice, or similar experiences are really appreciated.",

Sorry for my English its not my first language \n\nFor some context \nMy mum 44 F left my dad 40 m when i was 3 months old, because my dad didn't really help her to raise me. He was mostly on parties ect. To his defense he was only 18/19 yo to this time but i think its not an excuse for that. I mean i didn't really see him till i turned like 7/8 yo. It's also that I found out that he was my dad. I saw him then every 2-3 months and at birthdays and holidays. But i never saw him as a dad. Even my stepdad 39 m i don't really see him a dad. Both are more cool friends if yall understand what i mean. I mean i didn't really grow up with a father figure. I should also mention that I'm autistic and suffer from adhd, depression and bpd. It might be important lol. After i ended up in a Psych ward with the age of 17 he started that i can visit and stayed overnight every 2 to 3 weeks till i started to work. Right now I'm living in a dorm in a special facility for people with disabilities to an apprenticeship, go to school and some more. And my parents and stepparents are like friends under each other. I mean my stepdad and dad go sometimes to a football game and my stepmum cuts our hair (she is a professional hairdresser)\n\nNow to the issue:\nMy mum, sis, stepdad and i was invited to my bio dads birthday party. It was a bigger one with a disco, great food and alcohol. My mum, sis and stepdad did go earlier bc my stepdad was very drunken. I was a bit tipsy and decided to smoke weed (its legal in my country) and my dad saw dad. He put me aside and talked to me about that. He said something like: ik that I'm legally an adult but especially with my mental health ect its not good for me. We then talked about what i want for life and that he wanna try to be there for me and he took me in his arms.\nIdk how to feel. At one side i want him more like a dad but on the other side I'm scared that if I'm pushing too hard he will start to distance from me. I mean he is thinking about me for example he asked me if want something from Japan since he was going on a vacation there. I told him my fav Pokémon that i want a plush one. And some other stuff like he teaches me tricks to save money and we are texting daily and he promised me a flat in his house when financially stable enough and Im mentally stable enough \n\nI'm gonna visit him in 2 weeks and i want to talk about this\n\nSo reddit can ur help me here please\n\nTldr: my dad was not really in my life till i was seven and now he started to be more of a dad and i want that but I'm scared",

I have had two previous partners, and I am his first girlfriend. He has felt insecure about this for a while, but recently it has gotten really bad. He constantly compares himself to them, to the point where he obsesses over it. I reassure him and apologize to him so much, but nothing has helped. Last night, he discovered that I still had a Minecraft server that my ex and I played on (I haven’t opened the game in forever and completely forgot to delete it). It sent him spiraling. He ended up self-harming (and this really triggered me because I used to, though I’m three years clean). I am not sure what to do. It seems like nothing helps him. He doesn’t have access to therapy at the moment. This is really affecting our relationship.",

      "title": "I 29m have found myself in an abusive relationship with 24f",
      "content": "I want to preface all of this by saying I made a post one other time, when she was pregnant with our first child, who we both love and adore very much. However, at the time I was very upset due to catching her in multiple lies over the course of our year long relationship. Long story short she there was cheating on her end as well as hanging on to some things from her past relationship behind my back. Things I felt like out of respect for your new relationship, anyone would have made sure they’d gotten rid of.\n\nAnyways people on here said a lot of mean things about her, and basically that I should run as far away as possible. She also says this to me all the time…\n\nI know that I am a little bit older than her, and maybe the way our relationship started wasn’t ideal. So I’ve remained faithful and wanting to make this work, especially for our daughter who again, we both love very much and I know we both want to give her the family she deserves.\n\nNow to the main part… almost two weeks ago, she found out she was pregnant again. She was devastated and has been an emotional wreck since. She does not want to keep it and I do. But I understand she must make the decision and I have told her it’s up to her. \n\nHer reasoning for not wanting to keep it is 1.) she wants to go to school 2.) if anything were to happen to me she wouldn’t be able to handle it on her own 3.) she’s too unstable as it is and wants to focus on treating our daughter well and being a better person toward me.\n\nThere’s three situations that happened this week that have now pushed me over the edge and I don’t know what to do.\n\nA.) she told her therapist that she would want to honor the baby after aborting it by making a “vigil” type of thing and burying whatever comes out in the back yard. The therapist apparently thought this was a healthy idea if it makes her feel better. I did not act out to her at all, I just told her that makes me uncomfortable and I don’t think I’d be okay with that. To her that’s me being an asshole and unsupportive. \n\nB.) she just got a job about 2 months ago (one I convinced her to get since I thought it would be healthier for our relationship. Different story.). She is now enjoying this job and seems very committed and is considering career pathways. Well, she needs a car as we only have one. I have spent almost two months car searching on my own. Scouring the internet and making appointments to see cars. It’s a bit of effort obviously but no big deal we are a team right? As a man, it’s just a responsibility I gladly took on for her at her request. She had 5k from her grandma. Every car we look at I didn’t feel good about, and she constantly got upset with me asking me what do I know about cars. Whatever I get she is frustrated as I am too but that’s a little rude. Well I finally find her one for 6k plated and registered in her name. I cover the extra 1k. In my mind this will make her happy! She’s working hard and I don’t want her to struggle with her first few paychecks and I make more money so let me do this for you type of thing. In her mind I’m doing that with malicious intent so that I can hold it over her head. I wanted a thank you. I told her babe all I need is a smile and a thank you and we’re good. To her that’s me being “something else” and only helping her because I want something out of it to benefit myself or my ego…\n\nC.) when she got a job, I adjusted my schedule at work so that I work 3rd shift, and can watch our 1 year old while she works during the day. I just see it as what I have to do since we can’t afford daycare. I get it’s stressful and I am actively searching for a better job with a set schedule. So l work 8 hours, commute 2 hours, watch our baby girl alone for 8 hours, leaving me with 6 hours to do what I have to do as well as get some sleep.  And I sleep when she gets home from work as that 6 hour window is from 4pm to 10pm. Yesterday before work I slept for 3 hours. I average 4 hours a day. She called me at 3:45 and said she wanted to run to the store to get some stuff for dinner and I asked if she could take our daughter with so I could maybe get 5 hours of sleep before work tonight. The store is not far from our house. She replied no and that she’s tired too. Obviously, I was annoyed and I kinda was like whatever. She ends up pulling up to the house and tells me to switch out the car seat and she will take her. Before she pulled up she called me 5 repeatedly just to tell me to have her ready to go. I simply asked her how much hours of sleep she got last night to help her see how sleep deprived I am on a regular basis. And that out of respect for me she could just not give me a hard time about it. She flips out to the point I locked her out of the house because I didn’t want to deal with it. I told her I’d have the door unlocked when she got back. She pounded on the door for 10 minutes before going to the grocery store. When she got home she knew I was trying to sleep at this point. We was slamming doors walking in and out of the house and ringing the doorbell over and over. She came in the room and would not get out of my face even though I begged her to just let me sleep telling her I only had 4 hours left. She refused to leave, and turned the lights on and ripped down the blanket I put in the window to block the sun. Telling me I don’t deserve sleep. She did this twice. Told me she can’t wait to abort the baby and leave me. \n\nShe tells me all the time that she can’t wait to go to school and graduate and make more money and leave me. Then cries and says she didn’t mean any of it. She tells me she’s miserable and hates the house I put us in, but then turns around and says she has nowhere to go. \n",

For a bit of back story we have been together for three years. When we first started dating we were very sexually active, however after around the first year of dating it started to get harder to be intimate with him. This is due to a few reasons 1. Being that i have a chronic illness (endometriosis), which makes sex pretty painful. By boyfriend understands this so tries to compromise by doing other things, but even that i struggle with! I do also struggle with a bit of trauma in sexual situations, so thinking it could be that, or maybe even the medications i am on it could be effecting my hormones.\nAnyways i just need some advice on how i can make my boyfriend feel appreciated without needing to be sexual? OR some advice on what i can do to help improve this aspect of myself if anyone else has been in the same position. \nI really hate it about myself and want to be better for my partner, but i just don’t know how to do it when i struggle so much.

I knew her for maybe about a month, I took my shot, and we had maybe one good week of flirting before she decided it would be better for us to be friends. It was upsetting, but I figured it would be okay to try to be friends. \n\nEventually things kinda fizzled out until the next month when she reached out again. We began dating, and we had three weeks together before she broke it off the morning before she left my apartment to go to work, stating she didn’t really feel love for me, and felt dissociated and felt trouble feeling love for anyone really. Valid reason of course, but I got really hung up on it after she left my place. Main comment that stuck was that while we may not get together in the future, if we did she would wanna be better for me. \n\nWe decided to be friends and yesterday was our first day hanging out together after the breakup. Once I got back home, I was very torn up on how I felt about the entire situation. Upset and overthinking certain aspects of the day. \n\nI don’t feel like it’s normal to feel love so early on like this cause I do care for her, maybe we moved to quick, but I can’t seem to shake the feelings of love even after just a short time together and it is upsetting to me not being together anymore. \n\nAny advice for what I could do?\n\n",

      "content": "So I have a situationship where my woman said she was getting a social media break and suddenly she feels depressed, i dont know the reason but it's probably about her family. I was constantly reaching and checking her if she's okay and if she's eating peoperly but she didn't respond to me, I'm just expecting even a little response like if she needs space or what. I didn't received any response. depression is not a joke, i only demand a short message if she was okay and 1 week later i still didn't received an update from her even though i can see her online. My mind was confused and I don't know what to do as a Man, like as in i was left hanging in a dark place seeking an answer because I truly loved her and she's really important to me, I don't want her to carry the burden alone, it makes me feel worthless. \n\nUntil, after a week without getting a response , I jumped into conclusion by unfollowing her on all of her socials and i regret doing that(i lately realized that i was dumb about that, like I don't know what to do by that time when i needed her). She reached me the morning by the time the unfollowing happened, she said why did i unfollowed her. And i told her the reason why I suddenly give up. I was just humbly asking for a little response from her because i genuinely care, but my mind was confused and i thought unfollowing her would be giving me peace and accepted that this won't work anymore.\n\nShe replied 2 days after I told her the reason. She was sorry about that, it was not her intention to left me hanging for 1 week it just happened that she has feeling depressed and don't want to communicate with others even me. She also said that i was unfair, because when she needed space and trust, i just gave up. Yeah i admit that i was impatient by that time. But i was just asking for a little response from her because i want her to have a shoulder to be leaned. I know I'm stupid for unfollowing her socials but it's because i thought I was ghosted and thrown in the dark, like I don't know what to do and i waited a week before doing that thing, and i was impatient.

      "content": "I (20M) and I’ve been friends with the same small group (20M and 22M) for around ten years. We had a short falling-out at one point but eventually patched things up.\n\nAbout a year ago, I introduced my girlfriend (20F) to the group. She didn’t have many close friends and would sometimes get upset when I spent time with mine, so I thought including her would help her feel more connected. Since she’s not working right now and I am, she’s had more free time and ended up spending a lot more time with them than I have.\n\nLast year, weed was legalized in our state, and now most of their hangouts involve smoking. I don’t smoke, so I usually skip those gatherings. Over time, it feels like they stopped inviting me altogether when weed is involved which is most of the time now. I honestly don’t mind that, but what’s been bothering me is that most group chats and plans now go through her. I feel more and more like an outsider in the same group I brought her into.\n\nShe also tends to share things about me with them not anything super personal, but enough that I feel like I’m being talked about without actually being part of the conversation. I don’t get direct invites anymore either. They’ll text her, and she’ll pass it on to me. It makes it hard to tell whether I’m actually wanted there or just being looped in because she feels I should be. That uncertainty has made me pull away.\n\nA recent example we were gaming online, and someone suggested she join. I said I didn’t have the game installed on my other PC, and she hit me with a quick “OK” that felt a little passive-aggressive. When I asked her about it, she said she “just wanted to be included.” Meanwhile, she’s been included for months I've been the one left out.\n\nNot long after that, one of my friends sent me a comic about weed and friendship ([this one](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJshfxnxWPg/?img_index=1&igsh=MWY5NjZybXh3MXgwdg==)). I assume someone told him why I haven’t been around much. He didn’t say anything just sent the post. It came across like he was trying to guilt me or explain something I already understand. I’ve told them why I don’t smoke, and I know why people and why they do it’s not a mystery to me, and I didn’t need a cartoon about it.\n\nWhen we do go out together, it’s usually because she wants me to be there or they persuaded me . I end up covering all the expenses for her. They'll start to smoke, and I’m left alone, wondering why I’m even here if this was the plan the whole time.\n\nAll of this has me reflecting on my friendships in general. It feels like the only reason I’m still in the group is because we’ve known each other so long. The connection doesn’t feel active anymore more like a memory we are still trying to keep alive.\n\nThe turning point for me was tonight. She left my place around 9 p.m. and took a long bus ride about 11 miles, over an hour just to smoke with them. A few months ago, she was too anxious to walk to a nearby store at night, but now she’s making long trips to smoke and be “included.” It really made me realize how far out of sync I feel with both her and the group.\n\nHow do I even start figuring out what to do here? I feel like I’ve lost my place in both my relationship and my friend group. What’s the best way to talk to my girlfriend about how I’m feeling without her brushing it off or turning it around on me? And when it comes to my friends, how do I know if it’s worth trying to reconnect, or if I’m better off letting go and finding new people who actually get me?\n\n**TL;DR:**  \nI \\[21M\\] introduced my girlfriend \\[20F\\] to my friend group of 10 years. Since then, she’s gotten closer to them than I am. They all smoke weed (I don’t), and I feel left out of plans, conversations, and connection, and tonight she took a long bus ride just to go smoke with them. I feel like a stranger in my own group . How do I even start figuring out what to do here? I feel like I’ve lost my place in both my relationship and my friend group. What’s the best way to talk to my girlfriend about how I’m feeling without her brushing it off or turning it around on me? And when it comes to my friends, how do I know if it’s worth trying to reconnect, or if I’m better off letting go and finding new people who actually get me?",

      "title": "I (18M) feel discontent in my relationship with my girlfriend (19F) I need advice?",
      "content": "I met my girlfriend (let’s call her Stephanie) at an event. We started talking, clicked, and began dating. I thought she was really pretty, sweet, and funny. It felt great at first.\n\nIt’s been a couple of months now… and I’m starting to feel really unhappy.\n\nIt feels like things moved too fast. There are a lot of small and big things that are bothering me, and it’s starting to weigh me down. Here are some examples:\n\nShe doesn’t have a car, so I always pick her up and drop her off. I didn’t mind at first, but she demands I pick her up super early in the morning for dates, and then gets angry if I’m late even though I’m scrambling to get ready myself. \n\nI’m a relatively new driver, and I’m not comfortable driving on highways yet. We live in a small town, and the nearest city is an hour away. She gets mad that I don’t want to drive that far.\n\nShe constantly wants to go out and do stuff, which I don’t always mind. But I need time to recharge alone at home and she doesn’t seem to get or respect that.\n\nSometimes she says things that seem like jokes, but they still hurt. Example: I once called her picky, and she replied, “If I’m so picky, why am I dating you?” Or she’ll tell me to “shut up” if I say something she doesn’t like.  I’ve talked to her about it, and she brushed it off, saying, “I’m not used to a sensitive guy, the men in my family aren’t like that.” But I don’t think it’s being sensitive to not want to be insulted by your partner.\n\nI feel like she often overreacts or takes everything negative. One time, we were gonna hangout after I got off work and she was going to get dropped off an hour early and just wait in my car. I suggested she get dropped off near a coffee shop instead, so she wouldn’t overheat. She got mad and told me to “calm down,” even though I was just trying to be thoughtful. Another example: We were taking pictures, and when I asked, “Good?” and she said yes, I assumed we were done. When I started walking away, she got furious that I didn’t want to take more despite her saying we were good.\n\nI feel like I’m putting in more effort emotionally and physically sometimes. On one of our anniversary, I gave her flowers, a card, and her favorite candy. She gave me… 25 cents. In conversations, I ask about her day, her interests, her mood but she rarely asks me anything back. Calls are silent unless I keep the convo alive. Example: She went shopping with her friend. I asked what she did, she said, “Went shopping, got home.” I asked, “What store?” and she said “idk.”\n\nWe have met each other’s families, pets, friends, everyone knows we’re together. And I feel like I have to lie to them when they ask about my relationship because I don’t want them to think things are bad. My parents ask if I’m excited to see her and I have to lie. The truth is, I dread it because I know it’s going to be draining.\n\nI feel like we had rushed beginnings, and it hasn’t slowed down. Within the first month, she said “I love you,” and wanted me to meet her parents. I said it back in a panic, and after that, I felt like it was too late to ask to slow things down. I wanted to, but I felt stuck already.\n\nI have tried to communicate, I know communication is very important. I’ve made it a priority. Everything I’ve written here, I’ve already told her in real conversations. There’s been little to no change. She listens, then goes right back to the same behavior.\n\nI know some people might say, “Just break up.” But it’s not that simple for me. We’ve had good times. She does do sweet things occasionally like making little crafts or being considerate when I’m overwhelmed. It’s not all bad, and I don’t want to just throw that away.\n\nBut honestly, I feel exhausted. Like I’m constantly giving, constantly explaining, constantly trying to prevent fights… and nothing gets better. I feel like I’ll collapse if something doesn’t change soon.\n\nI keep thinking: Maybe if I’m just a better boyfriend, she’ll treat me better. Or: Maybe if I tell her what’s bothering me one more time, she’ll finally understand. But I’ve already tried. And I’m still tired and unhappy.\n\nIf I Did Break Up… Then What? How do I even do it All our friends know we’re dating. Our families ask about us constantly. It feels like we’ve shared too much.\n\nOn top of that, she’s moving out of the country for college next year. So it feels like this will end anyway… but I don’t know how to make the call now.\n\nAdvice Welcome\n\nI’m stuck in a place where I don’t want to give up, but I also don’t want to keep feeling this way. I’ve communicated. I’ve tried. But I’m still drained.",

      "content": "some back story, my ex and I dated when we were both 18 fresh out of highschool for about two months, we both lost our virginity to each other, and we both cannot remember why we broke up in the first place. years of no contact and I decide to hit him up. we immediately make plans to meet up and skip the small talk via text. luckily he was in town so we set up a date for the next day and then another date, and then a third. \n\nwe've been talking about the important things like where we see ourselves in five years, kids, marriage, etc. our values match up and we've been enjoying our time together lately. only thing is, he lives about three hours away, so this would ultimately be a long distance relationship if we decide to pursue it. \n\nI asked him what his intentions are and he says he intends to be with me, and I would love to be with him as well. I guess I'm just looking for any advice on how to navigate a semi long distance relationship. we said we can always meet in the middle, or meet when he's in town visiting family. \n\nas of right now we haven't put a label on us, but I would like to. I'm just not sure if it would be moving too quickly since we've only gone out three times so far, and I'm not sure when I'll be able to see him again next. I do know he'll be back in August and sometime before then as well, so it wouldn't be too long. now all I'm trying to figure out is if I should wait until he comes back to make things official, or have a conversation over the phone with him :)\n\nthank you!!

      "content": "Sorry if it's long, I am in a difficult situation here that unlike other times is draining me and is longer in time, scope and consequences. I am writing this and going to show it to her because she keeps on asking chatgpt and it just makes her mad enforcing her feelings.\n\nDuring our 12 years relationship, wife always had issues ignoring annoying behaviors and can get triggered very easy, it was so severe at one time that she thought that a group of nurses are a gang and are following her and spying on her, but then every time i support and help and mostly she ll just leave the situation like in the hospital she stopped caring for her father and came back home, or at work she ll just resign and we ll live on my income and savings for a while \n\nNow the issue with my mother is that she came to visit for the birth of my niece, she was planning to stay for a week or 2 before she goes and stays with my sister, she visits once a year and last year she didn't stay with us because my wife said she can't handle her drama (after pregnancy)...\nafter few days of her coming my wife started to tell me about certain behaviors my mom did and how they annoyed her and made her feel uncomfortable, to me it's nothing out of the ordinary from my narcissistic mom, she always was a control freak and always made funny faces and always behaved in different ways with different people, but this visit, my wife started to notice all of that and is convinced that it just started, i didn't dismiss her experience or feelings i tried to be calm and wait it out, her emotions started boiling until the day she made a huge scene, i packed my mother and sent her to my sister early, my wife wants an apology and can't  stop feeling hurt, she thinks i am not supportive and that i am defending my mother, she is using the history of abuse that i shared with her to convince me that my mother shouldn't be part of our family in any ways or sort, i feel i am getting abused all over again and that getting grades and behaving will never be enough , she wants me to get an apology for her while i can't even get one from my mom for myself (she asked me do you want to get revenge now that you are strong) ...\n\ni love my wife but now we have a baby, if we cut my mother off, when is this going to stop, our sons teacher or fiance or inlaws ? If for 2 weeks she can't ignore my mom mixing her clothes in our laundry, or pushing tap handle to the left when my wife puts it to the right ... how can she navigate the world with a baby, i understand that she can't help feeling what she feels, but does that shield her from abusing me and saying mean things, this is 4 weeks of daily mood swings, when i finish work i feel like am going to hell, i lost my sh** 2 days ago and fractured my hand... One day she hears reason and she is sweet and loving and apologies for her abusive words, the next day she is totally a different person talking again about how my mom wronged her and how i didn't protect her and how our marriage is damaged.\n\nI'v been always a supportive husband, she is a stay at home mom, i provide everything, i wake up 5AM and come back 4PM and help with the baby sometimes until 10 or 12, i always carry the baby outside (she has small hands) if there is no food i order deliveries and never complain, all i want if for her to recognize the main issue and fix it not hang everything on my mom who's not even present with us for 4 weeks now.\n\nShe is going to read and we are going to get an official diagnosis with a professional (she is resisting and thinking i am gaslighting her to put the blame on her this time)",

We never broke no contact and after less than one month we were back together.\n\nDuring that time off I texted that other ex to check her availability, but it never got to anywhere, we ended up stopping the convo again. After I got back together with my current girl, she did text me again and I casually replied without any intention/feeling but ended up dry replying to finish up the convo. Now, this is where I believe I made a mistake: about a week after the convo had died I saw something that really reminded me of an inside joke we had and sent it to her (a video). We exchanged a couple texts about it, and then next day she texted me \"good morning\" and I ignored it. She then texted me \"how are you?\" several hours later which I ignored as well.\n\nMaybe I'm over-analyzing this, but can me reigniting that conversation be considered as cheating?\n\nI feel like my anxious mind is now constantly sending me intrusive thoughts that everything is gonna go wrong because of what I did, even though I know it's highly unlikely and irrational, but the better things seem to be going, the more irrational fear pops up in my mind.

      "title": "M33 F29 not sure how to move forward",
      "content": "I met a girl in September. We’ll call her Beth. We immediately hit it off. At that time she was married but in an open relationship. The chemistry was outstanding from day one and the sex was even better. Soon after we met her husband asked for a divorce. We continued to see each other. Trying polyamory, she met a second guy about two weeks after meeting me. she fell for him hard but we continued our thing- getting more intense. But I had doubts- she was fresh from a marriage and I had a lot of baggage from my own divorce- what future could we have? Given we both have ADHD I was very worried about limerence. We kept at this until November. At that time she asked to slow things down. So we slowed things down. It continued that we would talk every day and we kept hanging out- everything felt good except that I could tell she was more interested in the other partner even if she was spending more time with me (just sort of a vibe thing on my end). Fast forward to March. We are approaching our 6 month mark when she suddenly pulls away and drastically reduces how much she is texting me for about a week. In that time she takes a trip with the other guy. This is the same time that she her ex husband is moving out and started the court process. After she gets back she says that we should just be FWB because she doesn’t know about a romantic future because of compatibility issues. Most of those revolve around living together and aren’t dealbreakers to me. So we reduce to “just” fwb. Two weeks later the other guy (who she seemed to want a monogamous relationship with) broke up with her to pursue his favored partner. Nothing changed in the meantime of how much time we were texting and spending time together. This fwb situation continued until late April. She started talking with this other guy and said she was now seeking monogamy. I told her even if I didn’t feel I was poly, I couldn’t offer monogamy at this time because of the yo-yo behavior she displayed. We kept talking and hanging out just the same as we were before. It became clear though that fwb wasn’t working. We met “one last time” to talk post mortem on our relationship.l and to discuss the future. We had sex “one last time.”  It was amazing. In the morning she called it making love- which is not a phrase we had ever used. In our postmortem discussion she said part of the reason she pulled back is that things didn’t seem to be progressing past having fun, and that she was looking for something more between us. I had felt like there was more. I wanted to tell her I love her multiple times, but given past experiences I was very hesitant to say it too soon.  Given that this is a post mortem I’m honest and tell her I wanted to say it but it either never felt right or the right time. She told me that if I had she would have reciprocated. We had an amazing night together but said that after this it should just be friends. Side note on that- I feel she is meant to be part of my life romantically or platonically in some manner. I think given enough time I could do just friends if that’s the only option (I genuinely feel she is meant to be a long term part of my life in some way). We hang out a few days later as just friends. We end up cuddling while watching tv. She at one point starts stroking my arm in the same way she did while we weren’t “just friends.”  This feels too much like it did before. I ruminate on it for about a week (also adopt a cat which may have been a reaction to the “breakup”).  On Friday- about three weeks ago- I send her a message telling her I love her and that while I think we can be friends, we can’t keep doing things the way we are and that I need some no contact space. This was in the middle of the night like an asshole. The next day I send another message apologizing for sending that all at once in the middle of the night, but reiterating my need for no contact. We have a call and discuss things but do agree to no contact. For a week I miss her terribly, but I stay strong and don’t reach out. About a week in to no contact she responds to one of my snap stories. I debated replying but ultimately did respond. We had a conversation for a while- it was just habit to fall back to talking to her consistently- but at a certain point she didn’t reply back and I didn’t push it. That was about two weeks ago. I remain strong in not being the person who reaches out, but goddamn do I miss her. I’ve done stints of sobriety that were easier. When we had our last phone conversation she asked if I wanted a long term monogamous relationship. Something she thought I was fundamentally opposed to. I told her given the circumstances I couldn’t really answer that. I had to protect myself from being on a yo-yo. We agreed on giving each other space for now but would like to come to a friendship IF possible. Like I said before, after a week she responds to my snap story with something innocuous and we talked for a bit until she stopped responding. This, like when we were dating is a mismatch of what she is saying vs how she is acting because she consistently acts like we have something real between us. After a lot of contemplating and shadow work- I came to the conclusion that yes I do want a monogamous long term relationship with her. Boundaries will need to be set, but I see a way in which this works. At the same time she hasn’t viewed or interacted with anything I’ve posted since. I’m not sure if this is her respecting my space or because she has someone new (idk). In this time all I’ve really done is miss her. I wake up and I’m thinking of her. I see a video or meme and I think I should send it to her. I hung out with another woman and all I could think about is how I’d rather be with Beth right now. I think of so many things I want to share with her. I want to tell her all this but I’m also worried she is now seeing that guy she was talking with before we “split.” The people I’ve talked to all say just go for it and tell her how I feel and what I want. But I am so worried that things aren’t going to go the way I want and I’m not sure if I should take her at her word or to believe her by her actions- and her actions (and rereading nine mothers of conversation) all seem to say she wants something with me but pulls away when things get too close. And right now I’m at a loss at what to do next. \n",

Made sleepovers and talked deeply. We clicked. And he is such a wonderful and kind human. But then I came into a relationship and he confessed that he had developed feelings for me. At that time I was sad that he hadn't told me earlier. While it's hard for me to have romantic feelings, I liked him and I wouldn't have said no.\n\nDuring that relationship he distanced himself from me more and more. But everytime I saw him I had funny feelings. Sadness but sometimes also something like longing. \n\nNow we barely see eachother and I am very sad about that. We write from time to time and see each other once or twice a month.\n\nThen I broke up with my LDR. By that time he was in a relationship. And I am happy for him.

And I wonder if I am just fleeing whenever I know that my relationship got problems that ain't solvebel or if I have feelings for him or if I am just peojecting something.\n\nI am writting this after having a very intensive dream in which we reconnect and talk about it all. We even cuddle there and I feel so bad about that. I am still in a relationship. So my feelings are all over the place.\n\nWhat's going on with me?",

      "content": "TLDR: bf is adamant in going to grad school even if it will land him ~100k in debt (not including the interest payments). Is this grounds for an ultimatum?\n\nI’m going to try to make this as readable as possible:\n\nTHE RELATIONSHIP: I (24F) and my bf (26M) have been together for 3 years. He is incredibly loving, kind, and most of our life goals align. We are in the same field. \n\nMY FINANCIAL SITUATION: I have 0 debt/student loans thankfully to my parents and scholarships. I am doing my masters, which would have also costed 100k, but I received a full scholarship which justified it for me. In both of our fields, the masters is basically a cash grab. A higher salary of maybe 5-15 k annually is expected but it is not a transformative or completely necessary masters. I have some part time work but am basically a full time student so my annual salary is like 10k. Getting a job after graduating and hoping to land something in the 85-100 k range. \n\nBF’S FINANCIAL SITUATION: Bf was not upfront with his student loans but it seems (he is still keeping it vague) he has 50 - 60k from undergrad and now wants to do his masters. He did not receive any scholarship so he will be hit with 100k of student loans. He currently makes ~80k.\nHis family is also in debt and he does not know how much. His parents have offered to help but I realistically can’t see how they can help without taking on even more debt. \n\nOUR ARGUMENT: I was really upfront that I think the masters is a terrible idea. BF only applied to a very small amount so he has no choices or leverage with other programs. He also didn’t put as much as he could to be competitive for scholarships. Bf is almost dead set on the masters, partly due to his fears that he could be fired from his job soon (layoffs) and his family is also pro-masters. \nI have been honest and told him if he goes ahead with it I am afraid I will feel resentment for him in the future when we have a kid, other big expenses, etc. he was really upset but is still basically set on it. \n\nDILEMMA: currently, he has paid a few hundred dollars of deposit for his program so it is still technically possible to drop out. He also recently felt a lot of doubt about it but still seems like he wants to power ahead. I told him he has his whole life to apply to grad school and that there is no rush because he is still young. \nI feel more and more that this is a dealbreaker for me. \n\nQUESTIONS: I am wondering if this is fair to want to break up with him. I also don’t know if I should tell him this or wait for him to make his own decision. \n\nThank you!! ",

Total emotional manipulation. And to make things worse, her parents are weirdly invested in the relationship they like the guy, and they’ve made it clear they don’t want her to end it. She’s being pulled from all directions, and she’s tired.\n\nShe’s planning to move abroad soon (she's applying to Australia), and I can tell she’s craving freedom and a fresh start.

He is going to therapy now because of it. His family is perfect, parents still together and he has no mental issues but really bad anxiety.\n\nHe claims the only reason he can’t propose is because I haven’t graduated yet. But for the longest time I was only taking 2 classes because that’s all I could afford without taking out a loan because I want to avoid debt and my parents can’t afford to help me. \n\nHis parents supported him throughout his entire college experience so he was able to graduate in 4 years.\n\nI am upset because if that is truly the reason then I don’t think I want to be with someone who doesn’t want to be with me because I haven’t graduated??? I have my associates but I get my bachelors in a year and that just seems very conditional to me. I would be with him even if he never graduated. Also I have a really good job right now that pays well so I have a feeling there is something else?\n\nHe says our relationship means everything to him and it’s his top priority but can’t propose after 9 years.

      "content": "My boyfriend (24M) and I (24F) have been together for 6 years. This is our second time dating - we dated as teens, he cheated on me and we broke up. We got back together a few years later and I genuinely saw him as a changed man. There was issues in the beginning with him still being in contact with his ex (the girl he cheated with), but pretty much smooth sailing since the very early months of dating.\n\nFlash forward to a few weeks ago, I found a bobby pin on the floor of his bathroom. (He still lives at home but he has his own bathroom attached to his room) A few days later we took a one night trip, a getaway I booked us for our anniversary. It was a Saturday when we were driving up, and he was soooo tired. I asked him why, he said he was up until 5am washing cars because he took a nap after work and put it off until late. (This is not unlike him, I’ve seen it myself). On Sunday when we were driving home, I asked him about it again because I had a weird feeling about his story. This time he said he washed the cars right after work, then took a nap and woke up at 1 am, unable to fall back asleep until 4am.\n\nThen a week later, he buys me flowers. I don’t mean to sound crazy, but this is very unusual for him. He has bought me flowers maybe 2 other times our whole relationship. It was our anniversary the week before and he didn’t even get me flowers then.\n\nI’m not on birth control so we use condoms. Ever since the bobby pin incident, I’ve been keeping track of the amount of condoms he has. He has a string or line of them attached in a row in his drawer. (Idk how to explain that but you know what I mean). First time it was at 7. We used one, next time I came over, it was at 5. We used one and then next time I came over it was still at 5. Last night, there was only one left. I checked the box he has and it was empty as well. It was one of those huge Costco boxes and he got it less than two months prior. We have sex maybe twice a week.\n\nI have a huge gut feeling that something is going on. He has been acting different and it’s eating me alive not being able to just know what’s going on. The lengths he went to when we were teens shows me how good he is at covering these things up. He’s also a very very good liar, type of guy who randomly lies for no good reason. I know he would never admit to it, so how can I find out the truth? I hope to god it’s not true but if it is I need concrete evidence to be able to walk away. I know I sound crazy but I am asking if anyone has had any luck with specific ways of finding out their partner was cheating. I’m going to go through his phone when I see him but since I expressed my suspicions, it will be cleared out. Where else can I look in his phone that he won’t think to clear?\n\nIf you’ve been in a similar situation and walked away without getting concrete evidence, what was the moment that confirmed that for you? How do you have that closure without proof?\n\ntl;dr: I think my boyfriend of 6 years is cheating on me based on a suspicious serious of events. How do I find out the truth or move on from the situation if I can’t uncover it?",

My wife had a really hard pregnancy and deep down I knew it, but seeing her in pain and not being herself made me shut down and distance myself. I know I fucked up. I tried my best to do what I could to help around the house like making sure bills were paid, cleaning, cooking, doing the laundry but some days those tasks was overwhelming and really daunting. My wife was super exhausted and I know I shouldn’t have asked for help, but I did and if I could go back in time, I would tell myself to suck it up and do better.\n\nFast forward to now, our son is born and he is one month. I have been doing all the household things because my wife’s only job is to take care of our baby. I get up with the baby to change him before handing him to my wife, I burp him after so that she can go to sleep right away. I feel like I’m doing everything I can to take care of everyone. My only ask from my wife was to acknowledge that I was doing all this work to help out. Now I’m not doing this because I need her to see that I’m doing it and I’m not asking for acknowledgement because it’ll be the only way I’ll do things, but I love words of affirmation and I seek external validation a lot. My wife feels like she shouldn’t have to say thank you to me because this is part of being an adult and I truly get that yet I’m still struggling to let that go. She feels as if I am not ready to grow up and be an adult just yet because I want to spend an hour everyday playing video games. (I barely have been able to play since the baby got here and have asked that I can get some time to relax and of course I would give her that time too if she wanted it).\n\nI want to fix our relationship and I expressed this to her and she says that right now her only priority is our son. I know this is going to take time, but I’m scared that she already has made up her mind and doesn’t want to fix it.  She is my best friend and whole world and she has given me the most beautiful baby boy ever. And I want to do everything in my power to fix this.\n\nHow can I help us start moving towards fixing our relationship?\n\nAdding: We agreed to meet with a couples therapist but at the last minute, my wife wanted to reschedule because she doesn’t have answers to the questions that will be asked.\n\nETA: we both are in individual therapy already. My therapy focuses a lot on my childhood trauma and hers with her anxiety. \n\nAlso, we are two women! We conceived via donor sperm and she carried. ",

He's gotten better significantly since then thankfully, though still tends to make comments about feeling unloved. I completely understand why he feels this way, we went from being very intimate to nothing. I've tried everything, from talking to him multiple times about my feelings, therapy and now we're going to see a couples therapist in 2 days. I just can't shake it.

      "content": "Long story short, I’ve been dating my gf for a while, we’ve been high school sweethearts. During my senior summer we had some rough patches where I broke up with her because we were going to colleges in different states and didn’t know if long distance was going to work. We ended up getting back together and working somewhat but things haven’t been perfect.\n\nThings at points have gotten toxic as I might transfer farther away and she talked about not liking that. It’s my dream and I would do it regardless but it’s been a topic of discussion that doesn’t usually end well.\n\nThe thing that has me torn is that we’re currently doing long distance as I’m on the road. The feelings I’ve had are different because when I’m not with her I don’t often think about her and even think about if getting back together was the right move. But when I’m with her I feel happy and in love. It’s very bipolar and I’m not sure what to feel. While on the road I kept seeing this other girl who was constantly looking at me. On 3 separate days we were constantly looking at each other and I actually started blushing, the first time I felt something in years.\n\nI’m not saying I should break up with my gf for this woman but I’m confused if I should stay with her in general. Having these feelings and writing this post already makes me feel like that’s bad enough but when I’m with her things feel good again. I’m not sure if I’m feeling discomfort since she has been my only gf and all I’ve known for years or if we really have something special.\n\nIs breaking up with my girlfriend the right choice?",

      "content": "My girlfriend and I have been in a relationship for 3 years and recently it seems that we just argue about everything. She tells me she wants to have more alone time but I’m just leached on to her for some reason. When she told me that, I told myself that I would give her more space to herself but it seems that we argue about any small thing that happens between us and when we argue, it doesn’t end until one of us gives up and apologizes. Recently tho she did something that got me really upset. Like what I said before was just some context about us two but this is the real issue/problem and I don’t really know how to deal with it or what to do. I picked her up from work and took her to her place and then she asked me if I wanted to go to prom with her since we didn’t go when I was still in Highschool. She told me we should and have some fun together and I was like alright fine let’s go to prom together. All this happened like 2 months before prom, a week after that conversation that we had she went a bought a $600 dollar dress. She kept on telling me how she wanted to look all pretty and surprise me when I saw her because she didn’t want to show me pictures of the dress or see how she looks in it which I have no problem with cause I understand. Time flies by and she waits till 5 days before prom to tell me that she never bought the tickets and she has to talk to the principal wether I can go or not since I’m an outsider and no longer a student at that school anymore. We talked about ‘what if’ we can’t go to prom and I reassured her that everything was going to be fine and if we can’t we’ll just go do something else that do and I would make it up to her. \n\nOn the 4th day she goes to the principal to talk to him and she said “he can’t let u go bc he alrdy finished the list for outside guests, so now the only other people who can go are students” and then I asked “are you going to go?” And she responded to idk. She said that she wanted to experience prom but how she felt like she was going to be alone and sad. After all of that she mentioned that she was going to be her friend’s 18F guest and would probably go, which absolutely shattered me because she asked ME to go and out of nowhere she already had me replaced and didn’t even apologize for getting my hopes up, buying the tickets on time, and replacing me like that or even asked how I felt about her going to prom. I would’ve been fine with it but it’s just the fact that she did all this which makes me feel like she doesn’t even care about me. Recently I’ve been texting her really dry because I don’t really want to talk to her after all of this and prom is just lurking around the corner and honestly I don’t know how to intake all of this. I was thinking about telling her how I felt after prom because I didn’t want to do it before so she wouldn’t change her mind on going or not. The day after prom I was thinking about breaking up with her because of this and idk if I should or not. \n\nThoughts?\n\nThank you for reading this and giving me your thoughts, I appreciate it.",

      "title": "I (22F) feel like it may be time to let go of my boyfriend (22M), but I'm afraid to. Any advice?",
      "content": "I have been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years. We broke up for a few months halfway through, but I would say we've been pretty healthy and have grown since we got back together.\n\nFor the past year or so, I've been having trouble deciding what I truly want. Ever since an incident that happened with my sister last year, I've started to become afraid of death and the idea of it. I began to really realize that we only get one chance at life and because of these thoughts, I started to have a strong desire to want to live whatever's left of my youth before settling in and having children. I feel like once I do have children, that's another chapter in my life and I would basically have to sacrifice myself and my time to take care of them. Last year, I brought this issue up with him and I felt like maybe I was restricting myself from having new experiences and meeting new people due to being in a relationship. He reassured me saying \"if you think the grass is greener on the other side, I'll give you greener grass. If you want to meet new people, I'll pretend to approach you for the first time at a bar\" and etc. At that time, I was really touched by his dedication and he reassured that it's normal to feel fomo in a long term relationship and that he would allow me to live my life to the fullest and go out with friends and have fun. We were eager to make things work and I also started to think \"well, I guess I can't experience everything I want in life and that's okay\".\n\nFast forward to the present time, and I feel like nothing was done in the relationship. I think at some point we got too comfortable and I eventually lost passion without realizing. We would meet up once a week and because I was busy sometimes, we would basically just co-exist during the one day we meet while I try to do work. I began showing less affection and sometimes I just wasn't feeling it either. Whenever we did hang out and do something fun or have the opportunity to talk about random things, I would genuinely enjoy my time but those days were scarce. I think both me and my boyfriend are aware that maybe meeting more often would help the relationship, but our schedules would always conflict or we wouldn't know what to do when we did have free time. Despite my boyfriend telling me he'd help me feel satisfied with the relationship and would allow me to live my life, he started to become more needy for reassurance. He'd be scared that I would lose my spark for him again and would be quite insecure whenever I hung out with my friends of the opposite sex. Of course his feelings are valid and I wish I could help him with them, but I end up feeling annoyed instead because I feel like it's getting in the way of my \"peace\" and desire to freely live my life. I understand that if I am willing to make the relationship work while still living my life, I need to consider his feelings and basically be a girlfriend, but these days I've just been having trouble with it. When he asks for reassurance, I wonder what else I'm supposed to do other than say I love you. When he feels insecure, I just feel like it's getting in the way of my life. Just like last year, I still feel like the relationship is restricting me from having new experiences or meeting new people. I'm not trying to join the \"hook-up culture\" or anything, but I want to at least be close friends with the opposite sex without having to worry about my boyfriend. I spoke to him recently about this issue and instead of giving up, he still wants to work things through. I can't help but think that maybe we've already tried our best or that this issue would come up again in the future. I'm also afraid that I would build resentment for him in the future if I don't get to live a \"fulfilling youth\". I know it sounds horrible and we're probably better off just ending things, but I'm afraid to let go.\n\nBesides the issues that we have, I'm afraid to let go of my partner. I'm afraid I would never meet anyone who would love me as much as he does. I'm afraid that if I do leave him to \"live my life\", I would never find someone else who would be as dedicated and loyal as he is. I'm afraid that when I do become single, no one would care for me anymore. I'm afraid I'd regret my decision to break things off and I will forever think about him. There is only one of him and I would never have that anymore. Throughout our relationship, we learned a lot from each other and basically grew together. The cons probably outweigh the pros and based on what I've written, it would be better to break things off to avoid resentment and to allow him to find someone better, but I'm still afraid to let go. I'm unsure what advice could be given at this point, but if anyone has anything please let me know.\n\nTLDR: I've been with my boyfriend for almost 5 years, and although we've had a healthy relationship, lately I've been struggling with the desire to live my youth fully before settling down and having kids. I fear that staying in the relationship is limiting my experiences, and I feel frustrated by his increasing need for reassurance and insecurity especially when I hang out with friends of the opposite sex. Despite us trying to work through it, I'm afraid these issues would continue reoccuring. I’m afraid to let go because I fear I'll never find someone as dedicated or loving as he is, but I also worry that staying might lead to resentment. I'm torn between wanting to live my life freely and the fear of losing him.",

After waking up, when we eat, before going to sleep bla bla all the time. So I’m afraid when we live together he will stop appreciate me? \n\n+ (the last one, bear with me) we are both very antisocial, so I am 100% sure he will only spend time with me and not any other person.

Waited a few days to tell my girlfriend so that I could think about it and because I didn’t want to make it a big thing and now girlfriend is mad at me and I’m not sure what to do. No interest in ex, I love my girlfriend.\n\ni ran into my ex at a party Friday night. for context my ex has borderline personality disorder and I haven’t seen her since we broke up in September 2023. Our relationship ended very chaotic and I carried a lot of baggage from that for a long time. I originally wasn’t going to say anything to her, but I heard that she was anxious that I was there and basically she asked me if I wanted to go outside and talk and clear the air on a lot of things.\n\nI told her straight up when the conversation started that I don’t want to be friends and that i have a girlfriend, and she said she doesn’t expect that and she just wants me to be happy. I basically just tried to tell her that she hurt me and how she did and she practically just avoided all accountability and just turned it back on me so I gave up. She says that my girlfriend is so pretty and she hopes I keep her, and then turns around and begins to confess her love to me and basically says that she still hopes that someday we get the timing right, even though we’re both in relationships. I should’ve just walked away at that point, but I was honestly just shocked that she was even saying all that to me. I literally couldn’t believe it. Eventually, we decide that we’ve said all that we have to say and I tell her that I probably am not going to speak to her again after this.\n\nWhen I wake up the next day, I see that she ended up texting me before we actually talked at the party, saying that everything was good on her end. I didn’t see it because I have her contact deleted and her number muted. We were both intoxicated when we were talking so I felt like I came off in a more hostile way, so I just said that I’m sorry for being bitter the night before and said that I’m proud that she’s come so far and seems happy now and I hope she keeps going, and I’ll always appreciate what I learned from her. You can see the text messages through the dropbox link I left them in here. After the conversation ended, I blocked her and deleted the texts.\n\nI didn’t tell my current girlfriend at first because I didn’t really want it to be a big issue or a thing and I honestly needed to sit and unpack and think about it for a little bit. It’s not that i care about my ex-girlfriend I was honestly just hurt that she would still avoid accountability and felt disrespected that she would tell me all of those things that she feels towards me even after knowing we’re both in a relationship. I didn’t wanna bring it up and upset my current girlfriend who I’m so happy with and give her the wrong idea and make her insecure. The last thing I wanted was for my ex-girlfriend to cause me problems in my current relationship. I should’ve just told my gf as soon as it happened, but I honestly didn’t even want to give it power because until my ex made it a point to ask to talk at the party, I wasn’t even gonna speak to her like that. I thought that we had both been so far past it.\n\nI told my current girlfriend today and she got very mad at me what hurt and disappointed her more than anything was that I waited to tell her but also that I texted my ex the next day. She says she doesn’t understand why I care if she’s good or not or why I had to wish her well. she asked for screenshots of the text I sent her and I sent them the ones that I posted above and she basically told me to go fuck myself. She said that I might as well have told my ex that I miss her and that the door is open and for her to come over, but I genuinely was just trying to close the door and put an end to it in a healthy way. I thought that it was important for me to wish them well and let go of ever hoping for accountability from them or understanding of what I went through. she specifically cited the “you’re gonna shine so bright and be so happy” lies as me practically saying that I miss my ex and that she should come over. I probably should’ve cut the conversation shorter and kept it just to one paragraph but I genuinely just wanted to leave things off on a positive note and leave them with something encouraging instead of being negative and hurt. she says that I didn’t have to wish them well or feel resentful towards them and I could’ve just let it go.\n\nmy cats are at my girlfriend‘s apartment and she wants me to go tomorrow to pick them up. She agreed to sit in and talk about it in my online therapy class tomorrow, but after that, I believe she wants me to come back home. I apologized and made it very clear that I didn’t intend to hurt her or make her feel like I was doing something suspicious, and that I understand where she’s coming from. I reiterated that I don’t feel anything for my ex anymore romantically and I just wanted to wish them well despite the negative feelings because I thought that was the healthiest thing to do. I feel like an asshole and so stupid. I’ve worked so hard to be better and to change to be a more mature, grown person, for myself and for the relationship that I have now. part of me feels that she’s just very angry right now and her tone will change once she cools down, but I’m also so scared that she’s done with me and I completely messed this up when I was just trying to do the right thing. I genuinely didn’t have any ulterior motives when I texted her. I just didn’t wanna be remembered as a dick or bitter and angry about something that happened so long ago. She doesn’t wanna speak to me now, and I’m giving her space. please give me your thoughts. Do you think things will get better when she cools down? How can I handle this better?\n\nEDIT: i’m a dumbass and forgot to scribble out the phone number, it completely slipped my\nmind. apologies mods.",

      "content": "Sometimes I feel like my boyfriend lies about so many things when he’s talking to me. Nothing huge, just silly little things, and I find it hard to believe him whenever he’s telling me a story or talking to me, due to the amount of insane details or things that I know he’s making up. Sometimes I think that he says these things to make himself either sound more interesting, or to may be relate to me more? \n\nFor example, anytime I tell him a story about my friends and I he will immediately come back with “ yeah I went through the same thing with one of my friends…” and then he will tell a story that is almost similar to mine. However, he has told so many stories about the same friends that he keeps bringing up in none of them aligned with each other and sometimes they just don’t make sense. He’s told me before that he went on vacation to Florida, and then told me a whole story about it- only to find out from his family that he has never been to Florida. \n\nHe will lie about the prices of things, he has told me stories about how him and his grandma used to make cakes together when the kids were younger, however, I later found out from his grandma that she never baked with the kids. He also has lied about places he has lived in, he has been late to things many times and claims that he was “stuck in traffic,” even though I know that’s not true because he has his location on and I can see that he is still at home to even 20 minutes after he tells me he’s on his way. \n\nSometimes I wonder if I am overthinking this because it’s not like he’s lying to be intentionally harmful or deceitful. He hasn’t cheated on me and he hasn’t done anything to blatantly disrespect our relationship. However, it has got gotten into a point with these little lies that I can barely listen to him tell a story or have a conversation with him without questioning it or questioning whether it is true. \n\nAnd before you ask: yes, I have made comments about this. Sometimes in the moment like “ I don’t think that’s completely true” or “are you sure?” \n\n\n\n",

I work out of town a lot and this spring was very busy for my work so I've been gone a lot February till end of June I'm supposed to be home and off for the summer. I get to go home every so often for a few days but it's really not enough. My wife is a stay at home mom.\n\nWe were talking a lot for the first bit and my wife has depression so our talking kind of slows down and picks back up depending on how she is that day and usually a few days right before her period her depression gets pretty bad.\n\nThe past few days have been rough with her being mad at me for literally everything like almost like she's trying to find things to be mad at but she refuses to have a phone call to talk about it so it's all been through text and the excuse is our daughter won't let us talk. When I was home last she told me how much she appreciates how hard I work so she can be a stay at home mom and us have a lot of nice things. The main cause for the anger seems to be she doesn't feel like my wife and feels like a single mom which I understand I'm not home and romance is next to impossible while I'm gone.\n\nIs there any way I can fix this and not have the anger in the future? It's really affecting our relationship and I'm worried that she might want to leave me eventually.\nFinancially we can't afford me having a job that is at home because all the local work in my industry doesn't pay very well and we can't really afford to have me change industries as it would be too much of a pay cut. She doesn't make enough to make putting our daughter in child care worth it so we agreed to have her go back to work when our daughter goes to school.\n\nThanks\n\nTLDR\nWife gets mad at me because I work too much but also appreciates how much I work so she can be a stay at home mom.

As I was scrolling through the pages of apps before I could see all the pages he said “where are you going?” Then took his phone back. I’ve been overthinking this and I’m worried he’s still using hinge even though he told me he deleted it. I’ve had ex’s be unfaithful in the past and I’m not sure if it’s just my trust issues getting in the way.\n\nEdit: i want to thank people for the much needed advice. I think I’m going to continue the relationship and try to be less untrusting and if I still find myself not being able to trust him then I will end things with him and focus on myself. ",

      "content": "I (F23) am starting to think dating just isn’t for me.\nIt’s getting really hard to find genuine men who aren’t just completely selfish bums.\n\nI met this guy (39) in July last year. From the start, he told me he didn’t want a relationship right away because he had recently broken up with the mother of his four kids.\nHe did say there might be a chance for something serious between us eventually.\n\nWe became friends with benefits, and I was okay with that because he’s the most handsome man I’ve ever seen. I know that’s shallow, but whatever.\n\nThe first time we had sex, he paid for the hotel, and I was pleasantly surprised. We both had a great time.\nBut after that, every single time we went to a hotel, he expected me to pay. He always had some excuse.\nWe went maybe 8 times, and aside from the first, I was always the one paying, for the room and even for the condoms.\n\nLately, he’s been asking me to buy him things like shoes, jeans, perfume.\nI’ve already bought him a pair of shoes, two perfumes, and a shirt, but he just keeps asking for more.\nAnd it’s not like it’s small stuff because he only wears designer brands.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, my job contract ended and I’ve been struggling to find a new one.\nOn top of that, I lost over $4k in a crypto scam at the end of last year.\nSo no, I really can’t afford to keep buying him gifts. And honestly, I don’t want to anymore, especially because he knows about the scam and my struggles finding a job.\nStill, he keeps sending me pictures of shoes he wants me to buy for him. It’s like he doesn’t care.\nI just feel like a dumb, desperate cash cow.\n\nFor Christmas, he did get me a perfume set, a watch, and a bracelet. I really appreciated that, it felt genuine. And I’d never even asked him for anything.\n\nBut I still feel sad, because not once has he ever invited me anywhere unless it involved buying him something.\nEvery time we see each other, it’s either in his car or mine. That’s it.\n\nHe also has three phone numbers, and he blocked me on two of them because he doesn’t want me texting or calling him there.\nWhen he does message me, it’s almost always during work hours, never outside of that.\n\nI’m honestly starting to feel like my whole life is just one giant scam, and I’m so over it.\nWhy are black men like this? I’m sick of them.\n",

We've hit a rocky period because he kept grabbing me when I didn't want him to and it pushed me away a little bit. Last Sunday, I go over to his house to talk, and I smell something strange on his lips. I could've sworn I smelled another woman, if you catch my meaning. Seeing as I am one, I kinda know the smell. He's also starting to become more distant. Lastly, that same night, he randomly looked at my phone and saw a text from my male friend. I've been 100% open about the fact that I have guy friends, although I keep them at a respectable distance as to not cause worry. James looked at my phone and said \"Who the fuck is [blank]?\" I initially thought he was joking, he said it in an aggressive tone but I have SPCD so I usually just assume people are kidding when they speak to me like that out of nowhere. His tone never shifted, nor did his face. He seemed genuine. Something doesn't feel right to me. What do you guys think?\n\n*Edited for a typo I made LMAO",

She has been and still is struggling in school, and the same goes for her mental health. Her self-esteem is always low, and she’s really insecure about her appearance. For the past two years, I’ve been showing her as much love and support as I can, constantly reminding her that she’s beautiful and loved.\n\nWe also have some intimate problems. She’s asexual, and I’m not. I’ve tried to find a compromise so that both her needs and mine are met. I would never pressure her into anything she doesn’t want, but it’s still difficult at times. I love her, but it can feel lonely emotionally and physically.\n\nHer dad is very strict and keeps pressuring her to get a job. She’s applied to many places, but she hasn’t heard back, and it is making her feel even more hopeless. On top of that, there’s a guy in her class who touched her inappropriately about a year before we started dating. She still has to see him regularly, which is incredibly hard for her. Recently, though, she’s started opening up to me more about what happened and how it affects her. I know that’s a big step for her, and I’m proud of her but it’s also heavy.\n\nThe truth is, every single one of her problems ends up on me. She’s a very emotional person and cries often, usually on my shoulder. I’ve always been her emotional support, and I don’t mind being there for her I love her. But I’m starting to feel the weight of it all. I don’t really have an outlet myself, and it’s hard to carry both her pain and my own.\n\nI’ve tried to be strong and patient, but I’m tired. I feel like I can’t talk to my friends about this anymore because they just say things like, “You knew what you signed up for” or “Just thug it out.” But I didn’t sign up for her pain I signed up for her, because I love her.\n\nI can’t imagine my life without her. She’s my best friend and the person I care about most. I just don’t know how to keep being everything for her without slowly losing myself in the process.\n\nHas anyone else been in a situation like this? How do you support someone you love deeply without burning out?",

      "title": "Step-mum (61F) gatekeeping access to our dad (65M) after his stroke",
      "content": "My dad had a stroke two months ago. It was a serious one and the prognosis was not good initially, but he’s a fighter and is now on the road to recovery and was discharged from hospital last week.\n\nMy sister (31F) and I (29F) have a complicated relationship with him. He and our mum separated about 8 years ago after he had an affair with my mum's friend. Their marriage was not a happy one and they should have separated years earlier, but the affair was the bomb that blew it all up. I made a considerable effort to stay connected with him and even was actively accepting of his new partner (the woman he had the affair with). I genuinely liked her before any of this happened and made an effort to be supportive, despite the circumstances. My sister did not take it all as well, but she still maintained a slightly more strained relationship with him.\n\nOver time though, it felt like he chose his new life and family over us. He didn’t tell us when he remarried, and moved back into our childhood home with her, which our mum had just moved out of, expecting it to be sold. It all felt very underhand and an active move to shut us out.\n\nWhen he had the stroke, we dropped everything and rushed home to be by his side in hospital. His wife was there too, and initially things were friendly. But after a few days, she started avoiding us when we visited. Before we left that first week, I spoke with her to offer support and reassure her that we wanted to help. The conversation turned emotional, and she said she didn’t feel comfortable with us being at the house. Her reasoning was that since we’d previously said we didn’t feel right visiting (which was true - it felt painful being back in our old home now with his replacement family), that nothing had changed and she still didn’t want us there.\n\nWe respected that and for two months, we’ve been making long day trips (we live 100 miles away) to see him in hospital.\n\nNow that he's home, we reached out about visiting over Father’s Day weekend. We kept it open-ended and said we were happy to work around what felt appropriate for him and her. She replied suggesting we meet for a coffee in town, for exactly one hour, as they need to be home for his carers, meds, and so he can rest. I understand he’s still fatigued and adjusting to life at home, but a 6-hour round trip for one hour with him feels unreasonable.\n\nI can’t shake the feeling she’s putting up barriers. I don’t want to question her intentions outright, I know she’s been doing a huge amount to care for him and this is a difficult transition. But it’s starting to feel like she’s gatekeeping him from us. My dad isn’t great with tech or communication since the stroke, and all contact has to go through her now.\n\nWhat’s the best way to navigate this? I want to be respectful and constructive, not blow things up, but I also want to be honest that we are a part of his life and we need to find a way to move forward in a way that is comfortable for all of us.\n\n\nTLDR:  Dad’s recovering from a stroke, but our step-mum is restricting visits and won’t let us in the house. We’re worried she’s gatekeeping him and not sure how to address it without making things worse.",

      "title": "I 29F and Husband 29M have been having really bad problems.. what would you do?",
      "content": "What would you do if you were in this relationship? \nI 29/F and  husband 29/M have been in a relationship for 12 years.  We were high school sweethearts, had a child basically straight out of high school and had to grow up really fast. We have had our occasional normal married drama, fights, feeling distant, but we have always worked everything out. But Over the past couple of years though, I feel like our relationship has gotten progressively worse. I feel like the “spark” is gone. And yea, I know, that happens in long marriages, but this is different. I feel like I’m in one of those dreams, you know where you’re screaming at someone to stop but they don’t care and continue to do it… and honestly, it’s been happing for so long, it’s hard to pinpoint when I started to feel this way, because I’ve learned to cover it up so well. But I would say I really began to notice when I had two miscarriages back to back when we were trying for another child. I basically went through them alone. The pain, the hurt, everything. He never asked me how I was doing, never held my hand, and never noticed that for weeks I would lay on the couch after he feel asleep and cry. I feel like that broke me, but I was so consumed in my own grief, I never saw how he treated me until after I got over the grief. Then some time went by, and I became pregnant and this one stuck. But this pregnancy was horrible. I was so depressed. I felt horrible. Through out the pregnancy I would beg him to show me affection. To tell me I’m beautiful. I wanted him to rub my belly, talk to our daughter and make both of us feel loved, but I never got that. I never got that with any of my pregnancies.. He would tell me he is so sorry, and that he needed to do better, but a week later it would go back. Eventually I stopped trying. After I had my daughter we went through another waning period. No improvement, just us carrying on as things were. By this time I was in school full time, was a full time mom, which one of my children is special needs and needs constant care, and keeping the household together. I started to get burnt out. My husband had no motivation. He is not the bread winner in our household. He pays his bills and I pay mine. He also isnt a typical husband that does all the “manly” things like fix things, gets the cars serviced, anything like that. I do ALL of that, or I call my dad…. But mostly it’s me. He always says he doesn’t know how, and that he doesn’t want to “mess it up” . And I have to ask him a solid three days before he will mow the grass, or I will just do it. And he doesn’t take pride in his work. I’ve also been telling him for a long time he needs to lose weight… he is getting really big… and It’s taking an affect on his health as well, because he blood pressure of very high sometimes… but again, he says he knows, then tries to make me feel bad because he thinks I’m calling him fat… but you have to be attracted physically and emotionally to your partner. For the last two years he hasn’t gotten me a birthday gift because he has had “no money”.. or even a Mother’s Day gift for the same reason… He never asks me how I’m feeling, and then asks me why I being like this. He never sees my pain. We never go on trips or dates. We aren’t passionate. He is comfortable. There has been months where I’m begging him for affection.. and not just sex.. just simple cuddling, hugging, just feeling really loved. And believe me when I tell you, I have begged and pleaded for him to even make the smallest changes. But we still have the same fights over and over, and every time I ask him if there is something I’m doing wrong that it causing him not to change for me and it’s always nothing. I tell him we need counseling and that if he wants to do it he need to schedule it and he never does. The thing is, it’s changes that should come so easily, like caring, helping, taking initiative, being a husband. Things that should be there as a foundation. The need to take care of his family. I’m the only one that has ever sacrificed so much of myself to better our family. I went in the military when my first son was one years old. (We have three kids now) That was the hardest thing I ever had to do, but I know it was a guaranteed income… then I was in a really bad training accident and lost some of my closest friends and I was forced to medically retire, but it also took a lot mentally out of me. I knew we were still going no where so I went to school. It’s been one little thing after another piling up. It’s to a point that his sorrys are just words. But the hardest part of it is, is that he is such a good guy. Besides all of the other stuff he is my best friend. We can laugh together. He knows me inside and out. He never hesitates when I need a break from the kids. He would let me go on a week long vacation if I wanted to. And he is such a great dad…  he bring me flowers “occasionally “ and never complains when I spend money.. even though most of the times it’s from my paycheck… He is such a selfless person. I feel so guilty, but I also feel burnt out. So burnt out that I don’t want to be home. And there is a part of me find myself at times seeking other attention. I’ve never cheated, but I think about what my life would be like with someone else. I’m so lost. ",

      "content": "This argument is long and drawn out over several years. Basically, I spoke up about my discomfort with my dad during my adolescence and my sister got upset with me after my mom cried to her over the phone. She says I can’t just cut out dad and not mom, that it hurts mom and all of my 5 older siblings. Here’s our text convo from today: \n\nMe: Hey so I don’t need your permission to set boundaries with Dad, or anyone else. I’m not looking for your approval, and I don’t care if you agree. I think for myself, and I’ve made my choice. If you want a relationship with me, it has to be on equal terms. I’m not interested in being talked down to anymore.\n\nMy older sister: Set boundaries for what? You're not setting boundaries with dad, you're cutting him out of your life for something he didnt do and saying that he did it. Imagine having a child and joking with them or showing love and care and having them turn around and accuse you of something you never thought you did. Ever. Imagine that, that would be awful. Just because something made you feel uncomfortable and you perceived it a certain way doesnt mean that it was. Every situation is different and you got this wrong and you're breaking both mom and dad's heart. I guess you just have to be right. I saw with my own eyes dad smack you on the butt and it was literally his joke with you. Doesn't make it okay that it made you uncomfortable but you could have had a conversation with him about it and he would have stopped. He obviously didnt understand that it did at the time. It’s so awful what youre doing and it really upsets me so I'm sorry. What equal terms? What's equal? Youre not being fair to anyone. You come down on everyone. You got upset at [brother] and [brother’s wife] for saying Happy Thanksgiving. You are so blind [my name]. You need to just look at the bigger picture and choose peace with the family so you can be happy again. No one is perfect, but I guess you need people to be to have a relationship.\n\nMy older sister again: If this isn't gonna be a nice or understanding and constructive conversation don't respond to me. I cant argue with you. Ive had a very hard and busy week .\n\nI haven’t responded and I don’t plan to. Im sorry there is a lot to this story. What are you gathering from this?\n\nEdit: I did tell him to stop smacking my butt when I got off the couch, every time. He laughed and he still did it. A conversation would have done nothing.  ",

      "content": "*TLDR*\nJust letting you know you’re finna read a book lmaooo. So to put things into context. I Js recently considered dating again. I’ve been talking to this one girl in particular for about a month now. It’s been a bumpy ride but here are all the facts. It’s only been chatting via phone. She lives across the state from me. Not terrible imo but In the beginning when we first talking we hit it off pretty well. After talking for a bit we kinda naturally started calling each other names and such, I can however note that it was all on her initiative. You could say I was moving at her pace I guess. Which is where I messed up I think. Anyways fast forward a couple days and I noticed something in a bio of her snap. Then i asked myself if the relationship I was in was a polyamorous relationship or monogamous one. So one day I brought it up one day and lo and behold, it’s poly. There’s 3 others excluding me. 2Ms and 1F. I was devastated, I couldn’t understand how someone could “love” all thoses people like that at the same time. I was confused and didn’t know what to do. I wanted her to pick me, I wanted it to be us. At the end of that conversation we decided to give her a month to drop the others. She claims out of all 4 I’m the one she wants to marry. So I decided to stay and wait the month out. That’s rlly the “bumps” in context but recently (last 4 days) she’s been in a “depression episode” where she shuts down, bet rots and doesn’t communicate to anyone. I mean anyone. And every time I try to talk to her, to try and cheer her up or bring her out of it she says I’m being to pushy and that I need to give her time and space for her to come out of it on her own. Which had led us to today, I told her that we needed to make a point to have a conversation together. I was going to tell her how I felt like I was being pushed away and such, I’ll just let you read. This is how it went, I can’t ss any of it because it’s all on Snapchat. To keep it easy for you to know who’s saying what, everything said by me will be in “()” while everything she said will be in “[]” (So instead of asking to speak about something I should just instead just say it?)   [Yeah speak yo mind]   (I’m sorry if I say the wrong things, I’m trying my best for you. But I love you, and what I mean by that is i accept you for who you are, all your insecurities; what you see as\nimperfections, i see simply as parts of you that make you yourself. it means that i won't try to change you into someone different, it means that i will always care for you and be there for you no matter what comes in between us. it means i'll stand by you and love you through the worst of times. that means loving you in a bad mood, when you're down, it means loving you and supporting you when you're too tired to do the things i want to do. it means me putting you before myself or anyone else. it means loving you all of the time. when i tell you \"i love you\" it means you can tell me anything if you ever want to and i'll always listen and never judge you. it means that i care enough to fight for you and hold you and never let go. it means i'm always thinking of you, dreaming of you, wishing i could be with you when i'm not. \"i love you\" to me, is the connection between two people's hearts, beauty, personalities, and soul. it means we are intertwined into each others paths. it means that i'm not only in \"this\" for a sexual way, or a physical way. i'm in \"this\" (relationship) for all of you, everything you do and feel. it means there's a deeper connection that anyone else wouldn't be able to comprehend. it means always needing you or wanting you, knowing that you feel the same way towards me and trusting you to feel similarly. there is more to \"i love you\" than i can describe in words so i'll just put it in one. ineffable. It hurts me to see you try and battle this war u have going on with your depression all alone when it doesn’t have to be that way. I want to be able to support you not because a can but because I’m choosing to. And that’s the thing about love, it’s a choice. Not an “if it was meant to be it’ll happen” because that’s bs. Love is a choice made by 2 people that are choosing to deal with everything that could be thrown at them because that’s love. Love is unconditional. And it feels like you’re not letting me choose. I want to help, I want to be your support and be there for you but if feels like you believe you can do better on your own. I want you to be able to be open with me about what makes you depressed and what makes you happy. So I can’t do my bestest to help you. But it’s been 4 days of me just waiting on the sidelines, waiting for your call to let me back in your life again. I don’t want to push you away, I want you to see me as a solution to your problems, I want you to be you joy and happiness. I can’t do that out on the sidelines not in the game yk. It hurts me to see you try and go thru this alone. I don’t what you to be alone because you don’t have to be. I just want to know and understand that I do love you. And I do want to help you. And I am here for you. I don’t want to go anywhere. I want to be here with you, I want to show you all my love I have for you. I don’t want you to be alone baby. You don’t have to be alone, you can tell me anything and I’ll stay thru it all. There’s nothing you can say that will make me not love you. I need you to trust me and have faith that I won’t let you down. Because I’m going all in with you baby I promise I am. I want nothing but you, I hope you understand and don’t keep me in the dark anymore. I don’t mean to be pushy I’m just trying my absolute best to show you that I love you and do care for you because I don’t know how to show you all those things way back here on the sidelines. I hope you understand and won’t be mad or upset with me. Please don’t push me away anymore, it hurts me. I love you, I truly do. I truly hope you understand)   [Am upset but that's fine] (That all you have to say?)   [idk what to say.]    ( Say anything, what’s coming to you head. Be open and transparent with me baby)  [Nothings really coming to my head it's all blank tbh like silent so uhh] (I love you. Don’t forget that) *Opened* (You don’t love me anymore do you? I’ve pushed you to far? I’m trying my best for you my love, I truly am. I wouldn’t have just poured my heart out to you if I didn’t want it to be you that would actually care for me) [I do love you but u did kinda push me too far] (You told me to speak my mind.. Just come back to me when you’re ready please. I’m choosing you please don’t give up on me I don’t know how to love you from the sidelines like this, please show me how) [I'm not saying to bottle up how u feel that was good to know how u feel but it was the shit prior to when I was telling you I needed time and u were pushy] (I’m sorry I don’t know how to show my love to you correctly, I rlly am trying tho. I’m sorry I didn’t say all that sooner I didn’t know how to. Please forgive me. I’ll be more straightforward and considerate about timing. I promise I’m trying to learn how to love you properly. I want to so badly. I don’t try to be pushy, but you’re the only person I talk to and the last 4 days have been so insanely miserable without you here to comfort me. I’ve miss you so much, it hurts to not have your attention anymore when it was all I had. I promise, give me another chance and I’ll be better. Please don’t leave me. I won’t be so pushy for you to come out of this phase. I’ll let you come out at your own pace. I’m sorry.) [I’ll give u another chance but some feelings have already went away bc of what u did] (Tell me what I did ŵřǒňğ, so I won’t do it again. Where did I go ŵřǒňğ?) [Just give me time okay.] (More time. Okay)    That’s rlly the end of that conversation. Do I need to leave the relationship? Do I need to put of with that kinda of behavior? Is that acceptable? I don’t want to end it. I just don’t know where to stand anymore. I need your advice and insight please. ",

      "content": "Me and my boyfriend have been happily together for almost three years, we always communicate and share our feelings when needed. We have been doing long distance for half of the relationship. Recently, he went overseas for a school trip and during this trip we got into an argument. He ended up calling me degrading names and told me go to fuck myself. I'll admit, I was being a little controlling and insecure at the time, but not enough for him to cross that line. My boyfriend is aware of the home I grew up in, how that type of fighting was normalized, so it came as a shock when he exhibited those same traits. After a few days of not talking to each other, we had a long phone call and it only made me realize this relationship could end up failing in the future. (Btw he has apologized for his actions) \n\nI have always been supportive of his passion, but don't have the same goals. I want to stay in my province, where it's closer to family, and even settle with a house in in my name. My boyfriend has always been into traveling and plans to do remote based jobs. We have always expressed our differences but was never hit with the reality of it, up until now. Part of the reason why I'm considering is because I don't want to live a life where I'm waiting for my partner to come home, only to leave the next day. Asking him to stay will only mean his happiness will be sacrificed, and me going with him, will make me unhappy. There's no compromise.\n\nI don't want to hold him back, but is letting him go the answer? How do you give someone up you thought you'd marry?",

      "content": "I (26f) have been dating my boyfriend (28m) for a little over a year. When we started dating his house was like a work in progress. He bought it from his grandparents when the moved to Arizona. So he has been updating it on his own while working full time. \n\nIn the last year he’s finished a lot of what he wanted to do and I’m really proud of how hard he’s worked and it makes me happy to see him happy about how nice everything came out.\n\nSo like out of nowhere on Sunday he casually mentions that maybe since he’s pretty much done with everything but the basement, I could move in with him. I usually spend about three nights a week at his house from Thursday through Saturday. I have an apartment. He said all he’d ask is that I pay for cable if I wanted it because he doesn’t have it and only watches stuff on a few streaming services.\n\nI know this would end up saving me a lot of money. But I just don’t know if I’m ready for this just yet. My lease comes up in September and I was planning on just renewing for another year.\n\nI didn’t respond right away and I think he could tell I wasn’t really sure about it. He seemed maybe a little hurt that I said I’d have to think about it. He hasn’t brought it up again and we only talked twice on the phone this week which isn’t normal for us. I’m supposed to go to his place tomorrow after work. Now I’m worried it might be weird.\n\nI really love this guy. He’s the best boyfriend I could ask for. But we haven’t ever talked about living together and he just like brought it up out of nowhere. My mother said not to be too hasty and to think it over. My best friend said she thinks we’re great together and I should take him up on it. Is this moving too fast? I’ve never been in a relationship where I seriously thought about living with the person.\n\nAnd, yes I can see myself spending my life with him. How would you all handle this? Does it seem like it’s too soon after a year?\n\nTL;DR: my (26f) boyfriend (28m) of one year suggested I move in with him. I’m not sure if I should or not.",

Definitely not my cup of tea so I introduced him to my sister. Fast forward: they got together, got married, had a baby, began disliking each other,  and then divorced.  They are not friends. They do not get along. They only speak if it has to do with their child, and are pretty happy in their separate current relationships. \nOr so I thought.  \nI became friends with his now current partner Raven, and we are literally so close. Tell me why she calls me to tell me he is moving into the SAME building my sister lives in. Tells me shes been telling him for hours how it was a stupid idea, and how it was going to be so confusing for his daughter. Well.. doesnt seem like he cared because he went, saw the apartment,  signed the lease and got the keys all in three hours of her talking to him about how uncomfortable she was. because it was like he was moving there to be close to his ex wife again. She's not the only one who thinks that. So does my sisters current partner. They faught about it. Badly. Because he couldn't understand why her ex husband would want to live right on top of her unless there was an agenda. My sister wanted no part of him being there and the only person who thought it was a good idea was HIM! \nNow Ravens heartbroken and unsure about the future because he tends to side with his ex wife over her. No matter how hard Raven fights and makes the best arguments as to why something should or shouldnt happen, or even if its something she can help with,He doesn't  care about how it would affect her. Affect anyone for that matter. Just doing exactly what he wanted with no care. My sisters slowly calming down and her boyfriend is finally taking a breath for the first time in 24 hours. \n Does anyone have any insights or experiences with this kind of behavior, and if so what did you do?

The few times we have been together have been so much fun, we’ve been on dates to the zoo, bike riding around the city, a coffee date where we programmed together side by side, bars and raves and movies. We hang out online almost every day, we’ve played Minecraft and the entirety of the Halo series together. I enjoy dressing up for him, and giving him gifts. He’s made me a custom LED wood sign from one of my favourite games. \n\nI’ve said things to him that have made him insecure about how he looks and our relationship.

      "content": "I am a recovering alcoholic and so is he. We have both been to treatment (rehab) and I am coming up on 2 years of being alcohol-free.\n\nSince moving in with my partner about 6 months ago, things have felt off. I wish I noticed sooner. He hasn’t had any money (I’ve been paying all of the bills, paying for cat food, loaning him money, etc.) I just thought it was because his job only paid $18.00 per hour. But then again, it doesn’t make sense if he had $0.00 for rent or anything recently, since the only other bills he would’ve had would have been his car insurance and health insurance and phone bill.\n\nAnyways - I went out of town, alone, on a trip that I made the tough choice of disinviting him from, since he was able to absolutely contribute nothing to it financially. I said even if he could give me $100.00, it would be okay. But he couldn’t.\n\nI come back and he is off his rocker, abusing Xanax. He goes to a seedy part of town the next day (after my return) to buy more pills and gets his car stolen. I then pick up and meet a couple members of his family at a gas station nearby, to file a police report for the car. As they pull up, a shooting breaks out. It was absolutely terrifying. I have to log into work at 7:00 AM and I cannot calm down until 2:00 AM.\n\nThe next day, he is picked up by his grandmother and is in treatment. The treatment only lasted NINE DAYS, which I feel was not enough time at all, and more of a detox. Since then, he has been staying with his grandmother trying to get his affairs in order. He was also fired from his job while in rehab.\n\nI went over a few times to visit, have dinner, etc. and when I would return home, he would accuse me of “betraying him” or “conspiring with his family to entice a reaction out of him” - none of this occurred, and actually I had a pleasant time visiting with his grandmother and sister when I went over for dinner. Maybe this pissed him off?\n\nI then ask for space - I don’t give an end date, but I am still processing everything. I go have a lovely day with friends at a state park this past Saturday.\n\nA half an hour after I return from the state park, his grandmother just randomly drops him off. We both start sobbing crying and I tell him I absolutely cannot continue this relationship at this point, as I feel my sobriety is in danger (and I feel in danger in general, after the gun).\n\nHe begs me. He is sobbing. It was horrible. He says I “saved him”. But how?\n\nAfter he calms down a bit, he comes clean that in addition to doing the Xanax, he has actually be abusing heroin for the past 6 months. I never noticed any track marks, or anything really. I have never once been exposed to heroin. I at least got closure to where the finances were going.\n\nHe also mentioned that he was entertaining the idea of a threesome with a coworker and the coworker’s husband - all behind my back. I honestly do not even care about that at this point, since I’m so mind-blown at the heroin, the stolen car, the shooting, etc. at this point.\n\nI then take him home (to his grandmother’s) and say goodbye.\n\nSince then, he texts me regardless. Promising he will change. He swears he is going to take the medication, talk to therapists, get his life in check and can’t do it without me by his side. I feel he needs to do this for himself, and not me? I have not replied. He is even sending messages saying how much he misses the cats, and asking me to tell them he “loves them”.\n\nI am absolutely heartbroken and devastated. I feel so lost and betrayed and used. I also feel guilt - if I was a good partner, wouldn’t I stay by his side while he gets better.. I feel, in a way, I am acting selfish. He did make the right decision to accept and go to treatment, even if I feel it wasn’t long enough. And yet I still left and can’t do it. \n\nI just don’t know anymore. \n\n",

I thought the whole point was to try and see if America was for me (which it clearly isn’t) and to move back to Australia where we have free healthcare and a better life. He doesn’t want to compromise anymore. He’s fine with living in America forever. I’m not.\n\nWe’ve only been married for a few months so I don’t have my green card. I love him so much - he’s my best friend and I don’t want to be with anyone else but at the same time he’s changed so drastically. For instance, I was working all the time in Australia but then he went from not wanting me to work and doing all the house chores and not helping me one bit, to then saying I need to get a job because he’s struggling to maintain the bills. Then he said he’s not fine with me having my own bank account. I haven’t budged - I told him I’m not okay with having shared accounts because I like having my own money. He keeps insisting we should have a shared account as we live in the same house but my name is not on the title due to me not being a citizen, so I don’t understand his logic. He’s also now said that he thought the whole time I was making more money than him was emasculating - which I’ve said is a ridiculous thing to say. \n\nAnother thing is that he seems to be like my father and not in a good way. I tried watching a TV show with him that had a gay couple adopting a child and he switched it off because he didn’t want to watch “degeneracy”. I was shocked as he has gay friends and would never say that to their face. I thought he was different as they are part of our friendship group. I once misspoke and said I didn’t want to have kids, when I was meant to say I wasn’t sure in having kids as I went through a traumatic miscarriage. Instead of comforting me he immediately resorted to saying “Okay, let’s get the marriage annulled.” He was so cold towards me that night and I haven’t forgotten it. He also keeps asking me when I’m going to lose weight as I have PCOS and it’s been very difficult for me to lose it. I’ve lost 28lbs and still have another 66 to go but he is not happy with me physically. \n\nI also don’t want to have kids with him at the moment due to him suddenly becoming lazy. The years we were long distance and taking trips with each other he would always help out. Now he refuses to do the dishes, wash his clothes or cook because he’s “working” and I’m at home “doing nothing”. When really I’m doing everything on my own and him leaving out dishes is not making my job easier. I’ve asked him to do simple things like putting dirty dishes into the dishwasher but he doesn’t do it, claims he “forgets” as well as forgetting to lock the house door, which makes me feel unsafe and unable to trust him. I take care of his dog all the time and clean up after him but my husband only feeds him and that’s it. My husband says he can’t afford to buy me a PC so I can keep in contact with my friends but is happy to play with his friends on his PC leaving me alone to do nothing while I told I feel lonely and isolated. I feel like I can’t win.\n\nAny advice would be helpful. \n\nTL;DR\nHusband has changed his behaviour and mind on where we can live and I’m conflicted if I should leave him or not as I don’t think he will want to come live me.

We’ve had our ups and downs but we’ve always been very compatible in our interests(working out, food, travel, hobbies etc) \nOur relationship started off great, with lots of sex but around 1.5 year mark we had some health issue that left her depressed for a few months. It went away but our sexual relationship never sort of recovered. She went to school for a year, Covid happened and after that we got married. It was more comfort than trying to ask the question if we are missing physical compatibility. \nWhat hurts me the most is that I have inadvertently seen things she and her ex did and it’s nowhere near close to what we do. She still doesn’t complain or ever make an effort to have sex. \nLast year we had sex a total of 8 times. She is a beautiful blonde but just doesn’t have any sexual interest. She has a past history of sexual abuse, which I don’t think plays a role here but I am not certain. What can we do to improve from here? Is there any hope for us or do I just accept my fate?(divorce is not an option, due to our 6 month baby and I genuinely want to make it work\n\n Edit: having asked her this question over the years, the answers have varied\n- tired from school\n- tired from work\n- I don’t make an effort(where as I do all the time)\n- let’s schedule something on calendar\n- I kissed you in the morning and you didnt notice ",

      "content": "My girlfriend and I have been together for 10 months now. She means a world to me and so do I to her. We both never felt love the right way and I am sure this is true love. So does she. We communicate well, get along great and never had big problems except for this.\n\n\n\nSince before we got together she was honest and told me she sometimes does coke and other stuff. I told her that i had really bad experiances with friends that took drugs and I didn't like that. I actually said I hate people that do it because I never met a nice person that was using the same stuff. But we were truly clouded with love and didn't really care about those comments then. Well it came back to bite us.\n\n\n\nI personally never tried anything except for weed when I was in highschool. I don't party often maybe once or twice a year and drink only on special occasions like weddings etc. All of this is new to me and I honestly didn't know what I was getting my self into.\n\n\n\nShe stopped using after we had an argument around Christmas after she used and I threthened to leave her because I was so hurt when I saw how she acted while she was under influence. We are both very introverted and like each others company, but when she was under she became introverted and started talking to everyone. I became very anxious and honestly emotions took over.\n\n\n\nFast forward to now she vent for a weekend trip with her 2 girls. I was anxious the whole time whenever she sent me a pic I was inspecting her eyees to see if i can find if she used. She told me she never did anything. I will be honest I was frequantly asking her how was her night, did she use anything in a joking manor. And when she said no a rock was lifted and I was happy. Until one night when she became extremely needy and expressed her love to me like she never did when she was on a party. Took a picture and her pupils were very dilated. I became suspicious. She came home I asked her multiple times and was pretty sure she didn't do anything. I told her to swear on our dogs life. She swore. I thought ok she is telling the truth, but I was still feeling something i can't explain the feeling. We had a fight about it, She telling me I'm being annoying and to just drop it. I asked her can I go through your phone. She said yes. And boom I found she took mdma. Her hearth dropped she became speechless told me if I wasn't so controlling about her taking drugs she wouldn't feel the need to lie. Her friends supported her. My hearth shattered. Fast forward a few days we had a huge fight with me being a total asshole. Emotions took completely over and I said horrible stuff like, you lying junky, I hate you, I am sorry I ever met you etc. When things settled a bit we forgave each other. And now I got to the point where I know she will lie to me about it again, and told her. Look I really can't move forward with you if you continue using, I am very much against drugs and can't live like this. She told me she is still young and she wants to live her life and doesn't want anyone to control her. That if she wants to do it she will. I asked so you're choosing drugs over us. She said I need to choose either I will be fine with it or not that its up to me.\n\n\n\nI never wanted to give the ultimatum because it's her life she can live with it the way she wants. But I just can't shake the feeling of anxiety and discomfort. I can't sleep while she is out partying always thinking about it, it affects my life very negatively.\n\n\n\nThe real problem now is we live together pay rent together, she can't go anywhere. Her parents caused her significant trauma and she doesn't have anyone to go to. As of todays conversation we will probably break up which broke my hearth and have been crying for 1 hour now since we ended our conversation. We have to live together until she finds a way to leave. I can't leave her on her own as she wouldn't be able to afford living alone. I very much love her and don't know if I'm making a mistake. Maybe I just need to tough it out until she grows up. Because I really see her as a lifetime partner except for this one little thing.\n\n\n\nI plan to talk about it with my therapist, but I am pretty sure she will be on my side and tell me things I alreay know. I don't want to drag my friends into this since this is her life and people don't need to know stuff like that about her. So I am turning to reddit since I don't have anyone else to talk to about this.\n\n\n\nAny advice would be appreciated\n\n\n\nTL;DR: GF uses hard drugs. I am not okay with it. We live together and cant afford to separate. I don't want to be with her because it gives me extreme anxiety. She won't stop using until she becomes a little older because she wants to try thing while she is young.",

I’m a very patient person and I try and be soft and kind about all this but I’m frankly starting to  get angry. He’s given me a few reasons: it’s a mental block that stops him from staying hard, fear of not satisfying me, childhood trauma, casual sex being easier than a more serious loving relationship…etc. (he *has* had successful intimacy with coworkers, friends, ex gf’s but often times it doesn’t work). He used to “service” me in other ways but hasn’t in months… we don’t even really make out much. We do share intimacy in other ways – talking close, cuddles, holding hands, and tender kisses. We are best friends and I know it in my bones that he loves me but the lack of physical relations is really weighing on my self-worth.\nThe other issue is that he may have a porn addiction(?) I’ve seen pages and pages of tabs on his phone with a crazy array of “genres”. We’ve talked about it and since then he says he has backed off a bit from it but not entirely. I don’t think porn is a bad thing usually but when he’s still using it twice a day instead of being intimate with me… I feel so inadequate. He doesn’t want to try pills, he doesn’t want to see the doctor, and I can’t see him not masturbating for a while to see if anything may change. My self worth is tanking – I’ve always been on the chubbier side and I can’t help but to think that maybe he’s just not physically attracted to me. What am I supposed to do? Am I wasting my time? We’ve been fighting more and more about this and I don’t want to make the situation worse by talking about it all the time… ",

      "title": "My roommate (23F) and I (23F) grew apart after I got back together with my boyfriend (23M)— how do I decide if moving out is the right next step?",
      "content": "I (23F) live with a roommate (23F) I will call her A, and a second roommate (23F) I will call her B. We moved to a new city and in together after we graduated college and had gotten extremely close throughout our senior year. I started dating Jack (23M) right before we moved in: August 2024. Our relationship hit a rough patch early this year, and we briefly broke up. He has since started getting treatment for mental health issues, and we’ve been working through things and are back together.\n\nThe night he broke up with me, we had all been drinking. He came over to my friend's house and broke up with me. Afterwards, A texted Jack begging him to come back to the house so that they could talk (she witnessed him breaking up with me). He basically told her no because he thought she would yell at him (she has always been super protective of me) and he said some hurtful things to her in response to her not taking no for an answer.\n\nDuring the time we were apart, A and B both came to me and explained that they thought he had been controlling during our relationship. I started going back to therapy after the breakup and was very open with my therapist about our relationship and our conversations. My therapist and I decided that this was not a toxic relationship or one that I needed to leave.\n\nAfter lots of talking and working through the obstacles in our relationship we got back together. Both A and B had told me that although they wished I wouldn't get back together with him because they think I deserve better, they would support me either way. He spent the night at our apartment and B was home, so I let her know he was coming over. The next day A was very upset with me and I did not know why. I went to her room to ask why and she told me it was nothing and to leave her alone in a dismissive tone. For the next week she would not look me in the eye or acknowledge my existence. After I tried to talk about it in person and was dismissed I tried to give her space.\n\nI ended up texting her about it because I thought maybe it was too hard to talk about in person. She told me that she was extremely upset that I told B before I told her that we got back together. She also wanted space from me and said that I betrayed her and only talked to her when I needed her (we had been best friends for over a year at this point and I shared a lot with her, she shared a lot with me, and I was there for her through a huge heartbreak and lots of cries). It hurt my feelings that she wrote our friendship off as me just taking advantage of her when in reality we both have always been there for each other and had a very meaningful friendship (she always said this to me and constantly thanked me for being the best friend she's ever had).\n\nI respected her wishes and gave her space. After about a month of not talking I reached out again and asked her if she wanted me to move out. She told me I was crazy for even suggesting that and blamed me for not talking to her and \"ignoring her\". I explained that I tried to give her the space that she asked for and was waiting for her to let me know when she was ready. The conversation ended on good terms but there wasn't really a resolution. She promised me multiple times that the rift between us had nothing to do with Jack and was just about me being a bad friend. I apologized again and tried to fix it. He had also apologized to her by this point twice and she forgave him and apologized to him as well.\n\nOver the last few months, I have been trying to talk to A while still giving her space. Every time I made an attempt she would either dismiss me, mumble something under her breath, or some days she would be the sweetest, kindest, friend that I had been missing. Her boyfriend stays with us often so a lot of the conversations I had with her he was also there for. He has always been nice to me and likewise. I started asking her to go on walks alone with me during my lunch breaks when I was working from home and she always accepted. Every time I thought things were getting better I would hear from someone else that she had been saying something negative about me or Jack.\n\nThe final straw was when my old roommate came to visit and A told her that I was in a controlling and toxic relationship, ruined all of my friendships for him, was male-centered, only talked to her when her boyfriend was around, and that she wished that the two of them were friends instead of her and I. It has been very hard to hear these things from someone who used to know me better than anyone else in this world. I know in my gut that I am not male centered. Yes, I have a boyfriend, but I also have other friends, lots of hobbies, and constantly do things on my own without him. I also have talked to her plenty of times without her boyfriend there and I have never been closer with him than simple small talk.\n\nI have tried to leave B out of all of this because I know she is in an uncomfortable position. I miss my friendship with her, she recently said the same thing and that she wants to talk about it, but I'm worried about trying to explain how I've felt without making her feel like she needs to pick a side.\n\nI guess I am just trying to find out if I am overreacting for wanting to move out, I will have to break the lease and find a subleaser in a city that I can barely afford to live alone in, but I feel like it is my only option at this point. It has now been over 4 months of mostly silence (and her sometimes making me feel like it's close to being repaired just to dismiss me the next day).\n\nSince I heard about the conversation she had with my old roommate I just feel so lost, lonely, confused, and like maybe I made up this entire thing or that maybe it is all my fault. Some days I feel like I'm going crazy and others I feel like I tried my best and need to just give up on any hope of A and I being friends again. Any insight, opinions, or advice would be really really appreciated. How do I decide if moving out is the right next step?\n\n**TL;DR:** I (23F) live with two roommates, A and B. I dated someone who broke up with me, then we got back together after therapy and working through issues. Roommate A got upset with me for telling B before her about the reunion and has since been distant, sometimes kind, sometimes cold. I’m struggling with whether to move out despite the financial strain because the friendship feels broken. Looking for advice on how to handle this situation. Has anyone had any similar situations? How do I decide if moving out is the right next step?",

      "content": "When we started dating for the first 9 months we would have sex every time we hung out. 2 days a week and usually 4-5 times a week. Everything was great. I told her how important a sexual relationship is to me and she loved that. Then at some point it slowed down. She started school again, but in the past that never changed anything. We hardly ever argue just have minor disagreements and have a healthy relationship. She’s a very loving person and will tease me by grabbing my d or just making out with me and cuddling but it stops there. She moved in around 13 month mark and I thought things would pick back up. The opposite happened, we slowed to 1 time a week. I asked her about it and she said it’s just because we live together now so it seems like it’s not as often. I understood and dismissed it. Then it started getting to once every two weeks. I would try to rub her back or try non sexual cuddling and kissing. Tried to initiate but she would shoot it down nonverbally or just say she’s tired. On a birthday or vacation it would pick back up to normal. Then right back to where we were. I didn’t say anything for 3 months, but it really started to mess with my self confidence. So i finally asked her again after we did the deed, if there was a reason why, she kinda didn’t say anything and said “it’s ok you’ll be fine”. I love my gf but I’m almost at the point that I don’t want to have sex at all. Recently I’ve been in no mood to cuddle or even kiss her cause I just feel like I’ve lost all say in romance. If it’s not when she wants it, it doesn’t happen. I love her all the time, and have never denied her any love. Id rather never get it than just be waiting like I’m waiting for the lottery numbers to hit and the stars to align. I will note she has always been on the implant since we started dating, and she started taking adhd medication a couple months ago when it really started to go down hill but that doesn’t explain the decrease over the last 9 months. We both work hard. She lives with me for free cause she’s in school. I help pay for a lot of the things she needs like gas, food etc. I rub her back, cook sometimes, clean. Plus do all of the outside work. So it’s not like I’m a pos that doesn’t contribute. She’s very loyal and doesn’t go to many places besides school without me, she would give me her phone if I asked for it so I don’t think she’s cheating. What do you think?",

      "content": "My (29F) sibling (25F) is dating someone long distance who is psychologically abusive (calling her dumb, a child, immature, not good enough for her standards, our family slow, etc). They’re on the phone for 4-8 hours everyday. They always fight on the weekend. They break up every 3 weeks it seems and within 2 days are back together. My sibling takes a whole week off work every single month to fly to her state to be with her in person. She is sobbing multiple times a week inconsolably in the middle of the night from this persons mean actions. It’s so toxic and pathetic. Of course there is a whole year of headaches more but that is basically the gist of it. Always the same behaviour and no accountability despite the apologies.\n\nThey recently broke up (again) and my sibling still chose to go see this person for a whole week. They left without telling my parents and they just found out today where they went. They cannot just end things. I want to cut her out from anger. No matter what we do she won’t stop her cycle of behaviour. I want to be mature and accept her decision. But I don’t want her to be with this person at ALL (and neither do any of her friends or our family). My parents tip toe around her, won’t kick her out for the disrespect and won’t charge her rent. It’s just horrible. We do not live together.",

      "content": "I’m ‘32F’ and husband is ‘33M’ and we’ve been together for 6.5 years. \n\nWe’re both extremely supportive of each other’s careers (I am more of the ambitious one who started at a low level and jumped up while he has been slow and steady on his trajectory). We’re in the same tax bracket of different industries and can both afford to let the other quit their job for a few months if needed (though it would push our house plans back a bit).\n\nMy husband’s workplace has become increasingly toxic, not anything documentable, but his new manager is making his life miserable and he doesn’t enjoy the position he’s in anymore. He has been saying for months that he wants to leave just because of this manager, though he is happy with the work he does and also kinda wants to wait it out (the manager tends to bounce around to different companies every few years, but she’s been sticking here longer than previously). He got a promotion within this team two years ago (he was already doing the work, just got the title and salary to reflect it) after i encouraged him to apply for it, his different manager was in charge of the decision and gave him the position without any hesitation. He’s happy with that decision, it didn’t really change anything for his day-to-day.\n\nHowever, today the new manager did something pretty egregious and he is furious and heartbroken. I can’t stand to see him hurting himself like this by staying there, though I know he and I both think it’s more logical for him to stay until he can find another offer.\n\nI’m pretty good at resumes and LinkedIn profiles and interviewing, so I of course said let’s sit down and hammer those out this weekend and you start looking elsewhere. He’s ready to leave too, but I think he’s reluctant to actually follow through on the steps? Maybe because it will be too decisive? I told him not to say anything to his current company about it, we’re just gonna shop around.\n\nAnyway, I know the advice is TALK TO HIM, but he’s a quiet guy who keeps his feelings to himself, I have to interpret them and act accordingly, because he always says he’s ok with whatever I think. Even when I directly ask “how do you feel about xyz?” I’m ok with being decision-maker most of the time. But just right now, I don’t know which one of pushing him to quit, or stay and deal, or get a new job is the right way for me to show support? I have my own opinion, but I’m not in his brain, so I don’t WANT to be decision-maker this time. I know he hates change so he also might think the “known enemy” is better than the “unknown.”\n\nI’ve deleted a bunch of stuff, I can respond more in comments ",

While texting was not how i imagined getting asked out, I accepted and we're dating now. \n\nIn the past, he would always say looks didn't matter to him; only personality. I'd ask him \"even if she was super ugly ?\" And he would say he didn't care as long as he liked her personality. I chalked it up to him being a bit overweight, and him wanting girls to only focus on his personality. Still, for this reason, when he asked me out, I felt a little bit hesitant.  I have always struggled with my confidence and feeling attractive. Him asking me out felt like confirming my worst fears-- that I am ugly. Still, he is the nicest guy ever and treats me like princess( even before we were officially dating) which is why I accepted his confession.\n\nIts been a month and we still havent kissed, only held hands/hugged. It is both of our first relationship. The other day, I think he was about to kiss me but i changed the topic and avoided it. When he was leaning in, his words in the past flashed through my mind and all i could think of was how ugly I am. At this point, I dont know how I'll be able to kiss him, considering how I've been feeling. It doesn't help that its my first kiss and i dont really know how to do it.\n\nTl;dr\nMy bf said in the past he didn't care if a girl was ugly if he liked her personality. We were about to kiss, and I suddenly felt extremely unattractive. Now everytime I imagine kissing him I get scared (its also my first kiss).",

Early-ish into our relationship he snapped his controller in half after an online fighting game and showed it to me on FaceTime and a few other things like that before we ever met (other controllers and a hole in the wall a few years ago), i thought it was only small things like that but today he told me he’d broken his table in half because he was mad (presumably at the game again). I’ve never actually seen him do any of these, he’s just texted me about it when they happened but it kind of concerns me. I grew up with an angry father who would throw things when mad and i’m not saying i ever think my boyfriend would do that but i know i’ll be uncomfortable living with him if he breaks things while i’m there. Is there any advice i can get about talking to him about maybe just not doing that anymore?\n\n\nEDIT: If it matters, we’ve been together a year and a half, the only things he broke in that time to my knowledge was the controller and the table",

      "content": "So first thing first. Thank you for reading and hopefully offering a helpful advice!\n\nMy husband is impulsive person, expressing everything, anger, ideas, dreams when and how it comes to him. Totally unbothered by how you feel while listening.\nNo time or place is perfect but he doesn't choose at all.\n He is often triggered and stressed when things don't go his way and gets really loud and has trouble to calm down.\n\n This disrupts my mental state, my concentration and dissregulates me emotionaly. My instant reaction is to become hyper aware of his feelings and offer my support, I feel awful, I pause what I was doing but I am not that agreeable and tooned with his feelings. I have trouble understanding why he needs to make fuss over every trouble he faces.\n\nUsually the things he can expect in toxic work environment or from immature 10yo daughter or disagreeable wife, are the triggers. \n\nHe has low tolerance for frustration.\n Really low. His triggers are results of past or situations he CAN'T change AND/ OR are predictable...\n\nThing about me is that I grew up in toxic, maybe narcissistic family dynamic. I hold myself, I am always calm from outside but feels cut deep without me showing it on my face, I think very hard about every word I say and avoid conflict if possible. I turn to dissociation or gray rocking if things excalate to disrespectful conversation. This is an instinct for me, and very hard to avoid. I need conscious effort to remain calm and not regress to pulling myself away from situation. Im in therapy 〜⁠(⁠꒪⁠꒳⁠꒪⁠)⁠〜\n\nMy husband feels very uncomfortable when I hold myself back and he is trying very much to argue with me about something, but usually I don't have energy because everything I would say wouldn't matter or would be used against me, even my feelings. I feel gaslight when I speak my stance and he wants to argue and persuade me in his POV. \n\nI am aware that things can't be solved without conflict and that conflict is a natural way to express different opinions and that only with mutual respect you can come up with solution or a middle ground. This is what I learned in my marriage but I still have trouble figuring out if there is a solution for our problem. I don't feel heard, appreciated and respected fully.\n\nWhat we can't agree on :\n1. Spending money \n2. Parenting\n3. Sex / offspring \n  \nOur situation is ok financialy. What I mean by that is that we live well, no luxuries, but also no savings. As millennials, let's just say we are grateful we are not in debt, oooh wait we are...😂but we manage.\n\nWe have a 10yo daughter that needs help with school, that we spoiled rotten. She is a lovely person but needs some working habits asap. He can be laud with her also, when he is frustrated with her and she doesn't react like he would like. Effect is opposite of what he wishes for, but his reactions are just that, not a thought through strategy.\n\nLet say I almost made my peace with sexless marriage. This is something I can't even talk about with him because he goes instantly into pity party mode. He starts saying I know I don't express enough how I feel for you, I know I attack your personality when we are in disagreements, and he basically complains instead of me like it's easier to say it himself than listen, really listen what I have to say. He doesn't want to deal with me.\n\nHe often said in past two years that if I am  so unhappy with him I should divorce. This was when I still had strength to argue with him. He said so many little mean things that hurt me deeply that I stopped asking for intimacy, help with chores or understanding about my worries or needs.\n\nAbout a month ago, things excalateed while making a decision about our summer vacation and he said he wants divorce. And while we didn't come to agreement about it I heard his POV , validated his reasoning but pointed out our limitations financially and he lost it. \nLater in the fight he said he doesn't want divorce and he was just frustrated but idk, I was hurt beyond repair at that point. I suspected he felt that way or has that though every time we have a rough time with each other but, idk.\n\nIt's safe to say I am at my wits end and I am seeking solution still because we are in loop that is unhealthy.",

I even find myself looking at old pictures of her and missing her to the point where I feel like crying. It’s weird because our relationship ended badly, with mistakes on both sides. It wasn’t a healthy relationship either, but she was my first real love.\n\nWe both blocked each other after the breakup, and while I’ve unblocked her, I have no way of contacting her, and I assume that’s how she wants it. I respect that.\n\nWhat’s messing with my head is that I miss her so intensely sometimes, but when I’m actually with my current girlfriend, I completely forget about her and feel totally present and in love. It’s like I’m stuck in a loop, revisiting the past emotionally even though I’m committed to someone in the present.\n\nMy question is:\nHow do I finally move on from a first love that ended badly, even when I’m happy in my current relationship?",

      "title": "What should be the boundaries between my BF 25M and his female friend (ex fwb)? I’m a 26F",
      "content": "Hi all, I’m truly confused about the current situation. I’m a 26F and my bf is 25M. We’ve been exclusively dating for almost 9 months and officially together 2 months.\n\nWe both take it quite serious. My bf is rather nerdy and doesn’t have too many friends. Two of his 4/5 close friends used to be his fwb. This was hard for me to accept and I was struggling quite a lot because this is a red flag in my culture but after therapy and talking to my friends I realize it’s ok and I haven’t said anything as long as their conversations are not inappropriate (as in not in a sexual way). \n\nThis particular one ex fwb doesn’t like me ever since my bf met me, and she directly expresses this hatefulness to my bf. I was in a relationship when I met my bf (I cheated on my ex in the end) and this ex-fwb thinks I’m morally corrupt. I broke with my ex soon after that so that I can be with my bf with nothing to hide.\n\nThis ex-fwb doesn’t have ANY other friend except my bf (according to my bf). She’s a local and is 25 as well. I’ve only moved to this country for 3 years and I have more reliable friends than this ex-fwb. I think it does prove that in some way she is incompetent to build normal friendships with people around her. Last week this ex-fwb broke up with her bf, and she called my bf while crying. I feel bad for her but from my bf and my perspective this is destined to happen as her bf has tons of red flags from the beginning. This is a bit annoying but from a logical perspective I chose to empathize this woman instead of making a massive scene with my bf. I talked to my bf expressing my frustration: first, she doesn’t only talk to my bf about issues in her life, she would DM him multiple selfies regularly which is apparently attention seeking (and my bf acknowledges). Secondly, after her life is falling apart, she asks if my bf is at home (my bf stays with me when he’s off work and we normally see each other at the weekend). As a woman I think that’s clear indication of her wanting to meet him in real life alone.\n\nToday she messaged my bf again, asking “can we meet”. My bf says he’s busy to refuse and told me everything which I appreciate a lot. Tbf if it’s just a normal friend I probably wouldn’t mind that much because I do understand that people have their vulnerable moments. However, given their past history and how this female friend is approaching my bf, I feel extremely uncomfortable if they are going to meet alone. I talked to my bf and expressed that I feel upset because this female friend obviously takes my bf as her ONLY safety net. This is ok when he’s single, but now he’s committed to me, it would hurt my feelings if he puts her in such a prioritized position. \n\nI don’t have insecure or trust issues. I know my bf loves me and I love him equally, I don’t doubt that he would choose me over this female friend as a long term partner (she’s broke, lazy and uneducated, particularly she used to be my bf’s ex fwb so that she can stay in my bf’s place for free and that really disgusts me so much whenever I think about it). I wouldn’t force my bf to delete her or stop talking to her, as he’s an independent individual but I really don’t know what to do now. \nI’m an east Asian immigrant working in Europe and idk if it’s the culture difference, but I find it quite hard to accept if this female friend keeps seeking attention from him. Weirdly I don’t hold any similar grudge against my bf’s exes that he talks to occasionally when they discuss financial investment etc. It’s just this particular friend that bothers me and I want to know from an objective perspective what should be the decent boundaries?\n\nApologies if my description is confusing as using English as a second language to explain is a bit challenging!",

I do work full-time from home, and he works a more physically demanding full-time job outside of the home. We both have busy seasons with 15+ hr weekly OT requirements. My job, though remote, requires my full attention and constant work (corporate environment, tons of meetings, have to process at least 60 orders per hour to meet metrics) so I don’t have any time to even really start-to-finish a load of laundry. We are both pretty messy people, so cleaning is a daily must. I do all cooking, all clean up after, all dishes, all laundry, clean kitchen/bathrooms etc. you get the point. I also take full care of our 3 large dogs, and 30 chickens. One of our dogs is currently disabled, so even my breaks are spent walking him and making sure he gets adequate enrichment. \nFor awhile I never complained, and I like to keep busy so it didn’t bother me as much. Now, we want kids someday and a full homestead. He says his goal is to make it so I don’t have to work. I also want this, but don’t see it in the near future, and I just worry that when we do have babies, that will be another thing on ONLY my list. How do I get through to him without being seen as the stereotypical nagging wife? ",

      "title": "Im (29F) not enjoying sex lately with my bf (29M)",
      "content": "Lately, I can't enjoy sex with my partner. Nothing bad is happening, and he really tries to make me enjoy it. But I just can't. I'm going through a tough time with my self-esteem because since I started dating my boyfriend, I've gained a little weight, and my lifestyle (which was very active) has become a bit calmer. He eats very bad, and I honestly haven't had the willpower to stick to my regimen while he's eating hamburgers; I know this is my fault. But the problem is that I don't feel attractive to him, even though he says he loves my body type and that he has always preferred to be with curvy girls like me. For me, this body has always been difficult to inhabit, especially now with the extra pounds I've gained. When we are being intimate, I really can't stop thinking about him hating my rolls or noticing all my imperfections. He says that's not true, but I also think he would be a terrible boyfriend if he said yes, so I feel like he is not being honest. On the other hand, recently we had to go through an abortion and we were far away when that happened and I had to go through the whole process by myself, and although he tried to be kind, I feel that he doesn't even begin to understand how difficult that is for any woman. And it's a topic he never mentions, he never asked me how it was for me. And financially he took responsibility, but emotionally he was very absent. But on the other hand, he has severe ADHD and I feel that being empathetic with the emotions of others has never been his strong ability. But it still makes me sad and especially during sex, I sometimes think I don't want to go through that again and have him be emotionally absent again. And finally, when we first started being together, he just decided to stop following several models on IG and told me 'I want to do this to respect you,' which I thought was very sweet, but later he followed 4 girls and seeing them, I noticed that three of them had very different bodies from mine. This has affected me quite a bit because I don't know, I feel like he wishes I had another body type. Additionally, since we met, we agreed that we wanted to be swingers, but that has also become a problem now because I feel like he doesn't really like it, and I feel like he would change me for any other woman who looked more like the type of girls he followed on IG. He has also told me several times that those girls are just for sex, and that I am wife material, but that doesn't make me feel better because I would like to be both. At the same time, I feel like it's something very strange because I swear to you that I don't see men that way; I am a highly sapiosexual person and what excites me most during sex is the connection, the intimacy, not the body of the other person. I also feel that, in the long run, this is going to affect us in the swinger realm because it's supposed to be about not creating bonds and that everything is just sexual. But well, that's for another subreddit. Anyway, do you think I'm being exaggerated? Any tips on not being so much in my head during sex and being able to enjoy it more? Also any other women that went through an abortion, how are you dealing with that? I would like your opinions in general. Thank for reading. Please be nice. ",

He always shows up for his friends, but when it comes to me, I feel like I’m always the last priority.\n\nDuring my postpartum days, I cried alone in the dark. I asked him to be there for me, he did, but it wasn’t consistent. Behind closed doors, he treats me badly. He sometimes calls me names, and whenever I confront him about his behavior, he reacts harshly.\n\nLately, I’ve been questioning my reality. I don’t even know if he truly loves me or if I still love him. Whenever I ask him to do something, he always turns it around, saying I should take the first step. He claims he’s just reflecting my actions. At this point, I honestly feel used. What are your thoughts about my situation? ",

      "content": "I, 27F, have been in love with my now fiancé, 27M, since the day I met him. It was the classic best friends to lovers trope. We both have had lives that mirrored each other: growing up religious, developing mental illnesses at the same age, going to a Christian college and then breaking from Christianity as a whole around the same time, had similar abuse experiences, developed the same poor coping skills as a teenager (we were both emo as teens so I'm sure you can imagine). We truly feel that we are soulmates. We were best friends for six years before we started dating and hashed out most of our interpersonal problems well before we even started dating. \n\nRight now, our biggest issue is his mother, 65F. \n\nShe doesn't like me. It isn't just that she doesn't like me, she acts like I corrupted her son. I've helped him speak up for himself, become more independent, emotionally healthy. I helped him manage his DID symptoms (he is now in therapy), learn boundaries, and generally boosted his self esteem. In the almost ten years I known him, he is the healthiest I've ever seen him. \n\nHis mother is hard-core Catholic. She initially offered to help pay for our wedding because she knows that I come from a generationally poor background and cannot work due to becoming suddenly disabled as a teenager. But that has changed because of...being poor? We have had close calls with eviction a few times, but always manage to pull it out in the end. We've sold gaming stuff, done crowd funding, and do anything we can to make ends meet. This never causes a problem in our relationship btw, he knew about my financial background well before we started dating and has never once judged me or held it against me. I've even told him that he can leave me if he wants someone that can offer him more than I can with a clean break, no hard feelings but he CHOSE to stay. His mom on the other hand has offered now for the second time for him to move back in with his parents. This would also mean that I move back in with mine so that he can save up money until we can afford to live together because she feels bad that he has to work so hard. We never asked them to help with money for rent aside from cosigning a loan because of the first close call with eviction and she has said that she will not offer us any help because \"it isn't like we're married.\" It is my firm opinion that she wants to split us up physically to drive a wedge between us. I'm a lot different from past people he has dated. I'm loud, opinionated, laugh too hard at my own jokes, and speak my mind. I am as authentic as possible, so really what you see is what you get and I wouldn't have it any other way. His mom is a covert narcissist who puts on a show to be perceived as a god fearing meek woman that keeps to herself and pretty much doesn't speak unless spoken to. I've tried to talk to her using her own language, Volume, tone, and mannerisms she talked to me with and she took an issue with it. It's funny that she cornered me to talk to me when my fiancé wasn't there but when I spoke my mind she would no longer get speak to me about the subject unless my fiancé was there lol.\n\nMy fiancé and I are both at a loss and I give up. I wouldn't be surprised if we end up going no contact in the future. It sort of sounds like she doesn't like him being independent because he doesn't need her as much. \n\nHow can I get her to see that I'm not some whore of Babylon and that my fiancé chose to be with me? \n\nTL;DR Catholic mom hates her son's fiancé that she deems as less than someone her son should be with.",

Painful as it was, I took solace in seeing her happy start dating the guy she’d later marry - I’m very pleased for her. Same story during my college years a few years later with a different girl. I suppose after all that I shut off. This was 6 years ago and I’ve never felt any such way towards a girl since. I’ve tried to date, but I think there’s something inside a little broken. I’m in compassion therapy to work on being nicer to myself, maybe this will help!\n\nI suppose I find it odd that I can meet beautiful, intelligent women, get on well but not feel that same feeling I’d felt those years ago. I wish I could and I can’t explain why (besides looking inwards and exploring to see if it’s a general ennui that’s doing it). I’m a little detached from life in general, going through the motions. Working, seeing friends, playing sports.

We would see each other 2x per week and a few messages every day, but it was slowly decreasing from there to where some days would have pretty much no messages. There was also tension surrounding a specific grooming habit, ie, his facial hair was distractingly long and even once had food stuck in it when he came over.I have been asking him to please reconsider the break up, as the relationship has been amazing otherwise, we seemed super compatible in bed and have numerous crossed interests. I integrated into his friend group easily. I sincerely enjoyed his family. \n\nHis responses have been that he believes I will find someone better for myself, that he isn't sure he wants to date anyone, he doesnt want kids (I do not either) or to ever get married (being together would be enough for me). That he may need a couple years alone. He said he will cherish the relationship memories, and he is still down to be friends. \n\nHow do I navigate this in a way that could end up with us being together ? Is there any possible hope here ? Our relationship was so cute and I had one of the best years of my life, with him by my side. I have dated quite a lot of people and I am serious when I believe he is the one for me.

      "content": "I have a friend Wilma (34) who has been with her boyfriend Fred (35) for 1.5 years. Wilma came from a mindset, that many millennials have, that we didn't realize there was another path in life other than getting engaged, married and then having kids. I honestly feel the same, I was never told it's what you have to do but I just assumed it was how life would go.\n\nWhen Wilma first met Fred, he explained that he has no interest in ever having kids and that his opinion would never change. His previous long term relationship broke down because his ex thought she could change his mind. Wilma, when deciding whether to date him, realized that at this time in her life she felt neither the pull to have kids or not have kids. They're very compatible and are very happy where they are right now. She said if he confirmed his intentions were to continue to live the life they currently have traveling, adventuring, etc she would be happy living her life without kids. She told him at the moment that she is ok with no having kids.\n\nWilma recently brought up to me that she mentioned in a joking manner to Fred that they should consider moving in together. Fred said something along the lines of 'if you know you absolutely don't want kids in the future'. The issue is that 'at this moment, at 34, she is ok with not having kids but questions if she'll suddenly have the pull to have kids between now and when she's no longer able to. He also refuses to consider an apartment because 'it's throwing away money that doesn't go toward anything'. She doesn't want to buy a house with someone she has never lived with previously. I don't know how this would work but someone would obviously someone need to compromise.\n\nIt's a hard situation because they're so great together and she loves him a lot. But I think they're being unfair to each other possibly. I think it's potentially wasted time for Wilma and Fred. She can't just put her life on hold until she figures out what she wants because she might be completely fine with not having kids. People have kids well into their 40s so she still has a ton of time (although it can be harder to conceive). If she leaves and decides she's actually fine with not having kids, she could miss out on a great life with him. But it's not fair to hold onto him if she doesn't know. I also don't think it's smart of him to date anyone who doesn't have the same thoughts about being child free as he does. Thoughts on how to give her advice?",

      "content": "So long story short we were in a long distance relationship for about a year. Throughout that relationship we had several opportunities of us meeting (he came to my city and then flew back to London and so on). Everytime we tried to meet, things came up (sickness,his fear of seeing me,…etc.)\n\nTo be fair i could have been better, i was often back and forth not knowing if i really wanted this to begin with. He moved really fast with all the loving thing without even meeting and i kind of just fell into it. But eventually i completely gave into it and started to develop real strong feelings.\n\nBut he still didnt see me even after coming to my city and staying there for months in a hotel. His reason? He feared me and was scared that i would leave him (as i said i was often back and forth and tried to do so). I did leave him then but was so attached that we both came always back too each other (this is most likely my karma i am an idiot).\n\nSo my problem right now is that he again moved from the hotel now in an apartment 5 mins away from my house. Have me met yet? No. I grew so much resentment and hatred towards him that the only option for me is to leave regardless of it being my fault mostly. And i told him that on so many occasions multiple times.\n\nBut he won’t let me. He threatenes me for wanting to leave telling me he’ll expose everything (pics,messages,call recordings) towards my friends/family or now a new one, getting a lawyer for harassment? He says he will show them a bunch of call recordings of me being “abusive”. Look ik i have my temper but i don’t lose it for no reason i am not an angry person normally so i don’t understand if that’s even possible. \n\nAll in all idk what to do. I need to study for a very important exam to get into my dream uni and his ultimatum is “ik you want to leave but first you will come see me, go on a couple of dates with me and let me be a part of your success. You owe me that and you made me become this way. Otherwise i will do what i always threatened to do.”\n\nI am losing my sense of self. I know i have been at times not fair to him, but he always tells me how selfish i am, why nobody likes me, why my family dislikes me. Which i am confused about because they don’t?\nMy soul screams from the inside telling me to run away, but idk how, i am scared what he might do and also scared that this will heavily impact my progress in studying by staying. \n\nMy family doesn’t know about him because i wasn’t willing to tell them about a man i haven’t met in person yet, so i don’t really have anyone to talk to about this, besides well…him.\nAlso a lot of this is my fault, i had opportunities to leave and i didn’t take them so you guys don’t have to tell me that one.\nHonestly any advice would help me.\n",

Hot, young, sweet, wants to have my babies, and loves me more and better than I could ever deserve or hope for. Only Problem is I’m just not in love. And it kills me. Half or more of the time we spend together I feel disassociated. When she says sweet things I die inside bc I can’t return the same sentiment genuinely. She knows all this and is so understanding about it. I promises her I’d start therapy next week and have an appointment, my goal is to figure out if I truly just am not in love or if it’s an emotional block due to ptsd from my time in Afghanistan w/ the Marines (emotional disconnection is a symptom). Like when we’re apart I don’t miss her, when there’s movies or love songs it’s never her that comes to mind. I feel it’s a huge disservice to her as she wants to get married and have a future but I just can’t get on board. A part of me wants to be single again and enjoy the distractions I used to chase. But that’s to easy, no personal growth that way. Plus what good will it do to lead on more women while I’m incapable of feeling emotional. Idk if I’m fearful or dismissive avoidant but I 100% am and I try to recognize and work against it. When I look at her I see a wife, the best wife a man could ever want, but I don’t see MY WIFE if that makes sense. Probably a million other factors that I’ll uncover in therapy but for now venting on Reddit will have to do. ",

      "content": "So, the situation, me[33M] was with my ex gf[28F] on and off for nearly three year relationship. Each time we broke up it was over miscommunication via text. Fast forward, start of this year we agreed to slowly grow into a relationship and it was going great, trips, meals out etc. However, a couple of weeks ago she started to become a little cold and distant, so I just politely asked what’s going on? And she goes off. Saying she wants to be alone and needs to work on herself. Being the third time we’ve separated, I gave up. \n\nKey ingredient I missed out during each split, which lasted between a week to a month she would revisit her old fuck buddy (who is madly in love with her). But it always resulted in her reaching out to me. \n\nToday, she came over for a chat and I finally got some truth to her inconsistent behaviour. While with me she always had the FB in the back of her mind. So I asked do you love him, Answer: no. do you see a future with him, Answers again: no. Asked the same questions about myself and she answered yes to both without hesitation. Saying things like you are the only person who has ever helped me. \nAsked other questions in regard to her thought process and kept getting the same answer: I don’t know. It’s too complicated. \n\nMy confusion lies in the fact she says she loves and wants a family, we started looking at houses and planning for the future with me but then wants to leave. \n\nHer dilemma is that she doesn’t know why she thinks about him but wants to speak to him because she’s never given him a chance, but then says she doesn’t see him that way. \n\nI think I’m being naive to the situation but my gut feeling is that once she goes and has this “chat” she’s going to choose him over me. She joked with me when I was hurting the most this afternoon “maybe I can have two fuck buddies”. Felt like a stab in the chest over and over again. \n\nI’ve never been like this before because most separations from an ex has been clean and healthy. but I’m feeling that she’s getting a kick out of this because she has two men fighting over her. \n\nShe says that wishes that this situation never happened and that choosing him or me isn’t black and white. She also says that she will always think “What if”. \n\n",

      "content": "This is going to be long, sorry about that, also this is my first reddit post. I 34 year old woman, have been best friends with Maya 32 female for 16 years. Maya and I have lived together (we do not live in the US btw), studied together, have been there for each other during our best and worst years of our lives. We used to talk on the phone every single day, I always made a joke that it is worse than having a boyfriend. We had so many friends in common and our lives were entertwined.\n\nMaya and I have always been different, I'm more carefree, adventurous and ambitious, while Maya was more settled down, wanted to build a family, likes stability... However, that never stopped us from being there for each other without any judgement, and appreciating our differences, she used to ground me, and I used to bring fun stories to her life.\n\nThat, until about 2 to 3 years ago, I started therapy, and was on anti depressants and anti anxiety meds, Maya never approved of this, as she is not a big believer in the need for therapy. Since I started progressing, I was happy to share with her my developments and the things I discuss with my therapist, that's when she started giving me advice, the advice turned to judgement, and the judgement turned to toxicity.\n\nFor example gaslighting me about who I am, and what I like (remembering the old me from 16 years ago), telling me that therapy is not helping me because I'm manipulating my therapist, she would also disaprove of my life choices, and decisions, such as relationships...\n\nThen when I was feeling bad at work and wanted to move, she would tell me that I can't find better, and that where I am is pretty good, it was so bad that I believed her. When I found a new job I liked, I wanted to take 2 weeks rest between the two jobs, and she was like \"now that you finally found a job you want to act spoiled? go to your new job you are lucky you found one\"\n\nOne thing to note is that I have a very successful career, I worked very hard for it. Maya and I started the same, but her lack of ambition didn't take her far in life (I tried so many times to get her interviews, I tried helping her learn english so she can find better jobs...), so now we have completely different financial situations. I'm mentioning this because my other friends said it might be part of the reason behind the fall out\n\nOne day, I was at her place with her roomate and a mutual friend, and she brought up my relationship with my father, saying that I should forgive him, I was crying and telling her she doesn't know cause she didn't live my life, she kept insisting and gaslighting me saying even her dad is the same and unvalidating my feelings, which encourged the other two women to also comment about my life, it destroyed me.\n\nThe next day, after speaking to my therapist, I sent her a message saying I felt judged and hurt and I didn't appreciate her talking about my life. we had a calm period of time, but there was a bit of tension in the air.\n\nAfter that, I noticed that she never lifts me up, only puts me down. When I would talk about good things a bf did for me, she would say \"and what did you do for him? you are just manipulating him\". When I say I got this good news at work, she would say \"don't go and ruin it again\", always shifts everything to be negative or to show me that she understands the situation better.\n\nA few weeks later, I went on a trip abroad with my sports team, and it was a disaster (story for another time), we were two teams, male and female, and we ended up splitting into two, half of the girls and half of the boys came with me, and the rest stayed with the team. We were really traumatised and we all trauma bonded, in there I got close to a guy, let's call him Derrick, 22 years old\n\nI know what yall think about age gap relationships, but honestly even for me, this came out of nowhere.\n\nWhen we got back home I started getting ready to leave my job and my city, and I organised my farewell party, during this time, Derrick and I were seeing each other. I gathered different friend groups, my girlies, my gay friends, and my friends from the sports team. Right from the start, Maya barely said hi to the guys from my team, we sat in a big table, and she is talking to everyone except those guys (they were 3 of them). The rest of my friends were speaking to them, that part at least was nice.\n\nSo I took a first step to break the ice and I told her \"aren't you going to tell Derrick about all our stories as you normally do?\", she had a fake smile on her face, so I didn't insist. A few min later, Derrick went out of the bar, and Maya told me: \"he is veryyy young\", to that I said, \"yeah, but he is the same age as Dave, my friend sitting next to you\".\n\nHer response was \"Dave doesn't look young\", so I asked \"so what is the problem? is that he is young or that he looks young?\", she looked annoyed and didn't answer\n\nAfter a somwhat fine time at the bar, we decided to go to a club, after all it's my last night in my city. Not everyone was able to go with us, so we ended up just me, Maya, another female friend, Derrick and 2 other male friends from the sports team.\n\nOn our way to the club, the girls went in my car, while the guys were in another car. In my car, Maya kept saying that he was too young and I said \"aren't you happy for me that I'm treated in a really good way, he takes good care of me\", to this she said \"any 22 year old guy will take good care of you because you are older\". I didn't know what to say to this, what does it mean? I don't deserve to be treated well unless it is a younger guy who doesn't know better?\n\nOnce in the club, the situation was tense! Maya is very known in this club, everyone knows her, all her friends (that we don't have in common) come here. I was trying to get everyone to have fun together but the girls and the guys couldn't mix up, so I would go from a group to another and have fun with both. At some point I was next to Maya and she tells me \"if you kiss him in this club I will kill you\", I was really shocked, and I thought she was joking, so I reminded her of a time she was kissing her bf in an emergency room, and she tells me, \"this is different, this is p\\*\\*\\*philia\" I was shocked...\n\nI grabed my bag and left\n\nWe didn't speak for a while, until we had to meet for a mutual friend's event, during it, Maya pretended nothing happened, she was trying to speak to me, and even wanted to give me her make up. Since those couple of days back in December we haven't spoken since.\n\nAbout a month ago, she posted a meme on instagram saying: \"Admit you are wrong or move to the moon\", and it's a picture of a cat drinking tea on the moon. That for me was a clear message she will never apologise, and will never admit being wrong\n\nThere are so many other stories where I was judged and billittled, I didn't want to write everything here to not overwhelm you\n\nOur friends in common say I should let it go and forgive her, but I don't feel like it\n\n ",

      "content": "Hello everyone!\n\nFirst of all, please forgive me for my English as it's my second language. So here's my issue and I don't know how to deal with it and support my girlfriend. So, my girlfriend went through an abortion 2 years ago (1 month old pregnancy), because of unplanned pregnancy. She was on medication, but somehow still got pregnant. We were only a year into our relationship at the time (she is my first girlfriend), so we both discussed about abortion. I didn't force her in anyways to go through it, and we just discussed the pros and cons of going through the childbirth at the time. Cons were more than pros, and my girlfriend decided to go through with the abortion. But soon after abortion, she went into post-abortion trauma, and she started to self-blame and saying that \"she did a mistake. she killed a child\"....and so on. I did my best to support her, and I constantly told her that she did nothing wrong and it was best for the baby as we wouldn't be able to take care of the child in our current situation. She seems understanding, but slowly it has turned into her blaming me for everything. She blames me for not being financially well and therefore she had to kill her baby because I wasn't able to take care of her, I'm heartless and so on. And every once in a while when she's drunk, she remembers the abortion and starts crying and then blaming herself. Then she sometimes have dreams of a child and assumes that it's her child who she killed, who came into her dreams and was talking to her. Then she is all depressed all over again.\n\nI always try to support her, and be understanding. But after 2 years of going through this and having arguments due to this almost once a month, I feel she's not ready to move forward in life. I tried talking to her to get some help, like talking to a psychiatrist, but she's never seems to want to go and talk about it to anybody else. She thinks if other people or her family member knew about it, they'll think she's did something wrong and god needs to punish her for it.\n\nAnother thing, which I think is very important that I should mention is that she's buddhist and in her religion, abortion is considered a sin.\n\nI'm seeking advice on how to support her and help her get over it. Honestly, I feel tired now. Sometimes I would be working on an important project, when she would have this episode and starts talking to me about the abortion. I can't focus on my work, and if I tell her to give me 30 minutes and I'll be free and have time to talk with her (more like have another argument), she starts tell me \"I'm heartless\", \"You don't understand a mother's pain\", \"Only I can feel the pain\"...and so on.\n\nPlease share some advice.",

      "content": "I 30F, got engaged to my long term boyfriend 32M in December 2024.\nDuring June 2024, he had moved to another city for his career. And we are in a LDR situation since a year.\n\nBG : \nI belong to a Middle Class family, not rich but have some savings, my family too has some assets and a stable life. I earn decent too.\nMy fiancé comes from poverty and has raised his life upto where he is. He or his parents doesn't own any assets or house or anything. No savings too.\nLiving paycheck to paycheck , cause of his financial  responsibilities to his parents.\nI knew about all this, but he is a good person by heart, kind , loves me, takes care about the smallest things. We know each other since a decade so decided to get married.\n\nNow coming to the present day:\nSince the time he has moved out of the city, his behavior has changed. \n- He seems very busy. There's no time difference issue between our cities. We hardly get to communicate properly. He has immersed himself in his work and then in his free time hanging out with office buddies. Coming home late and then going to sleep cause of being dead tired. Weekends too some or the other story.\n- Have asked him to remove time for us sincerely since we are in LDR. But it doesn't happen regularly\n- He has become forgetful about the relationship and me. No longer takes efforts for anything.\n- He isn't even helping me in the wedding plans. Whenever we talk about it , it causes him anxiety because of financial issues. But says we will manage it cause he wants this. Since he is not here, I am taking care of making wedding arrangements.\n- He is financially irresponsible. Even his family. They have these poor habits of spending, no budgeting , debt issues and are always cribbing that they have no money and need more. When he is earning well, as well as his brother who supports the family. Have tried to sit with him millions of times to follow budget & explain money rules, savings, etc. But it never successfully happens. It did one time, but he broke the savings for some family needs.\n- He has also borrowed money from me, and has not returned it back to me. It's been more than a year now.\n- There are no romantic gestures like he used to do before. Literally zero. Now that we are in LDR, there are no dates too and whenever he comes to visit, it's very short and we don't get anytime to do anything. Max he does is send 2-3 chocolates once in 3-4 months.\n- He doesn't even pay attention to his health or his family communication. Citing that he is busy.\n\nI feel that relationship & marriage are no longer his priorities in life. And he is dragging me along and I am resenting his non-chalant behavior towards me. I feel he takes me for granted. That I am always here and not leaving. I am a very responsible person and I keep a balance between all the aspects of my life. For me, his lack of efforts in everything else except work is disturbing. How can someone live like this at this age?\n\nI have communicated this to him and his reasons are always the same that he loves me and wants a future with me & that's why he is busy making a good career. And that I am his priority, to just hold for some more time for his career to get better.\n\nI want to know whether this happens normally in a relationship and has anyone experienced it?",

      "content": "My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half now. When we first started dating, I was in the best shape of my life, and he said that he ‘used to’ go and was strict about his diet with no alcohol or vaping. \nWe moved in together and live across from the gym I go to and I have asked him all year to go with me. He says that he would but always gets defensive and refuses to go when the time comes. He is very tall- 6’5” so he looks skinny with clothes but he’s pretty out of shape, he doesn’t have any muscle and he’s flabby with boobs. He’s also a very insensitive person that has the nerve to make fun of people that are not attractive or not fit. All of that bothers me and I feel like he’s been knocking me way off track. When he gets out of work he mainly games and naps for sometimes 2 hours at a time.\n\nAlso, he is a messy guy I have to repeat for him to put his shoes away almost every day, and he would leave trash right by the trash can. His areas are always unorganized. I should’ve known when I saw his room at his mom’s house the first time it stunk and there was trash and clothes everywhere. The floor wasn’t visible.\n\nHe has a temper, doesn’t know how to talk through disagreements without raising his voice/yelling and cursing. I am just so tired of that. \nHe would also say mean things all the time when he’s mad and I would tell him I need an apology. He apologizes but things repeat itself.\n\nI love to travel, and we haven’t even gone on a trip just us 2. He only prioritized it when his friends went too and whenever I found a deal, he ignored it. I said I should just travel by myself. And he said “GO TRAVEL BY YOURSELF THEN” many times.\nAnd that’s what ended up happening this past weekend. I went on a trip by myself because it’s been a year and we haven’t gone anywhere. He didn’t want me to go and got mad at me. I got so much attitude even though he was supposed to take that time off. I feel like I’m losing bits of myself and he is dulling my spirit.\n\nMy mom and dad separated when I was 5, so I was raised a single mom although I used to be a daddy’s girl. For a year she’s been having cardiac issues and that caused me to have a more intense state of depression and anxiety and he was not understanding of that. When I expressed myself after having drinks and was emotional he yelled at me and told me to stop drinking. Eventually he became understanding but it took over a year and he had to hear that my brother was suffering from the same thing.\n\nThen I found out my dad just had a heart attack and had kidney failure yesterday. I told him about it and the first thing he said was, “weren’t you not that close to him anyways?”\nHe proceeded to game and let me cry by myself and checked on me periodically.\nHe’s so insensitive and tells me I’m too sensitive. The person I feel I need the most isn’t really there for me. \n\nHe constantly tells me he loves me, I know he wouldn’t cheat on me and my family thinks that he’s the best option for me, given that I’m getting older. I just am starting not to feel the same. I think I’m falling out of love and I’m starting to feel resentment. I don’t even want to be intimate anymore.\n\nProblem is I am insecure now and I don’t know if I can get better because I don’t feel as in shape anymore, he told me not to use my retainers anymore so my teeth are no longer straight, I began having hair loss and my skin has been terrible because of stress and seborrheic dermatitis. \n\nAre all of these things deal breakers?\nSorry it’s a long one but I appreciate anyone that gets through it.\n",

      "content": "\nFor context, I am from Delhi, India and he is from Hamburg, Germany. We met online in January this year, and immediately clicked. It was the first time ever I felt so strong about someone, much less online. Soon enough, we got serious and have been in a committed relationship from the last couple months. Things are great, for the most part of it. He makes me happy, loved and cherished. I make sure to be just as available and reciprocative with my feelings with him. We haven't lagged in our communication anywhere until now - him being the greater force to get us there even. \n\nBut the problem is, I carry too much of an emotional and mental baggage with me, coming from a conservative and relatively orthodox family. I am constantly under extreme pressure to give my best, both at home and at college, academically. Apart from that, there have been other personal instances which make me who I am today.\n\nI cry too often when alone and have no other exit to vent my pent up frustration. My thoughts get jumbled, messy and ugly. \n\nEver since I started talking to my current bf, the episodes were at bay - until very recently, when everything started coming crashing down on me once again. I constantly feel depressed and tired. I try my best to contain it for as long as I can before ending up a sobbing mess. And the fact I cannot physically hold my bf during times like is these, is so goddang draining. I miss him so much. \n\nSo, no matter how hard I try to not text him, I end up doing just that and venting about the whole scenario, all while being an emotional mess. And being the most supportive and emotionally available person in my life, he listens to it all without a single strain of contempt in his tone. And even though there is not much of an input to my vent, he makes sure to let me know that he's there for me in any way can be present. And just the thought of it, makes me feel a little less shitty and less lonely about the whole ordeal. \n\nI think I have been getting a little too selfish with it because I have stopped putting in the efforts to stop myself from reaching out to him during times like these. Instead, I hold on to the little comfort his words and voice provide me with. And even though, he hasn't shown me a single ounce of annoyance, I fear I am burdening him with my baggage. I'm scared that one day, he might get tired of me and my problems. \n\nLooking at our dynamic from a third person's perspective sheds the light on how problematic this whole relationship sounds with me being heavily depends on him for my emotional and mental health but I can't seem to bring myself to act on any sort of solution. I cannot get therapy any time soon as I am still very much dependent on my parents for all my financial needs. I don't have many friends I can talk to about my problems. I regrettably suck at anything which might help me sustain myself financially. I just feel stuck, in general. And I think I might drag my bf down with my shit too. \n\nHe's so gentle and kind with me. He has been the same way since day one. Everything about him speaks love to me and makes my heart does flipbacks everytime. I'm very foreign to being listened and loved but he has been hell bent to turn that experience all the way around. \n\nHow do I handle something which feels as complex as this? \n\nI don't want to let him go. I don't even know what I'd say to break us off like that. But I know that what I'm doing is not healthy for him, nor is it healthy for our relationship.",

      "content": "I’d like to preface this with I am not a Karen and have never had issues with service workers in the past prior to this. I have a small door mail box and get spam mail every day, sometimes it got too full. My mail carrier has always had passive aggressive responses to this, shoving mail in my doorway, or knocking aggressively and waiting for me to answer for an abnormal amount of time. I have depression and have mostly avoided the conflict by not answering the door. One day she knocked on my door to let me know my cat wanted to come inside my apartment. I felt like this was strange and crossed a line. I got another aggro knock the next day, I didn’t answer but mostly emptied my mailbox. I called the postal service and complained. The next day I received a notice to fully empty the mailbox or service would be suspended. There were only 4 letters in there but I fully emptied it to comply. Since then has been 3 months of postal hell. I didnt receive mail for all of March, most of April, few things in May, nothing now. Initially my mail carrier was lying to the post office and saying my mail box was full. I’ve spoken to every supervisor for weeks. Eventually two supervisors came with all my mail from over a month and banged on my door very loudly. I complained to Usps again because I thought it was this crazy carrier but the complaint went directly to the supervisors responsible and they called me back and scolded me like middle schoolers and said “No we didnt knock too loud.” So now Ive lost a decent amount of credibility and they sympathize with her and tell me to make sure the mail box is empty and scold me for complaining about knocking. In retrospect I regret that but we’re going on 3 months now of no mail now. I’ve been told this issue is resolved multiple times by supervisors but it is not. I spoke to a supervisor this morning who told me my carrier is deliberately going against the rules and refusing to deliver my mail. He said that after a few warnings he will eventually report it to the higher ups and eventually I will get mail delivery but with no specific time line. I obviously should have just been nicer to my mail carrier in the first place and have my regrets. But it’s crazy to me that this person is holding such a long term grudge and committing a postal crime over one complaint. We have not spoken to each other this whole time. If anyone has any advice on what I should do please let me know.",

      "content": "We've been dating for almost 5 months, He's really nice and treats me great but I started to realize how much he seeks attention. I feel as if he always has to relate in every conversation no matter who or what it is. He will turn conversations into about him, talk over people. His friend and I had to say to him a few times the other night \"hey, I was talking\". He called me the other night and told me about something that happened and he told me the same story a few times in different ways, I had the feeling he was just trying to show off and wanted me to say \"wow you're so cool\" but I don't feed into that stuff. No one is perfect and this is my only issue with him. How can I approach this without being a jerk?",

      "content": "We've been together for about 3.5 years. He just turned 30 and I'm in my mid 20's. The relationship between his family and I hasn't been the best since the start.\n\nSome background info: we're from the same continent just different countries. Both live in the U.S and speak our mother tongue and English. Growing up I never really had issues making friends or getting along with others. I'm a mix of introverted/extroverted. If you ask my friends, they'd describe me as overall friendly. Never has issues with other families I've been around.\n\nFrom the beginning I never really felt welcome. His family gatherings are always 15+ people, obviously everyone has known each other since the minute they were born so they mostly talk among themselves. The way that I see it - the family should try to get to get to know the new person. Apparently my boyfriend thinks it's the other way around.\n\nAs I mentioned above, nobody really tried to get to know me the first 2-3x I was around them. So I took it upon myself to try to get to know them by asking them questions about their life (job, hobbies, etc). It didn't' take long for me to realize that after I was done trying to get to know them, the conversation died out. I can't remember a single time when they asked a question about me. Over time I started being more and more quiet. At this point I don't try to initiate conversations anymore with anyone because I already know how that's going to go. I recently switched careers and I've mentioned it in passing as I try to engage in small talk. They don't ask how my studies are going, or anything along those lines...\n\nWhen my partner tries to invite me to family gatherings 9 times out of 10 I am really not trying to attend. The way I see it wether I show up or not - it doesn't matter! I might as well just me an inanimate object in the room because I'm pretty sure that's how his family sees me.\n\nI've brought these issues up to him but he insists that I should try harder. I am soooo over trying, I am NOT one to kiss ass. I will always be authentically me wether people like it or not. He's extremely close to his family, I sometimes wonder if there's a point in keeping the relationship going since I'll never be able to connect with his family the way he wants me to. Has anyone every been in a similar predicament? Did u fix it or did you decide to move on?",

Since then I have been calling and checking up on him occasionally. But I am wondering if he really does have cancer because of some red flags. I feel terrible for thinking that but things are not adding up. He said that he had surgery very recently. I asked to see any documentation of hospital visits or surgery, his patient portal, emails, medications he has to take, or even the name of his surgeon. He said that he throws away all the papers immediately after visits because it makes him upset to see. He doesn’t have his patient portal set up. His friend supposedly takes care of all the paperwork and his meds for him so he doesn’t know. He claims he doesn’t remember the name of his surgeon and only gave a vague description. I have lost family members to cancer. It’s devastating. I want to believe and support him as a friend if he does have cancer. How can I verify this?\n",

      "title": "My [25M] mother [56F] won't let me travel alone, even if I'm travelling to see a friend. How can I resolve this?",
      "content": "Hi Reddit,\n\nI'm from the UK and I have a dear friend who I'd like to visit in another country in Europe. It would be my first time travelling abroad on my own which is definitely intimidating (and I am a fairly anxious person!) but I feel that this trip would really boost my confidence and help me develop some much-needed self reliance.\n\nUnfortunately, the biggest obstacle is my mother. She is completely opposed to me travelling on my own and has even tried to put me off making solo trips within the UK. I went on a day trip to another city a few months ago and in the days beforehand she repeatedly, and very pointedly, reminded me that if I didn't go she'd refund me the train tickets. I did go, and I was absolutely fine of course.\n\nShe has never really explained her reasoning but she clearly a) doesn't think I'm mature enough to handle it and b) fears something bad will happen. She has always been a fearful person, for example she will avoid crowded city centres because she fears terrorist attacks.\n\nThe last time we actually had an argument about this she told me she'd disown me if I went on a trip without her permission. Which would likely mean me being thrown out of the family home which I would prefer to avoid - I want to stay at home and save rather than get caught in the rent trap. I also have very very few friends local to me so my family is all I have.\n\nMy dad and (also an adult) sister are in the picture, but my dad generally just lets her get what she wants because it's easier and she makes his life hell when he stands up to her or does something she doesn't like.\n\nDisowning me would be a red line for my dad though and I think they'd end up divorcing over it.\n\nAt the end of the day it's stupid - I have a job, I earn my own money so I should be able to go where I like. But I feel completely unable to do so because I don't want to completely implode my family and make everyone's life (including my own) hell for a year or more. In that sense, travelling feels selfish as my dad and my sister will bear the brunt of my mum's outbursts whilst I'm gone.\n\nIt's worth noting, for additional context, that my mum has been a massively overprotective helicopter parent my entire life and has never attempted to teach me any adult life skills, everything I've learned I've had to teach myself. So if she feels I'm not mature enough to travel by myself, it's at least partly her own fault.\n\nI would very much like to do the trip - even though travelling alone is scary - but I also don't want to tear my family apart. I would appreciate any help or advice I can get.",

      "content": "My gf (F22) and I (M21) have been together for a year and there’s been some great moments but a lot of bad ones as well. Recently, my gf has been going out a lot late at night with her “friends”. She had made friends with this guy. (Let’s call him Liam) and I was already wary of him as he was liking all of her Instagram posts and highlights.\n\nOne day, she’s on her way to my house and she has to stop to help him because his motorcycle breaks down. I call to ask her if she’s still coming over but she sends me to voicemail all night from 6pm to 3 am and she would only respond to my texts once every few hours. I was pissed. One day, I check Liam’s  instagram and I see a picture of her hand in his lap. She told me that he asked her to put it there, and she went ahead and did it. Later she switched up and said that the guy put her hand there instead. This story was so unbelievable it’s insane. It became harder to trust her especially because of a pattern she’s had with being truthful in the past.\n\nA couple weeks later, she tells me that she’s going to cook with some of her some of her girls at her friends house. Let’s call her J. At this point, I had lost all trust in her so I decided to hire a private investigator. Yes I know it may be invasive but I needed to know the truth. The PI pulled up to her house and followed her. She never went to J’s house and it turns out she went to Liam’s house and he drove her car to a vape shop and then they went to a bar together. I put a stop to the whole operation. I called her and she sent me to voicemail but texted me saying that she was still with J. But I told her that was wrong and she was out with Liam. Then she switched up and said that she’s with Liam at J’s house but she had just left the bar. I told her we were done then she pulled up to my house begging and crying for me to stay but she still lied saying that she went to J’s house. She did admit to hanging out with Liam because I showed her the video evidence. She said it was wrong hanging out with him alone but she said she wasn’t doing anything and they were grabbing drinks. I was not okay with this and she knows this type of behavior isn’t something I’m okay with.\n\nShe also said that a couple other guy friends were gonna pull up to the bar but it didn’t happen because she had to leave the bar early due to a fight breaking out. She keeps saying that she loves me and nothing bad happened but it’s hard to believe her at this point. She refuses to cut the guy off too. She expects me to stay in the relationship while she maintains contact with the guy. I just don’t know how to process all of this",

Especially because he had brought up exclusivity early on, and constantly gave me the impression that this was something real. He'd say he missed me, that I was a positive force in his life, and that our time together was meaningful. But when things started to deepen, he shut down. On his birthday, I called him sad and emotional and he coldly said, “You have the whole summer to get over it.”\n\nLater, he thanked me for the birthday gift and said, “The man who ends up with you is lucky.” But that honestly just stung more.\n\nIt’s been tough processing everything.\n\nWas I just a soft place for him to land after his divorce? Did I mistake effort for emotional availability?",

      "content": "23 F who was dating 27 M. Dated officially for about 5 months but knew each other for 7 months. Incredibly passionate relationship and we both agreed that is was something we have never felt. We broke up officially yesterday, but I found a hinge notification last Thursday. He lied about it to my face the day I found it, as well as on Sunday when I confronted him with a screen recording of his profile.\n\nYesterday he came to get his things, and we talked. We talked for 2 hours. First about the lies, and the possible cheating (which he acknowledges he emotionally cheated but is dying on the hill that he never met up or actually did anything with anyone, which I have no proof of).\n\nWe then talked about the relationship in general. How we didn't have much of a foundation, we had a rocky start, and how we didn't really have many vulnerable talks that led to us sharing our true emotions.\n\nHe lost his job, moved home, and is job searching now. We both agreed that he really isn't in a place to have a partner right now- he can't give me the time and energy I deserve- let alone help build back the trust and foundation we lost when he lied and got hinge.\n\nHe spoke of unconditional love, how he wishes we could work through this, especially if we are meant to be. He told me this weekend and last night- I am the only woman he wants in his life, and for the rest of his life. I told him that if this is true, then he will work on himself. Not only will he get a job, but he will get an apartment, move back here, not see other people until then, and most of all get to the bottom of his trauma as to why he downloaded hinge for validation from others.\n\nWe left in a seemingly positive place. But this morning i awoke with unnerving anxiety in my body. The relationship is over right now. and we agreed to no contact, which hurts because I miss him. But at the same time, he lied to me, so I need space. **But, we mutually agreed we love each other and would only want to be together if we work on ourselves and are in better places.** \n\nI worry that he will not change for us, for me, and for himself. That what he said is a lie too. **How do I move on with my life, but also keep him in mind? Do I believe what he says to me about the future, or do I pretend like its fake and move forward?**\n\nMy self esteem is so low right now. I feel myself wanting to reach out (its only been a day) and just be held by him again, even though he hurt me. I still love him, and want to believe in a future where we can have the relationship we both wanted/had for a short time before these life circumstances and his lies. \n\nCan I work on myself while having absolutely no contact with him, with the idea that we will mutually reconnect someday? Or do I have to give that idea up? \n\n**Any Advice?** ",

      "title": "My mother (58F) and I (23F) resent each other. What else can I do besides moving out?",
      "content": "Context: I strugged with clinical depression and anxiety since high school which I now feel mostly recovered from thanks to treatment I received through my university's mental health services. I was fortunate enough to receive enough scholarships that my family didn't have to pay for tuition, but I did end up graduating a year later this summer (at no expense). I've been living with my parents rent-free since I turned 18, but even though I worked part-time during the second half of undergrad as well as the extra year I took to graduate, I still don't have enough saved up to move out yet. Unfortunately, I decided to quit recently and am currently studying full-time for a grad school extrance exam.\n\nI'll cut to the chase and admit that I'm not contributing to the house that a person of my age should be. Growing up, my SAHM insisted on cooking and cleaning up after me since she emphasized that my education was my only job/concern. Combined with my mental health problems at the time, I'm at a point where even though I'm now expected to do it all on my own, I struggle to clean as frequently or consistently as I should. \n\nAs a result, my mother goes into my room while I'm away and continues to do so for me, but this upsets me because despite her intentions, I know I'll never learn to be independent if this goes on. My hygiene habits also took a nosedive alongside my mental health and have only improved somewhat, but any attempt to provide a mental health-based explanation gets dismissed as an excuse for laziness. I try to cook my own meals because my diet differs from my family's and have occasionally made meals I could eat with my parents. However, that also poses an inconvenience for my mother since she likes having the kitchen to herself.\n\nAll of the above has now resulted in a passive-aggressive war between my mother and I. All I ask is that she stop making destructive comments about my shortcomings like, \"How do you expect to become a (desired occupation) if you can't even do ___?\" or \"Even dogs know how to clean up after themselves\" and \"Are you sure you did ___? Because it doesn't smell/look like it.\" However, any attempt to set that boundary results in an explosive argument with the only takeaway being that I should move out if they bother me so much. I'm tempted to just cave in and start paying monthly rent even though it would eat up all my savings in a matter of months.\n\nPlease be kind, but honest. It isn't pleasant realizing that I've essentially been a burden on my parents despite being told otherwise until recently.",

We have our first vacation planned in August, he was kind enough to pay for the hotel and flights. I’m paying for food, activities, etc when we’re there. \n\nOn Saturday a netflix show we were watching (forever) dealt with a girl who had a sex video released. Later on he asked if I’ve ever made a sex video and I said no. Then he said ‘someone sent me a sex video of you’, obviously I was freaking out. My mind went to thinking someone took one of me without my consent. He kept this going for like 5mins but I was so stressed. He was like telling me he’s going to pull it out now and show me which kept adding to my anxiety. He told me to look in his eyes and tell me I don’t have one, which I did!! He just kept continuing it and I know it was only like 5mins but I was distressed (even though I didn’t show it). In the end he pulled out a video of me he finds sexy as a ‘joke’. I told him after that wasn’t cool and I thought someone took a video of me without my consent.\n\nI know boys in high school who have taken videos without the girls consent (which I told him), disgustingly enough my own brother admitted to trying to take a video without consent but the girl found out and cracked his phone screen (didn’t tell him this part). My boyfriend made me feel so crazy and stressed, even if it wasn’t his intention.\n\nThis happened on the weekend and I’ve been so turned off by him ever since then. We haven’t had sex since then. I’m seeing him tonight and he has no clue I’m still upset about this. \n\nI’m trying not to be petty, but seriously what if I told him someone sent me a video of him cheating? I’m pretty sure he’d be upset. \n\nOur relationship is mostly good besides this one thing that happened. I’m just so not into him right now, I know that’s how relationships go through stages like this but idk. What the hell do I do?\n\nEdit: Also not sure if it’s relevant but on april fools day I pranked him and told him I’m pregnant. It lasted like 2 minutes through because I couldn’t lie about it too long. We don’t really ‘prank’ each other like this so I genuinely believed him.",

He makes me have a very calming presence. \n\nWe started talking again 2 months ago (this makes sense in the extra context area) and same thing. I saw him twice in May and will in 2 weeks again. He is the one who keeps asking for me to come, has had me meet his friends, goes above and beyond for me, opens the car door, tries to buy me random things, won’t let me pay for anything, our sexual connection is beyond incomparable, he talks to me constantly and calls at night. Most nights we talk for hours.\n\nI agree with going slow, but sometimes I get mixed signals on “slow” when the way he is towards me is as though he really really likes me (he did tell me he likes me a lot, he says often he misses me and laying with me, etc.) but then certain wording can get him suddenly scared. \n\nWe did decide to take things slow. He did tell me he gets nervous about taking it too fast.  It what confuses me is that one time I called him dear and it was because he said it several times and was like idk if we should be saying that?

He hasn’t dated anyone since then, focused on himself and got his bachelors and masters. I got over all of my. Trauma from my ex husband who he knew through the marines and disowned him. \n\nAnyways never expected even 10 years ago for us to suddenly become more than friends in days.",

      "content": "Hi everyone. I’m hoping to get some outside perspective on something I’ve been struggling with in my relationship.\n\nI’ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and a half. I’m really passionate about politics and social issues - it’s more than just an interest, it’s how I spend my free time and something I care deeply about. I like learning, discussing, and engaging with these topics because they stimulate me mentally and emotionally.\n\nMy boyfriend, on the other hand, doesn’t care about politics or social issues at all, unless it directly affects him - and even then, he tends to go with whatever suits him personally, not what might be best for others or society as a whole.\n\nNow, I don’t think people need to have identical interests to be compatible. His hobbies are things like speakers, vinyl players, and electronics, and I’ve always tried to show interest even though those things don’t really excite me. I ask questions, listen when he explains things, and try to be present because I know it means something to him.\n\nBut I’ve noticed he doesn’t return the effort. When I talk about things that matter to me, he usually tunes out or gives joke answers. I’m not even asking for debates or deep analysis - I’d be happy if he just listened and let me share my thoughts, and maybe asked a question or two if something sparked his curiosity. But it feels like he can’t be bothered.\n\nHe also knows I don’t have many friends who are into this stuff, and that I struggle with social anxiety and sometimes other stuff - making it really hard for me to find new people to connect with. Yet his response is usually, “you should just make new friends.” That stings, because what I’m really looking for is connection with him, not outsourcing everything to someone else.\n\nI guess I’m just asking - how do people make it work when their partner doesn’t share their passions or values? Is it sustainable when one person consistently shows interest in the other’s world but doesn’t get that effort in return? \n\nThanks in advance for any thoughts or advice.",

I love him dearly and wholly. \n\nHowever, I always felt he didn't feel exactly the same for me. I ignored it, because we have a wonderful relationship, full of joy, trust, love and companionship. We like the same things, we feel at ease with each other and we support each other. We laugh a lot, joke and play with each other. We work well together, like a team. We rarely fight, we just talk about things and find a solution. I feel like I can be truly myself with him, like never before. \n\nLast year, he told me he was in love with me, after talking about our relationship and where we stood. \n\nThis past week, I asked if he was in love with me, but he said he didn't know... I said I was, and his reply was \"I know\". He also said I was the most important person in his life and that he was very lucky to have me and to have found me. Still, that hurt me deeply, more than words can express. I felt like something inside me broke. \n\nThis week I decided to talk with him. He didn't explain what or if anything changed. He said he doesn't know if he's able to fall in love, after some things that happened in his past. He said he feels love for me, but he does not feel \"in love\", like before when he was an adolescent/young adult. That there was a \"spark\" missing, that according to him, was never there from the beginning. He feels love, but he is not sure and there was always a doubt in him, despite the fact he described this as his best relationship ever, and that he feels attracted to me and desires me. He said he feels happiness, safety and care with me. He feels love, but not in love. \n\nI believe love does not have to come from a rush of passion, I think it can be built over time and it endures. It was like that for me and I do feel passionate about him. It was not love at first sight for either of us. We started as colleagues, that started dating after a random event brought us together. \n\nIt's important to say, this is the longest relationship for the both of us. We don't live together. I have zero reason to distrust him, and his behavious towards me remains the same. \n\nIs this relationship salvageable? Should we work on it? I desperately want to make it work. He said he wanted that too, and that we could not imagine losing me. \n\nI love him so, so, so much. \n\n(sorry about any mistakes, english is not my first language)",

      "title": "34F dating 35M How much doubt is too much in a long term healthy relationship?",
      "content": "Hey Reddit, hoping I can get some advice on this.\n\nI (34F) have been with my partner (35M) for almost 4 years now. We are not married but live in a house that we both own together. We've been living together for a little under a year and lately I have been feeling some doubts about the relationship. I can't quite tell if they're run-of-the-mill intrusive thoughts (I experience occasional OCD) that come and go with long term relationships, or if I should grant them credence. This is my first healthy relationship of this length.\n\nI love my boyfriend, we have a nice life together, but sometimes I get these intrusive thoughts that the relationship is \"not enough\". He pays 1/3 of the mortgage, a housemate pays another 1/3, and i am the main breadwinner and carry the last third, all taxes, insurance, and handle all house administrative work (landscapers, cleaners, maintenance, etc.). He works in the arts and I in software, so that financial split just makes sense, the admin split less justifiable, but I handle b/c my admin skills are better. We cook meals loosely 50/50. He is kind and thoughtful *most* of the time, though still needs reminding and some nudges, especially for weekly chores. He is not very handy and doesn't do as much extra work around the house as I'd like, so I sometimes find myself doing more than I want (e.g misc. construction projects). He's totally capable, but has that thing where he just, doesn't start it. It's something we're actively working on improving. He has a tendency to sloth and on occasion when we're intimate I get the ick or crave dating new people and new experiences (and that makes me sad).\n\nWe have a fairly aligned vision for the future. We support each other in our long term goals, but maybe not as much as I'd like. We're both artists, and we'll assist each other on projects here and there, but he mostly helps me when I pay him for the help b/c of the income disparity. We connect spiritually, and emotionally, and mostly physically but maybe not always? I'm certainly attracted to him, but he's not as handsome or as stimulating as my previous boyfriends, which can be distracting at times. We've been together for four years and it's a good life with a lot of love and trust but sometimes when I think about a \"proposal\" I wonder if i would say yes to *forever*.\n\nOther things to note are:\n\n1. I could do better with my friends and spend more time with them so I get more from those relationships than from my boyfriend\n2. He's an artist full time, and I am part time. We met working on my art project, in which he was employed by me and I feel our strongest connection is when working on art projects together (which, we haven't done in a while)\n3. The thoughts are not omnipresent, but do creep in randomly (1-2x a quarter?) and when we're on vacation sometimes.\n\nDo these reflect natural feelings to work through or that pass or is this something I need to be wary of? Both? It gets particularly strong when I smoke certain strains of pot lol.\n\nAnyone in successful long term relationships that can chime in with similar experiences? What does *enough* mean? Is it a farce?\n\n",

Before we left to meet up with them, he said I could play this new song from my favorite singer in the car on the way back. So when we left, I turned it on and he would just not stop shitting on it and I was really upset. I didn’t talk to him for 2-5 minutes in the car (to calm myself down) and then I said what he said was mean. He said “yeah…”and ig that was the end of that convo in the car. Then when we made it back to school, I again explained that I wasn’t talking that much in the car because he was really mean and he started saying that he’s been being mean to people all week and can’t figure out why and he was just in a bad mood in the car and likes to only play his music in his car and he needed to stay awake for the 45 minute drive and I wasn’t talking so that wasn’t helping him. He also said that he doesn’t even like himself at times and then the conversation turned from me being hurt to him being hurt and I started to comfort him. This just feels off. Irdk. \n\nDated for 9 months, broke up for 2, got back together in November 2024. \n\nHow do I go about talking to him about this? I do love him dearly but, this kinda feels unfair and draining.\n\n\nUpdate: I basically told/asked him all the stuff you guys were saying and thank you to everyone that commented, I read everything. I told him how I felt about the situation and he basically said that I don’t consider what he’s going through and I’m ungrateful so we broke up. He said because he doesn’t think he’s the one for me and doesn’t want to waste my time so I guess that’s that.",

      "content": "I, F20, and my Boyfriend, M21, have been dating for 7 months. \nI want to go ahead and say that I am not really materialistic. Everything that I ever wanted, I work for myself and I buy myself. I don’t expect other people to pay for my wants. \n\nWhen we first started dating, my boyfriend used to offer to pay for everything for us .\nWhether there be small Starbucks drinks or even just going out to eat, he would offer to pay. \n\nRecently, it seems like he really does not offer to pay for anything for me anymore . So much so that I feel like I pay for him more than he pays for me. I don’t expect him to pay for some super expensive meal if you go out to a restaurant, but it would be nice that one if he offers to pick me up food on his way home that he would pay for it. \n\nI do want to clarify that I don’t get anything really expensive I for a kids meal just because they are significantly cheaper at around five dollars and the portion control is better since I am trying to lose weight and it helps with dieting. \n\nHe asked me to send him money for literally anything. Whether it be a five dollar kids meal here and there or if we want to go somewhere I have to drive so I use my gas. We went on a day trip up north for three hours. He drove, but he wanted me to pay for the gas.\n\nI buy him small things all the time and I really do spoil him. Recently, I’ve brought him countless golf polos, I bought him a $50 limited edition water bottle that came out because it looks like a golf ball.\n\nThe money that I spend on him, it really doesn’t seem like he spend any money on me. I would like some effort when it comes to planning dates even. it seems like every time we sit on the couch and watch a movie of his friends ask him to get on the game. He would rather leave me and then goes and gets on the game. He would rather play golf, mind you it ranges anywhere from usually 62/100 dollars for a tee-time. WEEKLY. \n\nMy boyfriend is very sweet. He’s very affectionate very loving. Anytime I buy myself flowers put on my face. He says that he doesn’t like when I do it because it makes him feel bad because he doesn’t get me flowers but that doesn’t necessarily make sense to me because if it really does make you feel bad when you see my vase empty, why do you get flowers?\n\nI have more bills than he has to pay. His car is paid off while I have car payments. (i was hit by a D driver and didnt recieve anything from insurance) I have to register my car, and even my car insurance is more expensive. He is aware that I have more financial obligations than he does and I spend more of my money on him than myself. He also has a support system from family if anything goes wrong and he needs help, while I do not\n\nIt’s not about the materialistic things, but it’s more about the effort being put in. \nHe says he wants to save money but then is going on a trip with his friends to Vegas next week because it’s his friends birthday and he said that that he plans on gambling and drinking and going to bars. \nI will be going with them because I am not when I do those things I will be waiting alone at the hotel room.\n\nDo I seem like a greedy person for wanting more\n\n",

      "content": "My boyfriend \"John\" and I met at our job at a restaurant and have been together for a year. The nights weren't terribly late, but the rest of my friend group works your typical 9-5 so we didn't get to see them as often as we'd like. Over this past year, John has become very close with the rest of my crew, which I'm incredibly happy about. We're really like a family (in fact, one of them is my sister (28)), and do everything together.\n\nPart of this friend group is my sister's partner, my brother in law \"Nick\" (39). Nick works a high paying commission based job and has done really well for himself. John has been wanting to get out of food service for a while, and as he's learned more about what Nick does, he decided that was also his path. Nick has been such a blessing to John, as he really took John under his wing to show him the ropes and get him ready. John finally put in his two weeks at the restaurant, finished it out, and is now training under Nick. They have been going to meetings and other outings related to the field, and John also now gets invited over to dinner, even when I can't make it.\n\nI want to make it clear that I am absolutely THRILLED for John. He's an incredibly hard worker and deserves this big break. He seems happier and is really hitting the ground running. But I cannot get these feelings of jealousy to go away. \n\nI am still at the restaurant. I don't have a degree, and I have always struggled with that fact because I've felt stuck doing these back-breaking, low paying jobs my whole life. I already didn't get a lot of time with my friend group because of my work schedule, and now that John is out of the industry, he gets to be with them more than me. I know this is not true and not on purpose, but I feel so left out.\n\nI've also struggled with feelings of inadequacy in my friend group since the beginning. My sister is a great cook and incredibly handy, she could build an entire house by herself. Nick is whip smart, funny, and practically our group's \"leader.\" The other two friends (31F, 41M) are also great cooks and great caretakers, making sure details are taken care of and everything is accounted for. And now John is also whip smart, funny, a great cook, does cool things like ride motorcycles, etc. I feel like I offer my friends nothing. I don't have any particular skill to provide, I'm smart but not as knowledgeable as the rest of them, and I just work a crappy front of house restaurant job. I am so afraid of being replaced by John, even though I logically know that's not true. But I also feel like the only reason that's not true is because he is my partner, so if they want to hang out with him, I'll be there sometimes. None of these people have ever made me feel this way, but in the wake of it seeming like everyone has or is getting their lives together, I feel like a useless lump. And I don't want these feelings to drive any of them away.\n\nHow do I navigate these feelings with my boyfriend and friends? I cherish them more than anyone else in my life, but I want to give them real reasons to want me around. ",

First few days of our group holiday, he was kissing my neck, stroking my arm, holding my hand, grabbing my waist. He mentioned that dating a best friend could make life easier, I just laughed it off.\n\nThen we ended up sharing a bed and it kind of just happened. Years of pent-up energy. It was that tear-your-clothes-off kind of thing. I was hesitant, I told him it would change things, that I couldn’t be casual about it. He said he’d always been sexually attracted to me but that we’d argue too much if we dated. That was kind of it. I’ve always joked we’d argue too much if we dated so he used my line on me.\n\nThe next few days were weird. I hoped we’d laugh about it but he totally shut down. Barely spoke unless he was drunk. I was so confused, it didn’t feel casual at all. I felt overwhelmed, definitely like something had shifted in me. Our friends said they think he likes me but wouldn’t admit it. Apparently, he said he was scared I felt more, which felt like deflection but idk.\n\nOn the last day, I pulled him aside. He said he kept trying to talk but would chicken out. Even when we spoke, it was surface-level and awkward. I just said I don’t get neither of us could talk about it or laugh etc. we both felt very anxious. I stupidly said I was scared he felt more, just so I wouldn’t have to hear it if he did. He said he was an asshole for not checking in and blamed anxiety, said he struggles expressing emotions. Which gave me anxiety because he still didn’t really say anything. He just didn’t want to ruin our friendship and didn’t want things to be weird etc. which I was agreeing with. The tension was so high. I’m also terrified of him being weirded out or grossed out by me???\n\nA week later I texted him. He said it meant the world to hear from me, and that he cherishes our friendship, he just wanted to give me time. I’m heading back home soon and thinking maybe we should meet. But I don’t know if I should bite the bullet and tell him I feel different, or if that’ll just make things even weirder",

I have asked him to make it official with me but his reasoning is that he feels that he does not “deserve” me.

In this state he does not speak to me, barely acknowledges me, and does not face me. I have tried to be patient and help him out but he just doesn’t relent. This has been an issue that has become worse. \n  Now I’m just frustrated. I try to give him advice, which he says is good, but he doesn’t listen to it. He can acknowledge his faults but does nothing to move forward from them. This is all very taxing on my own emotional/mental health as I have my own problems. As well as making me shutter myself because if I express any negative emotion (even if it’s unrelated to him) he’ll shut down. Last night he and I talked and I told him about an inpatient program near us. He was open to it but did not have the financial means to attend. \n  Later in the night he called me and said how he missed when he didn’t have to tell me or express his feelings. That hurt me because I feel like doing those things can deepen a relationship. I told him I was getting more detached and will no longer give him any more chances. He said he’d listen to my advice and let me help him. But the part that somewhat annoys me is he joked that he had “the best therapist.” I asked who and he replied saying I was. I don’t want to be his therapist, though. I don’t mind helping him with immediate troubles and things of the sort but I feel like I can’t be put in that position. I want a relationship, not a client. I don’t know how to tell him I don’t want him to view me as such and not to treat me like that. I am just starting to get very disillusioned and frustrated with our relationship and am unsure. \n\nTLDR: My boyfriend called me his therapist and I don’t want to be his therapist. I just want a relationship and not to have him rely on me in such a way. ",

Early on she expressed her career goals and I was supportive of that. She informed me that her job could get a little crazy and asked if that would be okay, I felt confident it would be just fine. She pretty immediately lived with me, something we were both happy to do. Her work was no issue at first, then her hours changed and so did the workflow. \n\nNow instead of getting off at 5pm she’d stay late pretty consistently, an environment that didn’t rest. As much as I wanted to understand, I didn’t. It started to bother me, it felt like we didn’t get much time together and a lot of me felt “paused” while I waited for her to come home. It came with little to no communication on her end about how late she’d be as well, always saying it’s hard to say and she never knew when it was going to happen. This became a regular argument for us, I was feeling unimportant, and like she didn’t wanna be with me at home. During some of these arguments she’d leave the house which would throw me into a panic of “are you coming back?!”. I’m not proud of these things, I was in therapy at the time and although she told me I had abandonment issues they’d never presented so strongly before. \n\nI worked with my therapist a lot on this, I wanted to be okay with her work and coming late and I couldn’t understand why it was proving so hard. But I tried, I really tried. In between of course we had other arguments, I didn’t like her alcohol consumption, wasn’t wild but always concerned me. She started to feel unsupported with her career which was very important to her. A lot of in between things. Still things felt so loving a lot of times. 2 years pass and I got a new therapist. Now I was basically bringing all my same issues to this new therapist. Things like, reactivity, I was quick to escalate my voice or not pause before speaking and I knew it needed to change. My abandonment issues and anxiety were skyrocketing all the time. I used to “freeze” which in high emotion moments sometimes I’d feel frozen in the situation, like I genuinely couldn’t move or get words out. \n\nI had to learn to be a better listener and really hear and comprehend the things I was being told. I knew all of it, and I had always wanted to change it without success. This new therapist was amazing, we connected well and within a year, I made amazing progress all across. Genuinely, all across. But by then, my gf was already so distant, celebrations didn’t feel joyous, sex slowed down a ton, intimacy was lacking, conversations weren’t the way they used to be. she was tired. I understood that. \n\nHealed, I could look back and see my part in all of it. This is not to say she was perfect throughout, but I know I did damage to the person I loved and love so dearly. Now, a week ago, she broke up with me. Saying things like “I can’t commit. But nothing is going to change between us.” That was confusing and didn’t make much sense. She said she had to be selfish and focus on her. Big things coming up in her job and she was stressed about it, she started therapy just a month ago. Lots going on. But the next day we woke up, kissed said I love you and went on. It felt cold and distant some days, other days we’d be together laughing and having a great fun time together, acting as a couple. There was an even a day that felt so great and amazing that come night time she made a sexual advance on me. But there was also a day she got so drunk, blackout drunk, and was trying to fix my family relationships so that I wouldn’t be alone when she leaves me. There was a lot of crying from her, her telling me she didn’t wanna be with me, doesn’t wanna be with me anymore, telling me to just go away. I didn’t. It was 2am, I saw she was struggling, I just calmly said “I know, but I’m not going anywhere”. She then pulled me into a kiss. All of this behavior and back and forth has been confusing for me. For her too I’m sure. I want to work on things. The outburst of getting blackout drunk was unlike her, I did tell her she has to cut alcohol out though. \n\nNow, things feel fine. Sometimes she leans into me a bit more, she’s still kissing me she still has small cuddles with me. But also at moments feels distant. I dont understand, I’m not sure how to navigate this. I know she cares and loves me. My own therapist thinks her starting therapy amplified things, that subconsciously her brain knows she has to face her traumas from being a kid even though she hasn’t spoken on it yet in her therapy. I’m not sure what to believe. I just want her to feel safe with me and trust me and understand I’m not going to revert to how I was. ",

      "content": "I just graduated college this May and came back to my hometown. I ended up hanging out with some high school friends, people I don’t even see often, maybe once every six months. (Not gonna lie, I didn’t really like most of them.)\n\nAnyway, we went out around 11 p.m. to grab food at a restaurant, and our waitress turned out to be someone who also went to our high school. She used to be a really close friend, one of the first people I ever truly opened up to. The last time I remember seeing her was back in 2018 when we got coffee and had a really deep conversation. After that, we just drifted apart.\n\nI was caught off guard seeing her again, especially since I was kind of high and later had a couple beers. I got shy, but I cracked a couple jokes and she laughed. I didn’t say much else and ended up just going home.\n\nTwo days later, I messaged her and asked if she wanted to catch up. She responded really warmly, something like “OMG yes! I loved seeing you! We should definitely catch up.” She told me she was about to travel out of the country for a few weeks, but she said she’d love to meet up when she gets back. I told her to reach out when she’s back so we can plan something.\n\nSo now I’m wondering:\n\n1.\t⁠How would you personally interpret a reconnection like this after years apart, friendly or romantic?\n2.\t⁠Would you keep the DM conversation going while she’s away, or give it space and wait until she’s back?\n3.\t⁠If you were in my position, how would you handle things",

      "title": "I (30m) am currently in a band with my now ex girlfriend (26f) and it’s tearing me apart. How do I continue forward?",
      "content": "Going to start from when I first met her. Let’s refer to her as “A”. I had just gotten back from the biggest gig of my career in New York and needed something to keep me busy. I joined a local cover band and shortly after, the leader of that band invited A to play some songs with us. I was instantly smitten. I got the courage to ask her to join a new project with my original music. \n\nInitially it was nothing romantic because when I returned from New York, I was already in a relationship.  I made that clear to A at the beginning. However both my previous relationship and the original music band eventually fizzled out and I moved pretty quickly from my previous relationship to A. \n\nA and I became best friends doing everything together.  Writing songs, going to open mics and performing together in that local cover band. We started to feel ambitious and we branched out from that cover band to something a little more professional. We built our own band from the ground up and it’s at the point where we play almost every week. We were successful. For reference the band members are my close friends from college. \n\nWe had been dating for about a year until about 3 months ago before my birthday she called me and said we work better as bandmates and we should break up etc. At that time, I was in agreement because we started to get into petty arguments, became reserved about the future and music was taking a back seat. At that moment, it felt like we weren’t on a happy path. \n\nAfter the phone call nothing really changed. We would still text all day and hang out afterwork. We would spend weekends together going out hanging with each other’s friend groups etc. So without really realizing, I was still falling deeper in love with someone who had already broke away mentally but not physically. I caught her texting a guy from our music scene but didn’t think too much of it.  She was still my girlfriend and bandmate at that point and people around me would agree, but to A we were only band mates those 3 months.\n\n2 weekends ago she decided we needed to set boundaries. Basically no more sleeping together and not hanging out as much. That’s when it really hit me. She’s done with me. I spent the next 2 days trying to convince her things can change and how I’m willing to do anything for her. I was smoking a lot of weed during our relationship and I knew A never really liked it. I went as far as quitting smoking entirely (it’s now been a week) to show her how serious I was. I was dead set on making changes to be better all together. \n\nThat same weekend she set boundaries, we ended up getting duo opportunities and so we practiced and performed Fri/Sat just the two of us. She slept over at my house both nights afterwards. I thought I was winning her back but she kept being stern and was very set on us not being together. Ive been heartbroken and debated quitting the band but I know that’s not a good idea for me or my friends. I suggested she work on getting a new duo partner since that’s more intimate and I need space from that. I suggested working with the guy she was texting. She broke down and freaked out at my suggestion which was weird because he’s legitimately a great player and would work. She just kept insisting how I’m the only one she wants to work with and have in the band etc. I’m lost on how to go forward emotionally",

The first day was really great and she spared much time for me to speak with her and text her but today she treats me badly and distant. When I called her she hung up on my face which we promised not to do. There is a time difference for 7 hours and we do not contact often. She said that she wanted to continue this relationship and she will do her best but now i got confused. Do you think this can be sustainable through the whole summer and what should we be doing as a couple? Thank you",

      "title": "How do I navigate serious fears in a previously perceived to be good relationship? 26F/32M",
      "content": "I (26F) have been with my boyfriend “Mark” (32M) for 2.5 years. We live together, have a dog, and for almost all of the relationship I’ve felt loved, safe, and supported. He’s kind, gentle, very intelligent, I think would be an amazing father, and we're very compatible on a day-to-day basis. I used to be completely sure I wanted to marry him, but over the last few months I’ve started having serious doubts and am now just feeling so overwhelmed and unsure.\n\nThe biggest issue is that I’ve realized almost all the fun in my life comes from things I do *without* him. He’s very introverted, doesn’t enjoy group settings, and has no social life outside of me (literally has not gone to hang out with friends of his own one time since we've been together), and is obsessed with his work. When he does come to social things with me, I almost every time feel like I can’t fully enjoy myself because I know he’s not into it. I don’t want a life where I’m constantly making excuses for why my partner doesn’t come to things. I want someone who brings energy, personality, and presence into shared experiences, not someone who just tags along to appease me or sits them out.\n\nI basically got hit with this realization truck when I went on a trip with a big friend group in February and spent a lot of time with “Kyle,” a guy I’ve known for a few years from these trips. Long story short, he's basically my best friend and he told me he’s had feelings for me basically since we met and thinks I’m not as happy in my everyday life as I think I am. Unfortunately he was completely right and it basically upended my life. Since then, Kyle and I have had ongoing communication and emotional ups and downs (he loves me, he doesn't, he loves me...a lot of emotional whiplash). I'm physically attracted to him (more so than I am to Mark) and do love him - I don't think romantically, but absolutely platonically. I would never cheat on Mark, but can't help but have these feelings towards Kyle. I don’t want to be with Kyle long-term and I know he’s not “the one”, but he made me realize that maybe Mark isn’t either.\n\nThere are also deeper issues with sexual disconnect (Mark's \"favorite thing in the world\" I'm not at all into and is painful and I just hate it), and lifestyle compatibility - he’s overweight and is only now starting to take weightloss seriously, but it's been years of him telling me he would and not. Our sex life is basically non-existent since I'm just not attracted to him and feel like he monopolized sex before. He says now that he wants to move to the mountains and raise a family with me, but I don’t know if that desire is real or reactive. My parents (who I’m close with) have been gently critical of our relationship from the beginning, and I’m starting to see some of what they were concerned about.\n\nI’m scared that I’ll look back and regret walking away from someone who’s good to me and truly loves me. But I’m also scared I’ll stay out of guilt or fear - also want to have kids while my grandparents are alive, so the clock is ticking - and end up with a life that feels like one I settled for and where I'm lonely and bored.\n\nI've been trying to build more happiness and fun into my life, but for almost four months I've been feeling unsure and like the grass might be greener. Mark and I have talked a ton and he acknowledged he prioritizes work over my happiness and \"needs to do better\". Is there a perspective I'm missing, is this just normal-post-honeymoon-phase feelings, or could this just not be the right relationship for me?\n\nEdit: for grammar and to emphasize I wouldn't break up with Mark to be with Kyle, just that Kyle was the one who made me realize there might be someone else out there for me.",

      "content": "We both work from home and at the same company. 7 months ago our company had a big blow up and work's been very slow. Since then, he stays up all night. He was staying up till 2-3am before but now it's more like 5-6am. He hardly helps me around the house anymore and I feel so out of touch with him. He will make dinner almost every night. His other task is trash which he does most of the time but waits till it's so full I'm putting things on the counter and he'll never take out bathroom trash? Most days he's not waking till about 1-2pm then stays in bed till 2-4pm on his phone. When he gets out of bed, he's on the computer playing games most the rest of the day. This doesn't really bother me most days but really sucks on weekends because I'm just set alone when I want to be doing fun things with my partner.\n\nHe is the most carefree person I know, I love that about him! I know I can be uptight sometimes and he's always been that balance. But lately I've felt the need to get my life together. Progress and move forward. I really want a dog but we need to fix our fence because it's falling down. He says he's trying to get it fixed but no progress. Our toilet in our guest bathroom has been broken for 3 months. He says he's going to fix it but has had the part to fix for over a month. Our trash bin floated away in a storm and has been gone for a month, he called it in but says he's going to call again and doesn't. Our garage is a mess and I've been asking if we could work together for months to get it cleaned before summer hits to no avail. I've been using a plastic moving crate as my side table to the bed since we moved in, we've talked about getting bedroom furniture but he's never awake to make it to most stores on time because we live far.\n\nSeveral nights ago, I felt fed up and overwhelmed. I blew up on him and I know it wasn't the right way to approach the situation. It's difficult for me to bring my concerns to him because he gets really defensive when we fight. He says \"Well you should just ask me\" and I do ask but when I do he's usually not in the mood. So I give space and expect he'll come to me when he's ready to tackle that task but he never does.\n\nAfter the fight, he asked what he can do and I said maybe just help me around the house a little more. He seems pretty pissed about that answer, that I'd kept him up all night over some dishes but I was just trying to not overwhelm him.   \nI spent yesterday cleaning some of the garage and called the waste disposal to pick up our trash. \n\nHe seems distant since the fight, I'm trying to leave space. But I'm lost and don't know how to navigate this situation anymore.",

Since I have been home my spouse seems to be completely withdrawn from everyone they come home from work and basically disappear for two to three hours. I have talked to them about it multiple times in a calm even matter, but nothing changes. There have been multiple instances of them talking to me about doing something and changing something because I didn't like it. I normally respond to the discussions with it has been your ship for the last 3 and a half years I understand why that is the way it is and you don't have to change it on my account. These conversations usually lead to them saying but I know you don't like it and my response is that I appreciate you attempting to change something I don't like, but I am not going to harp about it anymore I have accepted this is the way you want it I am going to leave it alone. This repeats for 20 to 30 minutes, but the wording is almost the exact same. I don't feel like I am heard, and over the last 7 months I have taken up almost all of the responsibilities around the house and very rarely ask them for help. It is the least I can do after them have supported me over the last 15 years. It is my turn to support them, but all I want is to feel heard and when I ask for help to be acknowledged not ignored. They don't feel like they are heard either so we end up on this hamster wheel of going in circles both of us getting more frustrated I know that on both sides of the coin we both need to work together but when every suggestion is just shot down or not followed through with it is discouraging. I love this person with all my heart and am more than willing to fight for us I just don't know what to do. Please any advice is good advice. We are not splitting up over this just as a clarification.",

He’s the first guy in my life that didn’t play with my feelings. From the start I felt very comfortable with him. He was quick to show me off to his family and all of his friends. At first it all felt like a breath of fresh air. \n\nBut lately i’ve been bitter about a couple things. He doesn’t put as much effort as I do. I consider myself a very romantic and thoughtful person. For christmas I made him a basket of a bunch of little things I know he likes. I even made a second one for his mom too. Guess what he got me for christmas? Nothing. \n\nHe hardly ever takes me on actual dates anymore. When we go to each other’s houses all he does is nap. He doesn’t wanna go out and do anything. I PLAN THE DATES. I just want him to plan something and I don’t even expect anything expensive or flashy. \n\nWhen it comes to my standards, the bar is literally in HELL. All of my previous boyfriends NEVER even bought me flowers. He’s gotten me flowers maybe twice the whole relationship. \n\nHe doesn’t put any effort into looking nice for me. I’m a somewhat high maintenance girl, i’m always doing my makeup or something different with my hair. Yet, every time he opens his door he looks so disheveled and uninterested in me. \n\nAt the water park the other day, I was wearing a new bikini and i felt really confident in it. It was nice because I recently gained some weight and none of my clothes look good anymore. I was disappointed he didn’t compliment me or anything. \n\nI was trying to explain to him that to keep the spark alive, I want him to flirt with me like he’s still trying to pursue me. He just doesn’t understand, because he said: “But I already have you.” \n\nI wanted to say “Are you sure you’re trying to keep it that way?” But i know better than to  start something like that in public. \n\nSome other things, he doesn’t know how to cook, or how to drive. I feel like I have to do everything and he’s just getting princess treatment. \n\nHe also recently started to have some mental health struggles, I just don’t know what to say without hurting his feelings. \n\n",

A little bit of back story of our relationship is we have been through a lot that we have grown so much now, but it’s more of the little things that are starting to make me feel even more exhausted from. There was some cheating in the early 3 months of our relationship, trust issues, and even living separately at one point. We have grown through this not only for us, but for our little ones too. I want advice how to approach this situation of being so frustrated all the time with my partner. I want to rely on him for things, but there is just so much evidence that proves that I can’t. Now, I am not saying he doesn’t do anything because that would be a lie. He is an amazing dad and never fails to always be there for our son. He’s very good at mowing, watering plants, and feeding our cats. The things I am so desperately in need of help with are our dogs, he never takes them on walks and just seems to be a bit on the meaner side with them as just saying “go” or “stop” to them rather than teaching them how to do the commands. Next, he doesn’t really get up to his alarms and it seems like what I ask him to do in the morning is asking too much. I ask him to change the baby’s diaper, get the baby dressed, feed the dogs & cats, let the dogs outside to go potty, and some days make the baby’s breakfast before he goes to work. Most days, I come home from my job and he’s still in bed with our toddler. The next thing, I feel like he makes my life harder in some aspects. For instance, keep in mind this might be very minor, he threw away blueberries part of my diet plan just because I left them on the dining table overnight. It’s just exhausting knowing I am just going to have to go get a whole case of blueberries because I left them on the table. Next, I went to the laundromat from 9pm-12am doing 4 baskets of clothes (was too tired to fold them) and I left them in the living room. I took the next day off to catch up on sleep because I work nights and also been exhausted from my pregnancy. Anyways, he placed another basket with dirty clothes that got mixed in with a clean basket of laundry. These dirty clothes had a mildew rag and clothes covered in dirt from landscaping in them so unfortunately I will have to wash that entire basket again. I don’t really like it when he does laundry because he has broke a washer from everything being unbalanced, caused flooding in our basement from the sink getting clogged, and ruined many of my clothing. Another thing I am exhausted, he throws EVERYTHING away. I can no longer find pieces to our child’s cups and bottles because I take each complete apart to give it a proper wash in the dishwasher, but then I can’t find any of the pieces to them anymore because usually he unloads the dishwasher. He also doesn’t pick up diapers he changes as well and usually leaves cups and bowls sitting around for a week until I clean it up. I think I am asking for advice because I am yelling more and always in a bad mood around him now and I don’t want it to be that way. I do love this man very much, I just wish a load was taken a bit off of me. ",

      "title": "I (24f) cut off all my girlfriends (24f) in the last 2 years… am I the problem?",
      "content": "Reddit, I need some clarity. Am I the problem here?\n\nOver the last two years, I’ve lost nearly all my close girlfriends. Some friendships naturally fizzled out, especially the long-distance ones, but most ended because I felt disrespected or mistreated.\n\nThis all happened after I graduated from university and got into a relationship with my boyfriend. And now I’m scared it looks like I just dropped all my friends the moment I got into a relationship. That’s not who I want to be, but I can’t lie, that’s how it looks.\n\nPlease help me figure out if I’m the problem, or if these decisions were justified. Here’s some context:\n\nFriend 1\nWe were close, but I cut her off after she slept with someone I was seeing. On top of that, she gaslighted me into thinking it wasn’t a big deal. After I blocked her, she sent a long apology and even converted back to Islam. A few months later, she slept with her best friend’s man and started dating him. I’m convinced she’s a sociopath.\n\nFriend 2\nThis one really hurt. I genuinely felt disrespected by her, over and over again.\n\n\t•\tWhen we lived together, she kept taking my clothes without asking and never returned them unless I chased her.\n\n\t•\tShe took my shoes without telling me, then left them at a friend’s house for three months.\n\n\t•\tAfter I messaged her about it and we moved out, I found out through her Instagram story that she had taken my Versace jacket too, again without asking.\n\n\t•\tShe borrowed money multiple times, promised to pay me back, but never did.\n\n\t•\tI was chronically ill for three years, in and out of hospital clinics, and for the first 18 months, she never once asked how I was doing. No follow-up questions. Nothing. She still doesn’t know what I was diagnosed with, because I didn’t feel like she cared.\n\t•\tShe later became friends with someone who had repeatedly disrespected and used me, after telling me to cut that person off.\n\n\t•\tAnd every time I shared good news, she never seemed happy for me. There was always a weird, resentful energy. Eventually, I had to remove her.\n\nFriend 3\nShe was very manipulative. I’d try to do nice things, like bring a bottle or get her a thoughtful gift, and somehow it always ended in gaslighting or guilt-tripping. It’s a long story, but the emotional manipulation was constant. I eventually blocked her.\n\nFriends 4 (The Twins)\nThese two never disrespected me directly, and I still love them, but we drifted apart. Over time, they became increasingly insecure, talking about bleaching their skin and getting surgery. I didn’t judge, but it became uncomfortable when they started romanticising lighter-skinned celebrities and saying things like, “When I finally achieve this skin colour, I’ll win in life.”\n\nAs a dark-skinned woman, it was really upsetting. I brought it up gently, but they got defensive and angry. It broke my heart, honestly. I tried messaging them, I don't think they want to be friends with me\n\nFriend 5\n\nThis friend felt like my soulmate at uni. We were so close, but constantly arguing. I don’t think either of us was to blame. We just butted heads a lot, probably due to our different backgrounds.\n\nThat said, by the end, I felt she didn’t respect me. She spoke to me differently than she did others, dismissive, sometimes even condescending. She’d only call when she needed advice, then disappear for six months. She did this a few times.\n\nShe recently reached out again, but I ignored her. I’m not letting anyone have that kind of power dynamic over me again.\n\nFriend 6\nThis one’s actually my fault. Years ago, I threw up on her foot during a night out and we got kicked out. I was mortified. I apologised, but then basically ghosted her because I was so embarrassed.\n\nShe was a long-distance friend, so I didn’t think much of the silence, until I realised she had removed me from socials.\n\nThis still haunts me. It was a stupid, shame-filled mistake, and I don’t know whether to try reaching out or just leave it in the past.\n\n⸻\n\nSo now I’m here, looking back and feeling kind of isolated. I know people say, “Cut off whoever you need to protect your peace,” but when it’s this many people in such a short span of time, I can’t help but wonder…\n\nAlso what is it in life? How can you be great friends the first 7 years and shit gets weird the last 2?? Did I not see this before? Why does it seem like they're behind me on a mental level? Why am I constantly disrespected? I need to command respect. I'm a genuine person who wants the best for everyone, so what the hell??!?!\nAnd how does this happen with all my friendships at the same time? Life is so confusing \nWould genuinely love to hear your thoughts.\n",

      "content": "Hi, this all started during the end of my first semester of college. I (19F) have never been in a relationship before mainly because romantic relationships have always intimidated me. So one day towards the end of the semester me and all of my other single friends downloaded hinge for fun. We weren't really expecting to find relationships on the app but just wanted to put oursleves out in the dating world to see how we felt and we were all to scared to do it alone. After a day or two we began getting likes on our profiles and one of mine was someone I recognized. He was a regular at a dancing club me and my friends frequent. I had never talked to him but  always thought he was cute and a good dancer. At that point in time I wasn't really engaging with anyone on hinge so I didn't like him back, but I did kinda regret it after.\n\nA few weeks later, two weeks before the end of the semester the same guy from hinge approaches me at the club and asked for my number ( I saw this as a green flag because most guys from my school usually just ask for snaps). He said he thought I was cute and later (a few weeks later) revealed he had had a crush on me for awhile. I thought he was really sweet and genuine. We ended up dancing and talking the rest of the night and after I got home he texted to ask me out on a date. Since then we have been talking everyday. We have many common interests and have great converstations. He has made it clear that he wants a relationship but and wants to start dating again when school starts (we are both at home in different states for the summer). During the summer we have been texting, calling, or gaming together everyday. I was initially hesitant but the more I talk to him the more I like him and want this to turn into a serious relationship.\n\nHowever, I dont know whether to tell him that I saw that he liked me on hinge. I'm afraid if I tell him then he will think I'm not interested or hurt his feeling but if I don't tell him I feel like I'm keeping something from him. The worst part is that if this turns into a serious relationship and he finds out further down the line, I'm afraid he will feel betrayed.\n\nSorry for the long post but I just don't know what to do and feel like I'm overthinking this.",

      "content": "My partner(20F) and I(20M) have been dating for a little over a year, and we started our relationship very intimately, a lot more intimately than I was used to. She told me she had a rough past involving emotionally neglectful partners, and that she was hyper-sexual, originally as a mechanism to get attention from past relationships. I made it clear that I prefer to give sexual favors in order to feel physically needed/desirable (I have some body-image issues after multiple surgeries) She told me she originally thought she had BPD, but realized that she had just never been treated well before me.\n\nWhen the school year started, we both got stressed out over college and our relationship went into “winter mode” and stopped being as flirty/passionate. Since then, even past the end of the school year, our sex life has just gone slowly downhill. My partner seems perfectly content to just cuddle or watch tv or sleep together, but I feel more restless and frustrated the longer this goes on. I feel less like a boyfriend and more like a service animal. Like I’m being used for emotional validation, and that she doesn’t really find me attractive. I have a lot of intrusive thoughts about this.\n\nI try to make her feel good about herself and give her what she wants, in the hopes that she would eventually want something sexually from me, but nothing is initiated. I gave her cunnilingus a week and a half ago, and she said it felt amazing, but this only happened after I offered several times. We’ve talked about our differences a lot lately, and she always says things like “I love you so much and I need you in my life” or “you make everything better and I can’t afford to lose you” but then our relationship will just continue to go down that same path. \n\nWe have a lot of future plans, including moving in together, and potentially even marriage, but this is a huge roadblock for me. Lately the lethargy of our relationship has really been getting to me, to the point where I’ve been thinking about ending the relationship. I love her and I don’t want to be with anyone else, but I physically can’t stand to keep going in this direction. How do I fix this? I just want to feel wanted again.",

I have yet to see anything change. This is hard for me because I have so much love for him but I’m not sure our values for this relationship line up. \n\nEssentially I’m asking for some advice on how to show him that I am reaching the end of my rope and don’t know how much longer I can do this.",

But we kinda hit it off.\n\nWe match very good, personally, humor, other things ... if yk yk. i usually take a very long time to meet people in rl but as I knew him I was like kinda chill about it. So he asked me if i wanted to come along on a lil trip to ikea which I did. And it was fun and all.\n\nNow to my problem. On his profile he was rather fit. Not to much tho. Kinda dad bod vibes but in young (which I like.) but when he picked me up he was umm not that. I guess he must have gained a few pounds since the pictures were taken which is ok.i don't in any way want to fat shame him fr that's like not what I'm here for at all) but it's just not really my thing yk. and it's been on my mind ever since. Like it has been impacting the way I think of him and how I am when we text. \n\nI don’t know if I should bring it up. I know I shouldn’t be so superficial about his weight. But let’s be honest everyone has things they are attracted by or not. And it’s just not for me. \n\nThe thing is I like his personality a lot and I’d really want to date him. But I don’t think I can, with the weight being there. I totally get that life sometimes is hard and that the body often shows results of it. But honestly I feel a little catfished. \n\nHow would you act ? \nWould you bring it up? \nIf yes how? \nPlease I need help 😬\n(Also please be kind. Ik my situation isn’t the best I’m totally aware of that) ",

      "title": "I (31f) is struggling to have a normal intimate relationship with my bf (32m)",
      "content": "So I need some advice. My bf and I have been together for 4 years now. We have a good relationship minus the small typical tiffs in any relationship. What is lacking now is the intimacy part. In the beginning of our relationship, we would be pretty active, I would say 3 times out of a week. And I was satisfied with that. These past several months (like I would say 6 m) our sex life has gone down dramatically. To the point where we would go a month without any type of intimacy. And before anyone thinks this, no I don’t think my bf is cheating on me. I completely trust him wholeheartedly. Not once has he ever showed signs of infidelity or any type of sleezy actions. Like seriously this kid has no red flags. He trata me incredibly well and always cares about my well being. Since the beginning. Now this can be triggering to whoever is reading this so here’s a warning…….. earlier this year in January i unfortunately experienced a miscarriage. He saw how badly it affected me. Crying everyday, to refusing to eat… laying in bed and not wanting to go out. I’m sure it affected him to in his own way which we have discussed between each other. We weren’t looking to get pregnant at all but he knows how much I love babies and me wanting to be a mother when the right time comes. We’ve had conversations about me wanting to have intimacy like how it was before everything happened and he says he’ll try to be better but so far nothing has changed. If anything, we’d probably have sex maybe once a month. Or I engage it and try to get things going and there’s barely any response from him. To where I get frustrated and I get angry and completely shut down. Our sex life was so fun, healthy and vibrant and now it just feels so hollow. My love language has always been touch. I mean who die r want to be touched by their partner. I almost feel like I’m forcing it on him when I try to engage it and it just takes the fun spontaneity aspect of it out of the whole moment. I’m honestly almost getting to the end where I’m going to snap and give him an ultimatum. Which I think is ridiculous to think about doing. I really just want a normal fun sex life with my bf again. We’ve had 3 talks about getting back to that flow but I still haven’t seen much effort on his end. I don’t want what happened in January to have us be scared about having a sex life again ya know. Which I feel like that could the cause of it but our downfall started months before that happened. \nHe has told me that he doesn’t view intimacy as an important factor in a relationship but to me it is important. It shows trust and love to a healthy relationship. It almost feels like I have to ask for permission to have sex with my bf. No matter how many conversations we have about communication and our desires… I feel like when it comes to this subject, I feel like nothing is solved or wanting to be worked on. Like he used to jump my bones when I would bend down in front of him. Like me wearing a long T-shirt and panties on would get him rattled and now I try that tactic and theres is absolutely no response at all. \n\nIdk everyone, I feel like if this continues or gets worse… I’m just going to distance myself more and more from him to where it is really going to affect our relationship for the worse. I truly feel like that could be a possibility. \nI would love some advice if there’s any to give please Reddit. Can this relationship be salvageable?",

We definitely are opposites of each other even in personalities - i like to plan/live day2day and he plans ahead 5+years. \nWe have fertility problems, tried for 7+ years to conceive (ivf and egg donor) but never had a positive result. I decided to stop the treatment last year because I felt it too much on me already.\nPartner suffered an accident, is in recovery mode and because of free-ish time, partner mind went overdrive and apparently planned our future. His plans for the future regards:\n- Kids - it would be surrogacy and adoption (yes 2 processes. I was happy with only adoption. But in another convo, discovered that partner wants biological kids so it can have legacy aka leave the company to kids);\n- saving for 2 houses (one for partner mom and one for us);\n- and in order to save for all these, is for me to  work 2 jobs (at his company and continue to work for the current one). In the event of kids, partner expects me to be the one to take care of the kids while working, and he works to provide for all of us.\n\nAm i over-thinking this whole scenario feeling like this marriage is doomed because of these plans? Like maybe we definitely want different things and are not on the same page? #feeling overwhelmed ",

      "title": "My(30F) boyfriend(34M) is becoming more successful and I feel he’s going to use his money as leverage. How to navigate?",
      "content": "Hello Brutally Honest Reddit.. \n\nAs the title says, my boyfriend is becoming more successful & therefore financially, becoming very well off. \n\nMoney, I know is an important aspect that can give freedom & take certain stressful aspects from life.. like if we have children, not having to have the same stresses that people that don’t have a lot of money would have. But overall, I’m not somebody that “feels” anything from money. For example, a thoughtful gift would mean more to me, over an expensive gift. \nHe definitely shows his love in forms of gifts, buying me expensive gifts for my birthdays ect (Rolex expensive) and not expecting me to buy him something expensive back. (He told me he wanted something that was $1000 that counted as his Christa’s & birthday present) all while he got me a Rolex for my birthday.. and 1ct each  diamond ear rings & 2 gold rings for Christmas. \n\nAnyways.. as my boyfriend has been progressing, I’ve been building him up & making him believe in himself & have always tried to make him realize how great he is. \nThis has been working. Almost.. too well. \n\nI’ve noticed he definitely believes in himself more now and is proud of himself. But almost in a “I’m the prize” way. (Meaning he sees himself as the prize) \n\nFor example.. \nhe wanted to go to abroad this weekend, just for the weekend. I declined & said I couldn’t afford it right now. He then said he’s paying for it.\nI explained that I appreciate that, but I don’t want him to feel like I expect that from him.. I don’t want him to resent me for being a financial burden. I said he could go with one of his male friends & I wouldn’t be upset. \n(To be clear, I make good money myself, have my own apartment, great car.. ect.. but he’s making still x3 my salary) \n\nTo this he said it’s fine, and that he just wants to be free to be able to go on boys holidays without any issues (I’d never give issues) \n\nAnd I made a joke saying “haha, paying me off for silence” \n\nHe then said…\n“Well if you know where your breads buttered your more likly to pick your battles wisely” \nThat’s an exact quote. \n\nI want to make sure that this relationship doesn’t turn into one where he uses his financial status to “silence” me.. or begin to turn into somebody that makes me feel like I need to keep on his good side & be a good little girlfriend to keep this great successful guy. \n\nI mean.. he is a great successful guy.. but I don’t want to be made feel I can’t speak my mind or bring up things if I don’t feel comfortable with them. \n\nIs this one of those situations where I just have to keep my eyes open & hope he doesn’t turn into somebody that would make me feel like that? \n\nTL;DR my boyfriend is beginning to make a lot more money in a new job and I’m afraid it’s going to change him into a man who tried to use his status to control or silence me, in order to do whatever he likes. \n\n\n",

We go to the same college and share the same faith in God. After awhile she decided to end things. She told me her mind made her think the relationship was hard. That it would be better if she was single, so when I called her the night before my final exams, she told me directly to \"go away from me\". I asked her if she still liked me and while shaking her voice and angry she said \"no\". She's had outbursts like this before. But she has never said she didn't like me before. The day after my finals I went to her house, we talked for awhile about what she said and she said that she regretted it. But then I asked \"do you want to break up with me\" after a long hesitation she told me yes and we broke up. I had met a friend L(24F) a week before this. I never had feelings for her beforehand. But I went to her place to give her a gift for tutoring me for like 8 hours (50$ gift for tutoring I desperately needed seemed like more than a fair trade) we talked for hours, she told me she is avoidant attachment directly. We shared so many interests me and N never shared. I tried to take N to a gun range one time which she had agreed to but then when we got close to the range she \"got tired\" so we went home.Me and L shared a crap ton of interests. We both love cyber security, we both love Minecraft, we both love anime, we both are introverted, hell we were even apparently born in the same hospital and share a blood type. I started to feel like maybe we could be more than friends, we both made jokes and she even made eye contact with me, which is hard for her because funny enough she also has ASD.... I feel like we could be more than friends. We even shared a very nice hug I got her consent for. However, after me and L spent time together, she went away for the summer and went no contact. Then after three weeks she told me she doesn't want to be my friend anymore and that she's uncomfortable around me. Research since has told me this is due to her attachment style.\nMy time with N was nice, but then she hurt me badly, our love had faded. Now N wants to get back together, and I do as well... Kind of. I wasn't excited at the prospect but I felt it's what I sort of wanted. I feel like I love L a bit. But I don't know what to do. Who do y'all think I should choose to pursue? ",

I have no desire to get back with him. But if we both do the necessary growth in confronting our mistakes and trauma, could we still be friends after going no contact for the time being?

We stayed up all night talking to each other, FT every second we had available. I learned she’s only been in two short term relationships since, with the recent one being with someone who also lived in my state. The recent one she dated for a handful of months and thought he was “the one”. \nThrough the week we’re constantly talking and she has a lot of free time (she was finishing school), and then she finally makes the drive to come see me.\nWhen she gets here, we have a good time but she does mention that she thought about it and doesn’t want to hurt me and like, was being weird about whether or not we should date. I proceeded to give her the best head of her life, and the best dick lol(I have gay friends who heard from other women, so ik that’s the truth). \nShe had to leave early since she started working the beginning of the week, and has been extremely busy (unpaid and overworked intern) since then but we finally got to FT again.\nIn the conversation she brings up how “you have everything I want on paper: I known you for 6 years, I know you’re a good guy, I know you treat me right, I *know* the sex is good, you’re funny and I’m attracted to you… but I don’t have romantic feelings.” That’s not quite what she said but that was the point. And I just don’t understand. Anyway I wasn’t begging her after I just kept it lighthearted after sitting in it.\n\n***Here’s my question***: what does that mean that I have “everything on paper” but when it comes to dating, she doesn’t have that feeling for me. How can she be physically attracted to me, like the sex, and I make her feel safe but she doesn’t want a relationship? \ndo I pursue her? I really like her, and I really want this to work. If I do pursue, what does that look like?",

I was often negative about myself, and I would get sensitive to how he treated me which would upset him.  He was often dishonest and treated his friends better which really made me hurt.\n\nWe decided after that we wanted to remain friends, but it is getting difficult to manage.  He'll often bring up our past in a way that jabs at me, saying things like \"it's hard to look at you the same after you said those mean things about me.\"  I don't know how to react because the \"mean\" things I said were more labels he had earned.  I called him a serial liar because he faked the country he grew up in the entire relationship.  He has said other things like \"you are the one who causes all issues between us.\"  It's very hurtful words but he says them in a sweet/innocent tone, it's like he wants to put me down without me being able to react.\n\nThere are parts of him I really enjoy but it's clear we both have a lot of hurt from our past, what can we do to improve our chances at a healthy friendship together?",

      "content": "We started off the “relationship” decently well but at first glance I could tell she had some issues (tattoos everywhere, hate for men in general, no job or ambitions). It escalated and I gave her a shot, but about 3 months in she said she wanted a break to find herself. Naively, I said alright and let it slide and gave her space. Then, she told me that her ex (23F) had contacted her and said that she got jealous seeing us together, little did I know her ex was her best friend. Fast forward to a few months ago after going back and forth for many months, she finally told me she was seeing someone else which broke me. I completely cut her off after this but not long after she sent me a large text basically admitting that she was a bad person that uses people but she wants to change, I figured this was because she broke up with the other guy and needed attention. I essentially told her no messing around, I will help her while she gets help. We did this for a few weeks and I would always text her to check in on her because I really do care about her. I ended up cutting her off about 6 or 7 times over the course of this period and she would never respect my space, meanwhile I respected her space when she needed it. She recently sent me a love letter in the mail with flowers that essentially said I saved her life and that she hoped one day we could see eachother again and things would be different. I’m not currently moved on from the situation, and toxic women like this have been in my life before and it makes it super difficult to move on since they don’t give you space to get over them. I know what I should do, but I guess I’m just looking for some advice/experience in this sort of situation. I know that I only am attracted to her because she’s pretty, and nothing more than that but I can’t help but think this could be her actually trying to get some help. Please let me know what you guys think!",

She is absolutely the woman I want to marry someday. For some reason though I can’t get her on the phone at anytime that she doesn’t schedule it. I on the other hand always drop anything that I’m doing to answer the phone. I’ve been with my mom, been at work, and even in the bathroom I at least answer and tell her I can’t talk and say a couple things. I’d drop just about anything to answer her call. But on the other hand when I call her at anytime that she is doing anything even completely minor. I can’t get a response. She’s always doing something though. Whether it be talking to her sister or her mom and dad or just hanging out in the upstairs area she will not answer me. The only time she ever answers for the most part is in the basement where her room is. The sadder part is that she is chronically on her phone even when with me sometimes. She had 22 hours screen time on Instagram and TikTok last week. Even worse is that even when we’re hanging out she has to check her phone and even in the middle of the motions of intercourse she picked up a call from her sister. The only time I’ve ever had to do that was when my brother called me 8 times and that was to tell him to shut up. So I’m asking how I should go about approaching this? I don’t know if it’s normal or if I should ask her about it or just completely ignore it and hope i can get over it. I know she isn’t meaning to be rude in anyway though and I have no idea how to tell her without making her sad.\n\nTl;dr my girlfriend can’t pick up the phone even though she is always on it and can pick it up with me.",

      "content": "Hi everyone, my gf broke up with me 3 months ago, I can move on but I'm choosing not to maybe because I still have hope that she will come back (I might be wrong).  \nWe started dating in Jan 2024 first 4 months were great she was happy and I was giving everything in our relationship to make her feel safe and secure as she had a bad past as her ex cheated on her and he used to chat with multiple girls while being in a relationship because of which she had trust issues.  \nI used to stay up all night making sure she is safe when she used to feel anxious when everything was going well in this time period my dad was hospitalized and I still gave her enough time as she was anxious because of her exams and I had to take care of my dad our family business and almost every other thing. I started asking her to put some effort into the relationship as it was already six months being with her in a relationship but she chose to shut down at the moment didn't reply to me after that I chose to not text her to see whether she cares or not as I was the only one who used to text everyday whether its Good morning or how you are doing and to my surprise we went to 6 days of not talking at all in between those 6 days she only texted me once that too because she needed my help with some work. She used to say that I never text first as I want to feel like the guy wants to talk to me.  \nIn August one of my female friend broke up and she needed my suggestion whether she should be with her or not as we were like good friends in university before I took a break from my studies even after that she used to text me to see how me and gf were doing as a couple as my gf was also my classmate. That same day she asked me how me and gf were doing so I talked to her on call explaining whats happening etc etc and I also communicated this thing with my gf but she took it in wrong manner as I was cheating on her emotionally since that day Ive been trying to make up to her. I blocked that girl from everywhere and I haven't even talked to her till date. I took a break from my work to spend 15 days with her to make her feel comfortable but nothing was helping her she kept on questioning that I was cheating on her with other girls.   \nI had a rough patch in my life in Nov and Dec and my work demanded more time from me and I stopped doing any other activity in my life and she kept on saying that you're not giving me enough time Idk how because I was still talking to her like at least 4-5 hours a day.  \nThings kept on getting worse as no matter what I do she was still the same she used to block me all the time but she used to text me whenever she felt down to ask me if I can meet her. The last time she called me to meet her was in Jan before her exam as she was way too stressed about it and I never said no to her about anything but right after she got stress free in her life she completely cut me off from her life she used to life in my city because of her studies now she is back in her hometown idk if I should push it or not as the last time I had a chat with her she said she is not interested in me anymore she doesn't even have a crush on me which she had in start. I want to know if its that easy for girls to lose feelings for a guy.  \nShe always considered her thoughts as truth and I always struggled with it. She knew I don't have anyone in my life as I don't get along with my life and Im a full time trader and have other business as well to manage and she knew how stressed I used to be in life but I never felt any care from her side.  \nIts been more than 3 months but I don't know why I am still not sure whether I should approach her again or she has actually lost everything she had for me.  \nAny advice will be highly appreciated as I feel stuck in my life right now.",

      "title": "My (21F) ex (22m) of nearly 2 years has been showing genuine change but I’m not sure about how I feel.",
      "content": "[TL;DR] My ex was subbing to OF girls despite me considering it cheating. We were broken up for a few months but got in contact again after I had healed. I trust him again but i’m not sure if I will have romantic feelings again. Have you dealt with a similar situation and were you able to come back with a stronger relationship from it?  \n\nThis may be a lot of rambling but it has been on my mind for a while now. My ex boyfriend and I were together for nearly two years and honestly our relationship moved quite fast. We started dating after three weeks and moved in together after only 7 months. I was head over heels and before moving in we rarely had issues. At the time, I knew he struggled with his porn intake but I told him we would work on it together and simply asked him to come to me first. He treated me well and we had fun but that was my only issue. \n\nAfter moving in together, I started noticing a lack of intimacy after a few months and would frequently ask him if he was actively watching instead of coming to me. Let me clarify, porn isn’t an issue for me but rather the fact that I also have needs and would like for it to be a last resort and I made sure to tell him that. I also had made it clear that buying, subscribing, or following creators was an absolute no go because to me that is cheating. You may disagree but I believe having quick access to another’s nude body is definitely cheating, even if it’s not physical. \n\nWe had a massive fight in November about this and I had tried my best to work on it and heal but I simply couldn’t. After the fight he was already showing improvement and was working on being truthful but it didn’t work for me. Anyways, I ended up breaking things off and moving out in January. We didn’t talk again until March apart from occasional text about bills or the cats. \n\nIn early March I had come by to pick up the rest of my belongings and we ended up grabbing a drink and talking more which was nice since I got some closure and validation on my feelings. He had genuinely apologized for everything and explained how he understands now what I meant by it being cheating. He seemed much more open to communication and hadn’t put up a barrier, which is typically what would happen when i’d bring up difficult topics. After that night we started hanging out occasionally and he has completely quit watching porn and had been completely honest about everything. \n\nA part of me wants to believe he’s lying but I also can read him very well and he has given me full access to his phone. He has blocked porn websites and deleted any apps that he thinks would lead him to think about it. He has been introducing me to more of his friends and communicating his feelings much more. He keeps me updated on his progress and overall has been so good to me. I have started to trust him again but after the pain I went through I truly can’t tell if I can have romantic feelings for him. I know that exes are exes for a reason but he has shown so much growth and maturing. I wanted to talk again because I know relationships can come back much stronger after dealing with a hardship like that but I just feel so neutral about everything.\n\nI’ve communicated how I feel about the situation to him and he has been patient with me, but I’m afraid that I may just be leading him on or getting his hopes up. So my question is how long did it take for you to feel confident in rebuilding a relationship? Were you able to regain the same feelings? Any advice would be appreciated, but please don’t shame me for giving him another chance. I’m well aware of what I’m getting into and I have been much more adamant about my boundaries. Thanks in advance! ",

However I recently noticed my friend making eyes at him and though she didn't say it directly I could see she really likes him. I'm honestly not sure how he feels at all. Initially I was thinking of trying to spend more time with him but now that I know my friend is actively interested, I'm thinking it would be better to back off and see if he makes a move rather than initiate anything myself? I don't want him to think that I'm NOT interested but because I've realised another person likes him I think it's better to step back and gauge his level of interest if any first. Has anyone been in a similar situation or can you offer a perspective from either side? \n\nI do not want to speak to my friend about it as I can tell she is definitely interested but I can't tell if it's reciprocated. If I ask her and she says yes it would be worse or more awkward for our friendship if he doesn't reciprocate it towards her.",

My house is a small 2 bed barn conversion and I don't have a lot of space, but we're making it work. He's been trying to change things up and kind of take over a bit which I am OK with to a degree but it's still my home and I've been doing fine for 4 years on my own here with my own decorative tastes. I do feel disrespected though and always have to apologise first when we fight. For example, he's trying to quit vaping, I asked him to only vape by the door/outside and to stop doing it in bed and on the sofa. (I do it too out of habit but only a couple of times a day, he's flat out on it all the time - I have said to him we BOTH need to stop it). This lasted a day or two and he reverted back to doing it in the house and bedroom. He came back home with 2 vapes last night and I said \"that's not exactly helping you to quit\" and he blamed me saying I stress him out. I retaliated and said \"well you can eff off home then if I am the cause of your stress\". He's been in a strop ever since and said he was only joking (definitely didn't come across that way). I have told him that I am sorry but I was just annoyed with what he said. I feel disrespected in my home and IDK what to do. He's been used to living at home with his mum and she's been a bit of a smotherer. I buy all of the food (£70+ a week), do all of our washing, work 10 hours a day (50 hour weeks). I don't mind because he does pay when we dine out etc. but if I bring up any of how I am feeling it somehow always reverts to being my fault. Sorry I just needed to rant it out. I can be a handful but what do you think? ",

      "title": "I 19M have been hooking up with my ex 18F and she told me she found one of my “friends” attractive. What’s next?",
      "content": "This might be a little long but please read, it’s worth it and not slop.\n\nSo me and my ex dated for about 8 months. We broke up a month ago but still periodically see each other in weird increments. She’ll hang with me for a week and call me all day, every day, then all of the sudden get weird and drift off. Then she’ll come back even harder a week later. Anyways, she came back a couple days ago and we started seeing each other again, and she was very very touchy, and it was pretty much like we were back together. We even had sex for the first time since breaking up. We all in all had a great time, and planned bfast in the morning.\n\nThis is where everything comes in. For context, a couple weeks ago she had asked me if I had found a girl who I had known for years attractive, and I said yes, but I said I wouldn’t get with her, just yes, she’s attractive. Following this, she got extremely angry and threw a tantrum, making me drop her off.\n\nFast forward to today, and theres this guy who when we were dating I ALWAYS had a problem with. I’ve known him for like 3 years, we were pretty cool in school, I had a class with him and we sat next to each other every chance we got and worked on every project together. He would even help me out by giving me details about my ex GF cheating my junior year, and hung out many times due to having lots of mutual friends, we were in the same friend group too. However after school, I didn’t see him as much, just occasionally at hangouts. But she sat next to him in class this year (they’re a year below me) and she’d come home telling me eeeeevery day “Omg ***** told me this” or, “You’ll never believe what ***** was telling me”, and he even once talked shit about me to her.\n\nI’m from Chicago and every year I wear a Packers jersey to the St. Patricks Day Parade, and last year when I went I had zero people say anything to me. But this year, when I went with him and our friends, I had like 5 different groups of people try to “press” me about me being a Packers fan. Anyways, she told me the next day at school he was talking to her and class and goes “OP is such a fucking dumbass for wearing a Packers jersey in the city.” Subtle, but enough to raise eyebrows.\n\nI always had a feeling about this guy, she’d be liking his Instagram posts too and I just felt super uncomfortable, I even talked to her about it at one point it was that bad. Anyways, tonight after we hung out we were on the phone and she had brought up how he was hitting on her. I asked how, and she said he was on vacation and he was sending her videos and texting back and forth with her. It got to the point to where I asked her, do you “mess” with him? And she kept saying “I don’t know”, even after asking specifically yes or no. So I asked her, lets say you two are at a party. He makes a move on you. Are you getting with him?\n\nShe says, “Honestly, yeah.”\n\nIt crushed me. Yes I know I might have called a girl attractive, but I haven’t spoken to her in years and would never get with her. She was also never a problem in our relationship, unlike him. I got super upset, and felt so betrayed hearing it. I viewed her as an angel not too long ago and now I’m hearing that. I feel like I may be overreacting but I feel so hurt right now. \n\nI told her tonight after I calmed down, either you block him or you block me. My reasoning to her was I was literally inside you tonight and you want to be all touchy feely, going to breakfast tomorrow and calling me all day but at the same time hitting up my friend who you you would hook up with. I know we’re not together but that’s just outright disrespectful and disgusting to me. I’m thinking about cutting her off altogether, but like I said I still have feelings and that’d be really hard to do. Would you stick with it, or cut her off?\n\n🚨🚨‼️EDIT: If you feel me not wanting to mess with her, especially like THAT, if she is talking to my friend, is somehow controlling, feel free to do so but keep the personal attacks out of it.\n\nI never FORCED her to block him, I just told her hey, if you want to be messing with me like this essentially, you can either stop talking to him for good or stop talking to me for good. I don’t see how that’s wrong at all.",

Its important to note that I don’t mean light flirting or anything like that, they will down right say they would like to fuck or go on a date. Multiple instances where the female friends were even in a relationship. \n\nIm not really the type to accept this kind of behaviour and when I was single I would still decline these offers as I cared more about the friendship. Since I’ve been in a relationship this situation has happened 4-5 (all my female friends) times which I have always been upfront with my partner and terminated those friendships quickly. I don’t go out of my way to make female friends. \n\nIts gotten pretty bad where if a girl actually starts being nice with me, I automatically tense up in fear of them trying something. My male friends and my partner have seen me interact with these people in the past and have said I haven’t done anything to suggest I would be ok with this behaviour. Has anybody dealt with this before? Is it just impossible to have friends of the opposite sex? ",

      "content": "\n*unhappy - spelling error on title, oops\nJust a little back story, we have been dating for over 3 years. He makes me laugh, listens to me and also is my ride or die. Recently, we have hit a rough patch and have been disagreeing on a lot of things and going to sleep angry and upset. Sometimes I feel alone in the relationship because the communication isn’t there and the disrespect is becoming more and more apparent. He feels insecure because I haven’t initiated sex in a long time too. To be honest, I am not an initiator and have never been in all my previous relationships whereas, my bf does want me to be and feels I don’t like him because of it. When he brings up intimacy, he does it in a way where I don’t feel good. It’s almost porn-ish, it lacks a sense of love and I need to be emotionally invested in order to be aroused. I also don’t want to deny him every time just because he isn’t good at initiating in the manner that I like which isn’t much btw. A couple of neck kisses or touch is all I need and he forgets it when it comes to the deed. But, we have been together till now, overcoming a lot of battles and our parents are involved where - in asian households, once you introduce your bf, they act like you both need to get married asap. I’m feeling stressed, annoyed, lonely and sad really because i want it to work but i feel like when I bring up improvements that we could do, he doesn’t really hear me out. Any advice is appreciated!",

Then he came to me telling how he felt that something was off. We started working on our relationship and the fights just vanished. Now, he realized that the feeling of something being \"off\" is because he doesn't see a future together anymore. In the past, we talked about moving abroad, living there and moving back to out home country eventually to settle down (getting married and having kids). He also wants to start his own business. Before I was in this picture but now, he would want to do the moving abroad and starting a business alone and doesn't want to think about marriage and having kids with anyone right now.\n\nThe weird thing is that he doesn't know why his view of the future changed. He doesn't want to break up and he tells me he couldn't ask more from me. In his words \"his feelings about the future don't make any sense because I'm the perfect partner for him\".\n\nI feel like I can try and wait for a little bit (1-2 months) to see, how everything turns out since I kind of understand him. I would be lying if I said that I have been feeling 100% sure about him the whole time. He wants his mind to be clear first and right now he's a bit all over the place.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nDo you think it's a problem that could be solved or do you think it's a doomed relationship? \n\nDo you think I should wait for a little bit or cut it off immediately?",

      "content": "I met her in September. She was charming, attentive, and seemed genuinely interested in me. After two months of dating, I asked her to be my girlfriend, and she said yes. By mid-November, we were officially together.\n\nEverything seemed perfect at first. She took care of me, was affectionate, and made me feel special. But subtle red flags began to emerge. She displayed jealousy over my past relationships and questioned me about places I’d been before we met. If I mentioned a restaurant or bar I’d visited, she’d immediately ask, “Who were you with?” I felt compelled to be honest, but my answers often led to arguments.\n\nShe started spending more time at my place, eventually suggesting we move in together. I agreed, thinking it was a natural progression. She moved out of her apartment and into mine. However, her behavior became increasingly volatile. Minor disagreements would escalate into shouting matches. She’d throw objects, slam doors, and call me derogatory names. I expressed my discomfort, emphasizing the need for calm discussions. She attributed her reactions to past trauma from an abusive relationship and promised to change.\n\nDespite her assurances, the pattern continued. Six months into our relationship, during a trip, we had a disagreement. She contradicted previous commitments about our future, stating she wanted a partner who could provide a luxurious lifestyle without her contributing financially. I expressed that our goals no longer aligned and suggested we part ways. In response, she physically assaulted me, choking me while hurling insults. I was shocked and deeply hurt.\n\nAfter the incident, I ended the relationship, but she remained in my apartment, claiming she still loved me. She accused me of being controlling because I inquired about her day or asked if she arrived safely at her destinations. I never restricted her movements or dictated her choices. I was merely concerned for her well-being.\n\nI’m sharing this story to seek perspective. Was I truly being controlling, or was she manipulating the narrative? I’m trying to understand the dynamics of what happened and would appreciate any insights or advice.",

For most of that time, we were both in school, which meant we had plenty of time to spend together. But everything changed recently, as he just started a demanding corporate job with hours from 7:30 AM to 7:30 PM.\n\nFor context, we’re currently living with his parents and siblings while I search for a job. The search has been tough, so I’m at home most of the day with his mom and sister. When he finally gets home, he’s understandably exhausted, and his whole family wants his attention too. I barely get a moment with him, and when I do, he’s drained.\n\nLately, I’ve been having panic attacks as soon as he walks through the door. I don’t fully understand what’s happening with me, and I feel terrible about it. I find myself crying or feeling overwhelmed, which I know is starting to affect our relationship. He feels like I’m being unfair, like I’m upset while he’s working so hard for both of us, and I completely get that. I know he’s under a lot of stress, and I don’t want to add to it. But I still feel incredibly lonely and disconnected.\n\nWhat makes it harder is that we don’t talk at all during the day, so when he’s finally home, I’m not just sharing my time with him, I’m also sharing it with his whole family. It’s been emotionally really difficult, and I’m not sure how to cope with these changes or express my feelings without making things harder for him too.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this, and how did you navigate it without damaging your relationship?",

      "content": "I had this posted in r/relationships and it was removed with no explanation so if you're seeing this a second time I apologize.\n\nHas anyone else dealt with / (is currently going through these issues with their significant other? And what have you done?\n\nTo preface I (30F) am self-employed. My income varies on a monthly basis but all necessities, bills, and personal get covered. Now my boyfriend (35M), unemployed (by choice), former vet with PTSD that causes him to have random explosive angry outbursts about small inconveniences. I can usually deal with these and I'm sympathetic to everything he has been through (also aware of the US's poor handling of veterans and I have heard some absolute horror stories but that's a discussion for a different subreddit).\n\nHe comes from a wealthy family and is given a set amount of funds per month to use on anything he wants, and has very little bills. We've been together a year now but are facing some obstacles.\n\nSo, keeping in mind of the details stated above, here are the dilemma:\n\nMy boyfriend enjoys frequent (practically every day) outings that typically cost money which can range based on where we go. Me (not wanting to mooch off of his money, because that was never the intention upon dating him) always tried to go 50/50 in the beginning when we'd go out. However, as time progressed and we started seeing eachother more it's become difficult to keep up financially because it's a daily occurrence for him to spend money and I'm unable to do that; so when that happens he will end up covering my portions. While I enjoy going out, I have firmly stated that I do not need to indulge everyday; being homebodies, enjoying each other's company for free is fine with me.\n\nNow he's stated multiple times that he doesn't mind covering for me when needed. But two days ago an outburst argument involving my work schedule occurred and for some reason he was unreasonably angry I was taking this client for 2 days. He screamed that it was too far (she's 50 min away), stated I was stupid and my job was stupid (he repeated \"it's stupid\" over and over again every time I asked him why he was upset). I've taken this client many times before and this isn't something new and he has no interaction with them and he has nothing to do with my job whatsoever. Also it isn't a scheduling conflict as we had nothing planned. Frankly, I'm not sure why he's angry.\n\nSuddenly it switched to him making a statement (in pure anger) about me being a \"burden\" later down the road as he has to constantly \"pay too much\" for me. Of all the comments he's made, this one really hurt. I've compromised so much to make things work during our time together, especially when money is involved. I previously bought all groceries and tried to cook and planned more affordable dates which I stopped doing because the food was going uneaten/to waste and the dates (he had agreed to/shown interest in) were canceled in favor of something else he wanted to do. Every spare cent I have not earmarked for bills goes to outings. So I am trying my best here.\n\n I told him I have nothing left to give him financially or emotionally. I am not purposely draining his bank account because (as stated above) that was never my intention in this relationship. \n\nSince that argument I left his place and we've had no communication with one another. I'm at a standstill on what my next course of action should be and that's why I've come here for advice. And I want to be clear I am not happy about how he expresses his anger but I am more concerned about WHAT was said. Thank you in advance Reddit users.\n\nTL;DR We have an income disparity and he has said some hurtful things and I'm not sure how to proceed. ",

      "content": "I (25f) have been feeling so lonely lately. My boyfriend (28m) is constantly staring at a screen and I feel like he’d rather do that than spend any time with me. Everyday when I come home from work, around 5:30, he is already logged onto his PC and is either playing video games or watching YouTube videos etc. He gets home before I do everyday so by the time I get home he’s already been on the computer for a few hours. He spends the whole night on it…. Minus bathroom breaks and also supper time which we usually do eat together. But after supper he’s back on the computer for the rest of the night. I go to bed around 10:00 and I’d say 95% of the time he comes to bed after I’m already asleep. Also every weekend he is logged on not long after he gets up and is on all day until bed time. All he ever wants to do is stare at a screen… I make the effort to come sit with him while he games every night but I don’t like staying for long because he usually has his headset on and talking to friends so I just feel like I’m interrupting when I speak. So I just go and read my book for the evening until I’m ready for bed. He might come check on me once during that point but it’s quick. Now, don’t get me wrong, I LOVE reading and I have multiple other hobbies that I enjoy so I’m not bored. I also make the time to get out of the house and spend time with my friends. But for this to be the routine just about every night is really bothering me.\n\nI have brought his up to him multiple times at this point and have said it a few different ways. That I feel like he would rather stare at a screen than spend any time with me, that I feel lonely, that I feel like I’m doing everything by myself etc.  To top this all off, I’ve recently been diagnosed with cancer and am having my surgery next week. I have a million things to do and prepare for before surgery so I feel like I’m dealing with all of this on my own. Like I said, I do have friends that I can talk to about things so I do have a good support system but damn… I really feel like he doesn’t care about me.\n\nI don’t know what to do. Is there still a chance that this can be fixed or will it stay like this? I’m really starting to lose any hope for this relationship and am getting resentful.",

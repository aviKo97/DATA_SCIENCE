I cannot think of a context where  I'd want to find myself doing that.\n      \nTo that end, when people make suggestions, it helps massively for them to include the \"why\" behind their suggestion.

Iceberg and romaine lettuce shouldn't be bitter and you can make a perfectly good salad with just them. Add some carrot, onion, green pepper...really any veggie you like raw and a bit of dressing.\n\nThe dressing can be brutal as far as health goes, though. 100g of Ranch Dressing is 484 calories vs 100g of literal cheesecake which is 321 calories. And not all calories are created equal, that's for sure. But if you already dislike salads looking into veggies alternatives is better than smothering something in way too much fat and sugar to make yourself life it.\n\nYou don't have to like salad to eat healthy :)",

I always keep a tube of Pilsbury Biscuit dough in the fridge (or w/e brand. I honestly didn't know how to reference what I meant without using the brand name). It is literally raw dough that has already been properly risen and proofed.\n\nStuffed pork buns, the dumplings in chicken and dumpling soup (STRONGLY recommend), \"Pork Wellington\", I made scrabbled eggs and bacon and stuffed some to bake into breakfast buns. It works very well and is WAY faster than homemade dough if you don't need a specific type of bread. I don't have a pic of the other dishes but here is my Wellington lol And use the more buttery Crescent Roll dough if you're making a dessert.\n\nOK I can't figure out how to link a pic from my PC but trust me when I say it is very pretty. And yes, because it requires zero effort on my part for a high-effort food I consider it a tool lol",

Boil for a few minutes, add some chicken cut into small bite sized pieces - can use raw or leftover cooked chicken, if you have any lying around. Turn the heat down and let the chicken poach. Meanwhile, in a second saucepan, prepare a very light roux - no colour, just cook the flour flavor out. Add cream to the roux to make a thick, rich white sauce and combine with the chicken and veg stew. Season with salt, pepper, nutmeg. Lastly, return the asparagus to the stew. It's basically an easier cheat version of chicken fricassee.\n\n\nFor green: Split down the middle and sautee in a pan with shallots and a generous amount of butter. The cut sides get a nice browning on. Drop a few cherry tomatoes into the pan, they will pop and give the whole dish acidity. Add bacon bits if desired, season with just salt and pepper. Serve with a pan fried pork medallion or a piece of chicken and a creamy cheesy polenta.",

Same with any galette or crumble.\n\nIf you must have chocolate, maybe do tiny servings of a really rich dark chocolate mousse.\n\nIntense yet tiny is also the thing for many Middle Eastern desserts: baklava, Dubai chocolate, halva, kanafeh, cheese and honey stuffed dates, etc.\n\nIt doesn‚Äôt get more texturally and flavor varied than halo halo.

Also, if you ever want Chinese dishes that are vegetarian. I would reccomend going on tiktok & YouTube for that. \n\nAlso, you don‚Äôt need fancy meats to make Korean soups. A lot of Korean meals use vegetarian mandu, spam, canned tuna, or whatever protein you have in the fridge. I will link some Korean soups that use vegetaian and different proteins for examples: \n\n**Jjigae recipes that are so easy to switch or add the meats or take out the meat completely from the soups:** \\\n[jjigae ](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjaxCocf/) \\\n[doenjang jjigae take out meat from the recipe](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjaxtFX5/) \n\n[tuna jjigae switch meat or take out the meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjaxX3Cy/) \\\n[vegetarian Sundubu](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxrHwRu/) \\\n[pork belly subdubu take out meat or sub different meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxraHmX/) \n\n[beef Sundubu take out the meat or sub different meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxr5oWe/) \\\n[big pot subdubu take out meat or sub different meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxrMjEJ/) \\\n[veggie kimchi jjigae](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTj4xjgdk/) \\\n[beef kimchi jjigae take out meat or sub different meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxr6KhC/) \\\n[tuna kimchi jjigae take out meat or sub different meat](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTjxrrBDA/)\n\nAlso, most Korean sauces, Doenjang, gochujang, and ssamjang can be used in fusion dishes. I saw doenjang be used in Korean pasta dishes. And gochujang used in vodka pasta. Also, bibimbap is a Korean dish that has protein, rice, and veggies. If you don‚Äôt want meat, you can use airfried marinated tofu. Also, buy vegan kimchi cause regular kimchi is not vegan at all. But if you can‚Äôt find one: \\ \n[kimchi](https://youtu.be/XAyApmw00eo?si=wXnDvDiO8o32AwR7) \\\n[kimchi recipe in website](https://youtube.com/shorts/I3VfXEP-ZHw?si=ONM4Tv10sFYSZP33) \\\n[kimchi 3](https://youtu.be/NFyNP623bt0?si=O0RCSrnSVZXmHTRA) \\\n[cucumber kimchi](https://youtu.be/xoeTnyebdtQ?si=ahaRKEy_NDVtHyN0) \\\nBut the Asian store should have some vegan selections.",

You can also rehydrate dried shitake mushrooms and use the mushroom water to add umami. The Japanese would use that water to make a dashi stock.\n\nGet familiar with the flavours and smells of Asian spices and aromatics: ginger, shallots, spring onions; lemongrass, galangal, keffir lime, chillis, thai or sweet basil; star anise, cinnamon, black cardamom, black and white pepper; black and white sesames, peanuts etc.\n\nBe open to trying new cooking styles like steaming, braising and simmering.\n\nThe main method of thickening saucey dishes is a teaspoon or two of cornstarch in a small puddle of water (cornstarch slurry) that is added to your dish at the end of your cooking and mixed in while everything is hot.\n\n*Since my cooking is primarily Cantonese, on Cantonese Chinese dishes:*  \nThe main philosophy focuses on **the quality and aroma** of your ingredients.

Some places were easy (India, Italy, France) and others we gave up and ordered pizza (Siberia) - but we had a great time every week, and it expanded my culinary horizons even more than moving to another country did. I think part of what made it work so well for me was that I didn't have to pick the cuisine - the Race producers essentially did that for me - my job was to research the cuisine of a pre-determined place, pick something that looked appetizing and manageable, and then muddle my way though it.

        "body": "What a great post! Definitely I‚Äôll make some of the dishes that people have commented! Here is mine, just a classic Spanish omelette (tortilla de patatas). A quick recipe: \n\n1. Take 3 potatoes, peel and make thin slices.\n2. Fry them in olive oil, medium heat. Not air fry, not boiled. Fry them as god intended. They are ready when they have slightly brown edges. Put them aside on a strainer. \n3. Take half a white onion and do the same. Bonus points if you have the patience to caramelise it. \n4. Wait so that the onions and potatoes are not super hot, mix them and start adding eggs and scramble them with the mix. I would say 5 eggs but it depends on the eggs and the potatoes, so just add eggs until the mix is more liquid than solid. Break the potatoes, the idea is to have little pieces in there. \n5. Salt\n6. Select a pan. This pan has to be the diameter of the tortilla. Maybe 18-20 cm. It depends on the mixture, just go smaller than you think. It is best to have a tall tortilla than a thin one. Put a thin layer of olive oil. \n7. On medium high heat pour the mixture and sake it a bit. Leave it for 1-2 minutes top, check that it is not sticking. Put a plate on top of the pan and flip it in a single movement. Best if you see a video online for technique. \n8. Put it again on the pan carefully and sake the pan just a bit to round it. Wait a minute or so and it‚Äôs done!\n\nThe ideal consistency is creamy and juicy inside, but there is a lot of debate about this topic.",

You can also go the East Asian route with garlic, ginger, soy sauce and sugar.\n- Different cuts of pork, either as \"steaks\" or skewers, also well seasoned (salt, pepper, garlic, lemon and rosemary are a favorite)\n- Fattier fish like whole salmon, dorade, seabass, sardines. For the larger fish, gut them and stuff the insides with slices of onion, lemon and minced garlic, add some herbs like parsley and dill\n- Cherry tomatoes on the vine, grill and pop them off, season with salt, olive oil and pepper, mash and spread on bread\n- Bell peppers also work great on the grill. I personally hate them but definitely add them to your repertoire if you like them\n- Whole potatoes and onions wrapped in foil directly on the coals\n- Whole aubergines charred then placed in a bag to \"steam\", peel and season to taste, also great with bread and crackers\n- Halved aubergines and courgettes, brush flat side with oil, grill flat side down, flip and score flat side, brush with your choice of glaze (miso ginger with some mirin, garlic and Italian herbs with olive oil and balsamic vinegar) and let them \"cook\" in the seasoning\n- Shimeji mushrooms wrapped in foil, add a pad of butter on top and soy sauce before closing the packet\n- Oyster mushrooms marinaded overnight in seasoning so they're nice and pliable, skewer and grill. Excellent \"meat substitute\" for the vegetarians, great texture\n- Okra is GLORIOUS grilled. If you can get the tender Indian ladyfingers that's best. Skewer, brush with oil and grill. Sprinkle salt and pepper\n- Asparagus - use the same method as the okra\n- Grilled onigiri! \n- Halloumi - it's my go-to substitute of a Brazilian white cheese we usually grill. Serve with a drizzle of hot honey\n- Homemade garlic bread\n- Pointed cabbage wedges - another one that loves a healthy brush of miso ginger glaze\n- Grilled corn, also a good carb option. Serve them Mexican street corn style for extra oomph\n- For the most adventurous days: chicken hearts (a Brazilian barbecue classic, use the same seasoning I recommended) and beef heart, thinly sliced (anticuchos). Argentinians also grill some other offal like liver, kidneys and tripe but I'm not a fan.\n\nDessert:\n- Pineapple slices, dust with cinnamon sugar before serving. Vanilla ice cream scoops optional\n- Whole bananas, grilled in the peel until they're nice and soft. Also serve with cinnamon sugar and some ice cream\n- Halved and pitted peaches - this one benefits more from a light drizzle of honey\n- Halved and cored apples, stuff the core hole with butter, cinnamon and sugar, wrap in foil and bake",

Does it actually work?\n\nNo... just no. These are all arbitrary numbers to make it seem meaningful. Honestly, don't look for any practical advice from a platform that is only concerned about your engagement. \n\nIt's easy to plan your grocery list, all you have to do is plan your meals and the grocery list builds itself. Take one hour every week, on a day off, and do a quick audit of your fridge, freezer, and pantry. Now go to your favorite recipe website and search for recipes that use the ingredients that you already have, and are also within your means. Now you build your grocery list from that. If you stick to just one or two sources for your recipes, you will find that they tend to use the same ingredients across many different recipes, and not in a restrictive way. It just makes it easier to keep things on-hand and know what is or isn't available at your local grocery store, especially when it comes to fresh produce.\n\nEventually, you will build up a pool of recipes that you can then cycle through and you won't even have to check your fridge/freezer/pantry anymore because you'll be so used to what you always have on-hand. Your grocery list should consist mostly of fresh produce, meat, and dairy. If you're vegan, then obviously you don't have to worry about meat and dairy, so it's even easier. You buy pantry staples when you are low, not when you are out. Treat it like inventory at a restaurant.\n\nAlso, be realistic about your cooking. I only plan meals for Sunday-Thursday because I know that I'm usually not going to be cooking on Friday and Saturday nights. And consider how much time you want to spend cooking as well. Consider cleaning as part of your cooking time.",

I'm also quite good at pulling ingredients together to make a meal.\n\nWe have a lot of storecupboard stuff (spaghetti, linguine, mezze rigatoni, orecchiette, orzo, few types of lentils, few types of rice, few other grains knocking about), we buy EVOO by the 2L can and have a well-stocked oil/vinegar/spices drawer. So every shop I'll be restocking anything there running low (and sometimes adding something else).\n\nBut then I buy... absolutely tons of veg. I cook my supermarket shop what a friend calls 'micro-seasonality' - we use the things that go off quicker first (leafy salads, broccolini, green beans, asparagus), then through to the medium-term veg (think broccoli, kale, mushrooms), and finishing off with some of the hardier stuff (cabbage, cauliflower, carrots, sweet potatoes). Of course, I'm not slavishly devoted to this - I'll happily have a cauliflower green bean curry in that earlier bit. And I'm also very gung ho about eating veg that might look a little sad (but absolutely is not off) - I'll just make sure it's e.g. roasted rather than going in a salad.\n\nOn top of that, we eat a lot of beans, tofu, some tempeh. When I do buy animal protein (I have a child and she, like me, eats a mix) I do have to prioritise cooking and eating it earlier in the process, like salmon. I batch cook chicken for her and freeze it in slices so I defrost slices as and when in later meals for her. And we eat some tinned fish together too (have found some truly excellent tinned mackerel, and good quality tuna is great too).\n\nWriting it down it sounds pretty joyless, but I find it gives me something to focus on (what needs eating next) to build meals around, it means we spend so much less money on food (I'm in the UK - our last shop was just under ¬£200 and lasted us about 3 weeks - we are a family of 3), I don't really have to change my supermarket shop week on week in terms of the veg and protein I'm buying because it's basically the same thing each time with some seasonal variation, and it means I eat a really enormous range of vegetables rather than just zeroing in on the ones that form the backbone of some of my go-to meals (the ideal is to aim for 30 plants/legumes etc a week).",

It is actually [much lower on the Glycemic index](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26693746/) after it's been cooked and frozen, so it's a much better option for anyone with blood sugar issues.\n\nI make big batches of Jasmine or Sushi rice in my instant pot, then portion them out into little 150g pucks. I put them in a bunch of old yogurt containers and stack them to make them uniform, but there are lots of options to make single portions.\n\nWhen reheating, add a small amount of water (like 1-2 tsp), and make sure the rice is covered.

It‚Äôs very nuanced and may take you some experimenting. \n\nI personally haven‚Äôt had a hard time freezing either and I do meal prep for both my parents and grandmother who live with me and prepare rice (and quinoa) and pasta weekly for freezing. \n\nHowever I prepare and plate the meats and veggies in individual storage containers, but leave the starches out of the containers. They heat those up separate from main meal. \n\nSo I suggest maybe trying a few methods based on brands you buy and methods you use. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find the best way. \n\nFor rices, i prepare it in my instant pot. I make plain Goya medium grain white rice and mahatma organic brown rice this way and it works very well. I fill up a qt size baggie to the brim, push all the air out and seal it. My directions for them for heat up straight from freezer, is break off how much you want in a small bowl, and microwave with wet paper towel over it. \n\nFor pasta, I always make sure to cook it exactly al dente, not a second more, and add the sauce, then freeze it in individual serving containers by itself. I normally only serve it with a marinara variation or pesto. For some reason, butter and cream based sauces don‚Äôt do well for me for meal prep (perhaps because these sauces from scratch don‚Äôt have artificial stuff to keep them together upon reheat.) My directions for straight from freezer is heat up the whole individual portion, at 50% power with a stir at half time.\n\nI hope this encourages you to try some different methods for both prep, how it‚Äôs stored, and how to reheat. There‚Äôs definitely a way to do it well :)",

I've been putting it under the broiler, but it's also very good  cooked in a pan with butter, especially. Maybe I'm just weird? I don't know, bread is good fresh, but I honestly think it might be even better cooked again??\"\n   \nYou're absolutely right. They need more heat and time for the collagenous tissues to deteriorate and dissolve. That stuff then buffers the cooking, and prevents the meat from drying out untold it reaches 200F. I take mine out anywhere 185-195. It makes a difference the exact temperature, but not as much as with fish or chicken breast, which can seemingly go almost all the way from undercooked to overcooked in such a big span of temperatures. \n   \nNot so with thighs. They are forgiving. I recommend staying at 375F or below even if you have the time. 350 is worth it compared to 375, in my opinion, but below that I haven't experimented. It takes more time, which is the reason the result is better. Cooking slower gives the collagen and whatnot time to get wrecked and cough up the goods to the proteins and whatnot and give them time to cook in turn and such. It's a domino effect that benefits from more time.\n         \nAnyway, congrats/good job! Well reasoned.\n   \nBtw: I recommend undercooking 5 degrees or so and then finishing under the broiler for the skin to crisp! Remember it will cook another 3-5 degrees after removing from the oven. Hence why I aim for 195 max, to avoid it going above 200 much if at all--overcooking territory.",

Cook until they are browning slightly and then set aside on a plate. \n\nNext thing is to make the sauce. Very finely diced onion to start, saute until translucent, add in a pinch of salt to help them cook more quickly and bring out more flavour (can go further and caramlise them if you want more flavour, but I like having the small pieces of onion visible in the sauce with a little bite). Add in 300ml cream and 200ml-ish glass of white wine , lots of black pepper and some parsley, and salt to taste. Bring to a simmer and reduce for 5-10 minutes until alcohol has boiled off. \n\nCook pasta. When sauce is complete, stir pasta through the sauce evenly, I used spaghetti last time I made it because that's what I had. Spaghetti works well with the thick sauce but if you prefer thinner sauces use pasta shells or something like that and don't reduce the sauce for too long.\n\nPan fry salmon fillets skin-side down, starting from a cold pan building up to a high heat on the hob. Once the skin comes away from the pan easily and you can see the flesh of the salmon is halfway cooked (the half closest to the bottom of the pan will go paler with a slightly cream-pink colour) then turn and cook the other side, which shouldn't need as long.\n\nDoing this from memory as can't find where I wrote the recipe down. It was one I made when I bought some reduced salmon fillets and needed to make a quick dish around it. Salmon is pretty forgiving when compared to other fish, but is worth looking up a proper chef's advice on how to cook it if you make this dish.\n\nHope whatever you end up cooking ends up being tasty, and your friend likes it :)",

If you‚Äôre not a fan of chicken, you can also get it with paneer.  Which is cubes of a very mild medium-firmness cheese.  It has very little actual flavor, and a texture more like firm tofu.   Paneer is made from fresh milk in about 24 hours or so, which is why it has so little flavor.   It‚Äôs just firm milk!   The dish (chicken or paneer) should be mild, but you may want to specify just in case.  \n\nAnother standard dish to try would be dahl (lentils).  My personal preference is makahni dahl, which is a slightly darker richer (more flavorful) dahl.  Neither are normally spicy.  Again you may want to specify you want to everything to be mild!\n\nAloo Gobi  - Aloo is potato. Gobi is cauliflower.  It is a mildly spiced baked potato and cauliflower dish.  They will likely say it is in a ‚Äúgravy‚Äú which only means a fairly thick (dry) sauce.  Delicious.  Safe.   Mild.  \n\nMy wife, a vegetarian, likes a Malay/Malai Kofta.\nIt‚Äôs a bit of a veggie patty in a nice creamy sauce.  Also mild.  Delicious.\n\nDefinitely get the naan bread.  Most people will say either get garlic or cheese naan or both. Our favorite is the combined garlic and cheese Naan. \n\nThe rice should be either plain steamed basmati rice (long grain and fluffy.) or it may be saffron rice. Witch is just colored yellow, which is from the saffron, which is more about the color than the flavor, which is extremely mild anyway.\n\nYou could have a Samosa, which is basically a deep fried pastry pyramid formed around a dry potato and pea mixture.  It‚Äôs basically an Indian meat pie, but with no meat.   Usually served with a small side of a mint and yogurt dip. Not usually spicy.  Ask. \n\nYou might get some papad or papadum thrown in for free  (they are the same thing).  They are deep-fried lentil wafers ‚Äì the equivalent of an Indian nacho chip.   Not spicy. Yummy. probably also served with a yogurt and mint dip.",

See which one works best. Also see if you can prepare a mint, cilantro chutney to serve on the side. Hope this helps.",

When it overcooks it becomes tough and dry.\n\nFor stirfry, slice the chicken very thinly.  Saute over very high heat just till the outside gets a bit of browning on it - maybe 4 minutes tops.  Remove the chicken to a plate, then cook the veggies - also over very high heat till just browning a bit.  Add in the sauce mixture and continue stirring the veggies just till the sauce has thickened.  Add in the chicken, stir and cook for 1-2 minutes more - you don't want the veggies to go all soft and wilty.  And it's done!  Thinly sliced chicken in a super hot pan cooks very quickly.\n\nIf you are using cubed chicken pieces instead of thinly sliced, saute for no more than 5 minutes on super high heat, remove from the pan and toss the veggies for 2-3 minutes.  Then add the sauce AND the chicken pieces back into the pan and cook and stir till the sauce is bubbly and thickened - about 3 minutes.\n\nFor a curry you'll want to use chicken thighs if possible and once the entire curry ingredients are in the pan, reduce the heat to low and simmer for at least 30 minutes to get all the flavor out of the spices as possible.  By simmering gently, the chicken doesn't get tough.",

You want them with a delicate bite to them - not crunchy, but not a stodgy mess that's falling apart. Just the right level of firmness.\n- Using fresh and high quality ingredients for the dressing. Think high quality vinegars, fresh cracked pepper, and fresh herbs instead of dry (dill, tarragon, parsley, green onion., etc)\n- Adding a bit of mustard or instead of just vinegar for added depth and a slight kick that fits neatly within the flavor profile while still adding complexity.\n- Adding a bit of sugar to temper the acidity while retaining the flavour that it brings.\n- Adequate (but not too much) salt, both in the dressing *and* in the potatoes. Which can be achieved through salted cooking water or letting the potatoes sit in the dressing for an extended period.\n\n\nThere are of course modifications that can play on these classic flavors, so potato salad has a huge potential range, but the idea is the same - flavors should be distinct from one another, while still blending in on the edges and remaining in balance, the right mix of fats and acids for balanced richness and \"vertical\" components to add more depth and¬† complexity.",

Green onions, cheese, sour cream are classics but you could also tailor toppings to your protein flavorings. Make salsa, add black beans, cilantro, onion for a Mexican style night. \n\nMaking sauces/dips that work in multiple dishes\n- romesco can be used with roasted/grilled veg, on sandwich, on potatoes, on any of the above with rice, with pasta\n- hummus: you can make a big plain batch and add different seasonings in smaller batches, make hummus bowls (hummus on the bottom, add rice, beans, and veg)\n- black bean dip: blitz black beans with cumin, salt, lemon or lime, until smooth. Can be used as a dip, base of a grain bowl, or in sandwiches or wraps.\n- pesto/chimichurri like sauces: herbs and other greens can make great sauces (greens + garlic + onion is a great base and add oil/vinegar/citrus/yogurt to fit what you have on hand)\n\nGrain bowls\n- endless options! Switch up the grains, veg, and protein and add sauces as you have ingredients available. You can cook the grains in broth or add seasonings before cooking to add more flavor. Hummus and romesco (or pesto or another bean dip) give you a ton of options. You can use veg raw (including lettuce, arugula , etc.) or cook them (served warm or room temp) and these bowls are a great way to use up leftovers.\n\nI'd also recommend looking into gardening (if that's an option!) and even just an herb garden can give you a lot of variety. There's a lot of produce that people typically throw away that's edible so it's worth looking into that too. I've made a carrot top pesto and carrot top tabbouleh before that turned out well!",

However, their chicken salad with raspberry dressing was hauntingly delicious. \n\nThey oven roasted the chicken, then grill before hand shredding. It was seasoned with simple salt pepper garlic, onion, paprika and I‚Äôm sure maybe one or two other ingredients. They house made the mayo. They also added raisin, not ordinary raisins but grape juice soaked raisins. They were so juice and amazing. Then the raspberry dressing was also house made. Assuming a simple syrup base with raspberries and some salt with a little oil were emulsified. \n\nSo when you were served, it literally just looked like a scoop of chicken salad over some basic ass lettuce. It was not! They actually had to take it off the menu because it was too popular & not a main entree. \n\nAnyway, stuff like simple prepping at night for soaked raisins in chicken salad, house making dressings, fully understanding the science behind ingredients and bringing out their full flavour all go into making restaurants exceptional. \n\nFor instance if you‚Äôve ever had Chinese beef broccoli, it‚Äôs so tender and scrumptious. The trick is deep frying the beef covered in baking soda first to basically explode the fibers and soften the meat. \n\nReally depends on specific dishes & knowing different techniques. Restaurants have a lot of time depending on how many chefs / cooks they have working the kitchen for prep, ideas, techniques, plating that make it seem super simple ‚Äú20minutes or less‚Äù. reality is it may have taken literal generations to perfect a recipe.",

They are stored, perfectly safely, in refrigeration, but that early prep gives the food time to lose some of its water content and concentrate the flavor.¬†\n\n\nPrepped fruits and vegetables are stored in containers isolating them from picking up flavors from other foods. Prepped meat is fully bled, and drained with less water content. They use cheap meat that with more fat around the edges evwn if there is less internal marbling. Meat is pre-seasoned and marinated at least overnight for deeper flavor. Grains are rinsed to remove dust and chafe then soaked overnight before cooking the next day. Beans (if cooked from scratch) are soaked multiple times to remove more polysacharrides before cooking.\n\n\nFood is cooked in/on primarily stainless steel at high heat with gas stoves to create a depth of flavor with maillard reactions and lower water leaching. Low heat cooking causes more water to be expelled from foods as it cooks and most home pans nowadays are nonstick which can't handle high heat. Home stoves are mostly electric in a lot of new construction and rentals/appartments. Burner heat is not consistant with electric stoves nor is it as easy to control or change as you have to wait for the radient heat to gradually adjust instead of the instant changes that come with a gas range so it's difficult to get restaurant results even if you did everything else right at home. It takes a lot of practice.\n\n\nFinally, restaurants take a lot of shortcuts with base ingredients that are developed and formulated by people who study food sciene and manufactured in factories controlled by robots for precise consistent results. Things like flour/batter mixes for fried foods, premade frozen doughs and shells for their pastries, broths/stocks for soups (sometimes entire premade soups that come canned), flavor concentrates, pastes, powders, and sauces that contain umami flavor like soy sauce, msg, yeast extractives, etc.\n\n\nAlso, a lot of recipes online are just \"made up\". They will never taste good or come out right because the creator has never actually made said recipe, just wrote a bunch of shit to make it seem real and attached a shutterstock photo to make it look like they made it as they are just trying to attract people to their blog for ad revenue.",

        "body": "I appreciate a post like this.  I've used many rings, and was once on a quest like yours and got pretty far, but then I got lazy.  Now that I'm lazy I will never go back to frying.  A lot of comments in this thread are missing the point.  A McDonalds round egg has a few signature features: A broken yolk, fried on the bottom, steamed on the top, and it must have a \"flattened cylinder\" shape.  You can make a round egg in just about anything, but it won't necessarily be a McDonald's style egg.  Those sides gotta be straight walls.  It has a certain height, shape, and texture. \n\nThe closest I've come is to use a 4\" ss ring from a commercial cookie cutter set (it's got the weight) along with butter-flavored oil, such as \"Whirl\", then squirt water on the griddle beside it and cover with a dome.  Pretty much identical, except the blackstone does give off a natural flavor since it's a lot like cast iron.  It's a good flavor but McDonalds tastes more \"sterile\" in comparison. \n\nAnother contender is using a 4\" stainless steel round cake pan and air fry the egg.   In this case it's reversed - the bottom is the soft side and the top is the \"fried\" side.  Interesting result but not quite a McDonald's egg. \n\nBut let me tell you how I'm lazy.  I microwave mine now.  The reason why microwaving eggs is generally terrible is because if you put the energy of a 1000w microwave and give it the full beans with no breaks, it's going to expand, overcook, and explode, all at the same time.\n\nWhat I've found is that if you cook at 20% power for about 4m 30s, the egg will be completely set with none of the microwavy-ness.  For the cooking vessel I have a ceramic 4\" creme brulee dish with nice straight walls and it's plain/round with no fancy design.  I only have one and I don't even know where it came from.  The microwave method has a lot of variables because every microwave is different, eggs are different weights, and the cooking vessel itself also absorbs some of that energy.  \n\nBut, out of sheer laziness that's the way I do mine now.  I eat one of these pretty much every day.  The microwave is way more approachable than trying to do it authentically, and it checks most of the boxes.  What I'm missing is the \"fried\" part, but I'm willing to give that up when I can crank out a McMuffin in 5 minutes start to finish.",

That can help you with your calorie deficit, by skipping out on whatever ingredients you want (like less cheese, limited sauce, no tortilla). \n\nWhat I like: seasoned cubed/slices chicken pan-seared in an oil of your choice (breasts are fine but thighs taste better), onions and bell peppers either saut√©ed or just slowly roasted in the oven, black beans, corn, and lettuce. Partner likes avocado or guac. For a sauce that adds moisture, I often make a cilantro lime crema by mixing 2:1 mayo and sour cream with the pan drippings from the chicken, a squeezed lime, salt, and a decent handful of cilantro. This might not work for your calorie deficit, so I recommend pico de gallo for moisture as well :) just onion, tomato, cilantro, and lime. No spicy peppers as you‚Äôve mentioned spice is off the table.",

I think what will help buffer it is putting dry lettuce (iceberg) on top and bottom of salad, and it can be shredded, just make sure its dry. \n\nMy sandwich had mustard and mayo on bottom and mayo on top, had some tomatoes, lettuce, pickled peppers ... I put the lettuce on top and deli meat on bottom, it worked out perfectly, was soft but not mushy.  Even 24 hours later.  \n\nBut that italian loaf bread is so thick, it can absorb alot.  I cant remember, i think i even pulled out a little of the bread, cause my sandwich was so thick. It might work for you...   a thin layer of say like swiss or meunster cheese on bottom may help, bit i dont think needed.\n\n\nI think you'll be fine with  italian loaf. I think you may want to pull a little bread out so that when you slice it, the chicken salad won't fall out.  \n\nI think rolls (someone mentioned Hawaiian rolls) would be great, too. May need to hold together with toothpick? I'd use one with a flag/decoration if so, so someone doesn't put in mouth;):):)  or you could quarter or make tea sandwiches out of sourdough.

Chicken is okay for iron, easy to digest and one of the cheapest proteins you can find especially if you shop hard on sales. Beef is the best source of iron but not so much that you HAVE to eat it. If you use ground beef in dishes like chili or American goulash you can adjust proportions as you adapt. I'm a fan of 80/20 beef over leaner grinds. It isn't much work to drain fats during cooking (no work at all on a barbecue grill) and lots of product benefit from the fat in the early stages of cooking. \n\n(1) Pregnant women should not eat raw oysters. Thoroughly cooked are fine. Outstanding source of iron. \n\nEggs are a reasonable source of iron. Interestingly, pork including bacon is not. \n\nNothing is simple. Everything connects to everything. Nutrition, cost, and how you feel. \n\nSome people get skeevy (<- technical term \\*grin\\*) about touching raw meat. Latex or nytrile gloves usually deal with that. \n\nMy wife and I sometimes have surf & turf nights. We make scallops for her and I eat a couple. We make steak for me and she has a couple of bites. This might be a practice that helps you transition to an omnivore. \n\nIf I understand correctly, iron levels are important for developing brains so this is a good step for all your children and not just you during your pregnancy. \n\nI'll end where I began.

All I do is saute lots of sliced onion and peppers in a little oil, then I add a mess load of raw spinach and wilt it down, adding some ground cumin, chili powder and/or pre-made fajita seasoning. Remove and set aside. In the pan I add a bit more oil and then a tortilla (flour or a flour-corn combo) then quickly a layer of shredded cheese (cheddar or pepper jack are my go-tos), then part of the veggie mixture, then cheese, then a tortilla to top. Brown and then flip and brown the other side. Serve with your favorite Tex-Mex toppings (salsa, guacamole, sour cream, cilantro, sliced green chilies, etc). I actually prefer fold over types (one tortilla filled on half and then folded) rather than full round sandwich looking ones. They are easier to flip.\n\nAnother:\n\nSpinach Bacon Pepper Quiche\n\n1 single raw pie crust (you can buy it pre-made, and thaw, if frozen)\n\n1 tbsp¬†olive oil\n\n8 oz¬†(225 g) bacon, diced small\n\n1¬†small red onion, diced small\n\n1/2 red pepper, diced small\n\nOne¬†5 oz (140 g) bag fresh spinach, roughly chopped\n\n6¬†eggs\n\n1 cup milk\n\n1 cup¬†grated cheese, divided (good options are Swiss, cheddar, Asiago, or combo with Parmesan)\n\n1/2 tsp¬†salt\n\n1/2 tsp¬†pepper\n\nPreheat oven to 350F (175 C). Use pre-made pie crust or make your own. Grease 9-inch (23 cm) pie dish, unless the crust comes in a foil pie dish.Press crust into pie dish evenly, then put in fridge while preparing filling.\n\nSaute onions, pepper, and bacon in olive oil on medium-high heat. Once cooked through, add in spinach until wilted. Turn off heat and let cool.\n\nIn a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, 1/2 cup cheese, salt and pepper. Add in bacon mixture and pour into crust. Sprinkle the remaining cheese on top and bake for 35-40 minutes or until no longer jiggly. A knife inserted into the center should come out clean.

So the way I was always taught to do it was to remove the previous component from the pan between each step. That way you can control the exactly amount of heat each of these things get. \n\nObviously a lot of this depends on what exactly you‚Äôre trying to make - but suppose it‚Äôs a typical stew (the same would apply to other stew like things like bolognese and certain meat based sauces) - you‚Äôd start of with searing your meat until you develop some fond, which also serves as an indicator of a good Maillard reaction. Take out the pieces of meat and replace them with the mirepoix and add salt to draw out the moisture, while using some of that moisture to deglaze out some of that fond built up in that previous step. Take out the mirepoix and add in the mushrooms, salt and mix with butter until they get small, and then add back everything in. \n\nThe order doesn‚Äôt really matter too much if you‚Äôre doing each component separately. But if you‚Äôre not I can kind of imagine that you always want to be doing meat first before adding in the mirepoix. The moisture from the mirepoix will typically prevent you from getting temperatures high enough to get a good sear (read develop fond and a Maillard reaction) on the meat.",

Then replace the amount you took out by adding more stock, more beef/beens etc. But if you try to dilute a whole pot, it's harder because it takes more new ingredients. You could always add back the chili you took out bit by bit to a tolerable spice point.",

I think the safest bet is to boil the chicken to avoid any oil or butter making their stomachs even more upset. You can just boil a chicken breast (or thigh) and then shred it up so you have enough to last a few more meals if needed. Also, our vets used to recommend pumpkin puree to aid their digestion. If you decide to use that, make sure it has absolutely no added sugar or spices or any additives in general. I‚Äôd mix some of it into the chicken and rice and the dogs loved it!

Parsley stems always go in that bag, since parsley only grows for half the year or less here. Sometimes there are scraps from peppers and such but I try to keep it pretty consistent. Anything else goes into compost.\n\nIf I need more veggies I can grab leeks or perpetual spinach from my garden (or other things but those are always in abundance).\n\nFresh herbs will again be whatever I have on hand. I always have oregano and sometimes have thyme so those and the parsley are good enough. I also add a lot of whole peppercorns.\n\nThen I roast some chicken bones (or turkey or beef or whatever but it is usually chicken) and add all the veggies to a big \"soup sock\" and put everything in the pot, cover it in water, bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer and let it go overnight (minimum 10 hours). In the morning I turn off the heat and once it is cool enough to not burn me, portion it out.\n\nStock made at home is way better than storebought but I would also like it to be cheap/free, not spend a bunch of money on ingredients. At most I will buy some parsley.",

I grate the cheddar myself, because the shredded stuff in the dairy case has anti-caking agents added that make the sauce break.  The medium cheddar is less likely to break the sauce (less oily) than sharp and the American cheese has an additive that makes the sauce smooth.  None of that stuck to the plastic American cheese-ish stuff.  The real thing from a deli.  Just tear it into bits.\n\nAdd your cheese slowly, stirring constantly, to a simple white sauce that's been removed from the heat after thickening.\n\nI like the large elbow macaroni (or penne if you can't find that). The pasta will be less likely to get mushy if it has some backbone to start with.  Cook about 3/4 of the time on the package in boiling salted water, add it to the sauce, then finish it off by baking.  There's nothing like the lovely cheese crust on that browned top and edges.\n\nSpices are black pepper, dry mustard powder and a bit of cayenne (literally less than you think you'll be able to taste, just to add depth of flavor but no real heat).  Taste and salt if needed, but remember the cheese is salty and will get saltier as the sauce cooks down, so be careful.",

I would just add on that no matter what quality past you use, adding fresh ginger, garlic, shallot, and chilies is always my recommendation. Also using a cooking peanut butter such as valencia gives a more straightforward peanut flavor which makes a difference.\n\nWhile it‚Äôs hard to say w/out knowing your process, there‚Äôs a number of steps that could potentially be improved. For one, make sure you salt the veggies once they‚Äôre fully sweating! Also, I know in some locations it can be hard to get quality curry paste! Plus when you do, it can be hard to use all of it up if you‚Äôre not making curry regularly. Using it as a rub for roasted veggies is delicious and reduces paste waste. *Maybe most importantly*, add a good bit more salt than you might think you need before you add the chicken. The curry needs to be more flavorful than you might think since it is responsible for seasoning both the chicken and the rice you‚Äôre probably serving it with.",

        "body": "Great notes from everyone here, but I want to add some philosophy behind cooking thai food.\n\nIn thai cooking you're wanting to get a good balance of a lot of different flavors: Sweet, salty, sour, spicy. On top of that, you've got aromatics. There's a pretty solid traditional ingredients list representing these flavors that holds true for a lot of thai food.\n\nSweet: palm sugar, coconut\n\nSpicy: Thai chili, curry paste (which is just ground up chili with aromatics)\n\nSalty/Umami: fish sauce, dried shrimp, oyster sauce\n\nSour: lime juice, tamarind \n\nAromatics: shallot, onion, garlic, lemongrass, cilantro, ginger, basil, chives, lime leaf (good curry paste basically has all of these)\n\nIf you can balance some combination of these base flavor ingredients cooked with veggies or protein, then throw some aromatics at it, you've got a pretty solid start on a more traditional thai dish than what you're making, with the flavor boost that goes with it.\n\nSo once you've eliminated the not so great ingredients and gotten some higher quality ones to work with like suggested elsewhere, think about how to incorporate these flavors in balance with each other, and if you're missing an element, reach for one of those options listed for the best results. For instance, your recipe doesn't have anything sour in it, so just by adding some lime juice you'll kick it up significantly, even before you ditch the non traditional ingredients.\n\nGood luck! Thai food is super rewarding to cook because of how simple and delicious it is.",

        "body": "Most important thing is to get better curry paste. I love Mae Ploy, but just go to an asian market instead of a supermarket to buy it, they should all be good.\n\n  \nSecond part is that you're starting off wrong. For basically all thai curries:\n\n\\- Add about 1/4 of the coconut milk to a pan and gently simmer until the coconut oil and milk fats separate. (This is what you want, but it depends on if the milk has added stabilizers and stuff if it will actually separate. Just simmer it for a couple minutes, if it doesn't split I add a tiny bit of neutral oil)\n\n\\- Fry the curry paste in the oil/milk, those ingredients are raw and need some love.\n\n\\- Fry your chicken or other protein in this mixture. (for a better result, use boneless chicken legs/thighs/anything but breast. Breast overcooks easily and you mostly wanna use it in situations where you can quickly remove it from the heat, not very good for a soupy curry)\n\n\\- Add the rest of the coconut milk/the bamboo shoots/peanut butter/some broth and simmer for 15 mins (simmer depending on the cooking time of your protein of choise). \n\n  \nGarlic/onion/pepper really shouldn't be needed if you get better curry paste. Peanut butter I've never tried but if you like it you do you. You need some sugar though, usually that's palm sugar.\n\n  \nIf you realy want to level it up, during the last step, add some makrut lime leaves (easy to find in asian supermarket, and can go in the freezer), and fish sauce¬†(can be substituted by soy sauce/maggi seasoning/worcestershire saus, but fish sauce¬†realy is worth buying). Then after taking it off the stove, add an almost ungodly amount of thai basil (also easy to find in asian supermarket)\n\n  \nNow, if you want all this rambling in the form of an actual readable recipe, here is a very good one [(hot thai kitchen)](https://hot-thai-kitchen.com/quick-red-curry-chicken/).

Drain and it's ready to use then and there or put in the freezer for later use. I generally do this so I can have stock/broth in the freezer for when I need it  \n  \n However, I can add to that depending on what I want to add to the dish I will be using the stock/broth for. The more complex I go, it is pretty much a given than I am going complex for specific reasons. Such adding certain vegetables, if I roast/cook them first or whatever else.",

You could do the quick pickling or refrigerator method but idk if that would give you the flavor you're looking for.\n\n\nWhen I'm making beets at home, I roast them in the oven, dump them in an ice water bath, and pull the skins off. When I'm ready to serve, I dress them with a sweet vinaigrette. Usually oil, vinegar, honey, and a spoonful of whatever suitable fruit preserve or jelly I have on hand.

I recommend using the butter brand MELT. No dairy in it, but acts more or less like real butter. Tastes fine. Only reason we stopped using that is because we found a real dairy butter that has no lactose in it. I've used melt in cooking and baking and just as butter on toast.",

You can freeze them with a marinade as well, then just plop into a pan or oven dish! There are a lot of ‚Äúfreezer dump meals‚Äù that seem nice as well, but I don‚Äôt have so much space in mine so I just freeze meats to make them last longer. \n\nFor fish, primarily I mostly just eat salmon so I‚Äôll usually take it out of its package and check thoroughly for any bones. If I am able to buy a large side of it, I‚Äôll then portion it into fillets. \n\nMy other recent favorite is COOKED RICE!!!!! Every time I make rice in the cooker I‚Äôll make an extra 2-3 cups. Then after dinner when the rice has cooled down I‚Äôll portion it into small size ziplocs so that a bag has approximately a single serving of rice in it. To reheat from frozen I just put it in a bowl and sprinkle about a tablespoon of water on top, then cover with a damp paper towel or microwave safe parchment paper. Doesn‚Äôt take more than a few minutes and tastes very similar to fresh. This is also helpful because cooling the starch leads to a less sharp blood sugar peak after eating. :) I really like it when I need to make something quick and I can either saut√© some veggies or throw a salmon or chicken fillet in the oven or pan to have a meal ready in 15 mins or less.\n\nI also see a lot of videos of people freezing fresh chopped garlic in ice cube trays or ziplocs with a grid pressed into it by chopsticks or the back of a knife, so it creates breakable points  :)",

After breaking the mix up and frying just until done, let it cool a bit and divide up into 4 quart-sized freezer bags. Lay flat and refrigerate until cold (to prevent ice crystals), then freeze. Use in chili, tacos, Sloppy Joes, meat sauce, etc. \n\nI also batch freeze chicken cutlets (or chicken tenders). Use your favorite breading mix but, for me, the trick is to then add a drizzle of olive oil to the bread crumb mix so it's kind of like moist (not wet) sand. After breading, place on a tray in the freezer and after the cutlets are frozen, place in a freezer bag or container separating the cutlets with wax paper or parchment. When ready to eat, throw them in the oven or air fryer and the olive oil on the breading will keep them from tasting \"dry\". Great for quick chicken Parm! \n\nAny time you have leftover vegetables, save them in a freezer bag and, combined with your pre-prepped carrots, celery, onions, you've got extra flavor for veggie soup. Also save and freeze Parm and Romano rinds to toss into soups and sauces.\n\nAdded: use the pre-prepped carrots, onions, celery for a quick stuffing/dressing for roast chicken or turkey. Keep bags of stuffing croutons in the freezer.\n\nAnd keep plenty of low-salt/no-salt-added bone broth or stock on hand for soups, gravies, and sauces.

It will be sort of hard the next day, but this is what you want. Also wash your rice before you cook it, as in fill the bowl with water, swish around for a bit until cloudy, drain, repeat a few times until it‚Äôs clear-ish.\n\nFind a high smoke point oil, like peanut or avocado and a high quality silicone wok spatula. The metal one I tried scratched my seasoning up, and will ruin non stick coating. \n\nIf it‚Äôs carbon steel, let it heat up until it starts to smoke a bit, add oil and let it heat some, swirl it around so it coats the main cooking surface. When it‚Äôs cooled and you‚Äôre ready to clean it, either scrub it with hot water or you can use a bit of mild dish soap. They also make chain mail scrubbers to get the caked on burnt stuff off. Dry it after rinsing, heat it back up and add a drizzle of oil and wipe it around with a paper towel to coat the whole surface and let it cook on a bit. Just enough to make it shine.\n\nLook up how to velvet meat, which cuts of chicken and beef to use, and freeze for 20 mins before slicing against the grain. \n\nSmaller pieces of vegetables will cook faster, larger stuff may need to be parboiled before, or it will take forever to cook in the wok and can get burnt. \n\nI tend to cook in bulk, but I‚Äôll do it in batches. First I‚Äôll chop all my meats and veggies up and have them laid out in piles on my cutting board. I‚Äôll toss each one in separately so I can get the texture I want on each one, maybe with a little salt. I‚Äôll remove them before they‚Äôre tender enough and dump into a stainless bowl because they will steam and soften there. Once it‚Äôs all done, I‚Äôll pour my sauce in, heat it until simmering, add cornstarch slurry and stir quickly. Once it thickens I‚Äôll pour the bowl of goods in and mix it up, then add things like cilantro or Thai basil. Turn the heat and mix around until herbs are softened.",

I made this square, which has this in common with what I want to do for a different square, so I'll adapt here and there...\n\nCooking works much the same, I've found.\n\nI second recommendations of *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.* I got the book for Christmas and found you can immediately apply some of what the author talks about. As soon as I read the salt portion, I started doing some of what she described -- salting meat before cooking, veggies too, and using more salt when I make pasta. It's a fun when you can do that, it doesn't feel like you're just plodding along with a text book. Haven't seen the Netflix series yet.\n\nI've also recently started watching Good Eats, the Alton Brown series. For me in the US, it's on Max. It's great. It's like science without the science, in some ways. He gives you the science behind things, but you don't need chemical formulae for it, and more importantly, he gives you the why, the applications. (I'm very much an application person, not a theory person, as I learned in college math :p). I highly recommend it. \n\nGood luck!",

Learn to roast a whole chicken. Most importantly, learn how to not overcook the chicken breast. You should be pulling the chicken from the oven when the breast is no more than 140¬∞f.  Read up on why this is safe, as long as you rest the chicken for long enough. Pasteurization is a function of temperature *and* time.\n\n2. Use the carcass and leftover bones to make a homemade chicken stock. \n\n3. Use the stock to make a demi-glace. A real one, with reduction and *reinforcement*.\n\nDuring the cold months, I roast a chicken at least once a week, specifically so that I can build up a stockpile of ... well ... *stock*.\n\nHaving homemade chicken stock on hand will, by itself, elevate so much of your cooking. It makes all your braises better. It improves your rice. It improves your beans. It's great for polenta. It's great for pan sauces of all kinds.\n\nGetting into the habit of making stock also teaches you the most important skill you can have in the kitchen: patience.\n\nIt's a massive hurdle to get over: routinely doing prep work that will pay dividends in the future.",

        "body": "I took a one-day cooking class when I was in Rome, and one of the things we made was gnocchi.\n\nThe chef had a mixing bowl with several cups of salt in it. He asked, how much salt should I put in the water when we boil the potatoes? We gave our best guesses--a tablespoon? A handful?\n\nThen he theatrically dumped the whole bowl into the pot of water. Gasp!\n\nHe went on to explain that gnocchi should be as potato-forward as possible, with only just enough flour added to make it into a workable dough. The more water in the potato, the more flour needs to be added--and the denser the gnocchi is. Apparently a dense gnocchi--truthfully the only kind I'd ever had--is not the Roman way, at least according to this one guy. So the super-salty water forces the water out of the potato as it cooks. Drier potatoes = less flour needed = more potato-y--and less dense--gnocchi.\n\nHe boiled the potatoes in the super-salty water, and when they came out, the skins had salt crystals on them. He peeled and crushed the potatoes so that the remaining steam could escape them, and proceeded with the recipe.\n\nWouldn't you know it? The most tender, daintiest, most pillowy gnocchi I've ever had. (And he baked the salty skins for us to snack on, too--delicious!) I've been ruined!\n\n**ETA:** the recipe was emailed to us, but truthfully it's a little difficult to decode. Sharing verbatim below:\n\n>Gnocchi dough: 360 gramms of salt per liter of water,start cold. Ones the potatoes are ready ¬†you mash the ¬†potatoes when hot. Let the potatoes cool down then ¬†add 1/4 of flower of them weight ¬†+ 1 yolk, seasoning and work quickly.¬† REMEMBER :Mash the potatoes when hot, add the flour and work the dough when cold\n\n**Based on the above, my memory, and best guesses, here is my translation:** in a pot, add 360g of salt per liter of water (so a whole 26oz/737g box of Diamond Kosher Salt would go in 2L of water), plus potatoes (skin on). Start from cold and bring to a boil; cook until potatoes are fork tender. Drain the potatoes and de-skin/mash right away, allowing the steam to escape. Set aside to cool completely.\n\nOnce the potatoes are cool, add AP flour and one egg yolk (I would assume that the egg yolk scales up with the recipe, but I am not sure how many pounds of potatoes this recipe assumes-~~perhaps one yolk per 5lbs of potatoes? But I truthfully don't remember~~ [this recipe](https://anitalianinmykitchen.com/gnocchi/) has similar proportions and calls for 1 egg yolk per 1 pound of potatoes. Who knows? Use your judgement). The amount of flour added will be equivalent to 1/4 the amount of potatoes by weight, or 1/4 lb of flour for every 1 lb of potatoes. Work it quickly into a dough, conservatively adding more flour if the dough is very sticky. Working in batches, roll the dough into a cylinder approximately 1/2\"-3/4\" wide, then cut into bite-sized pieces. Boil the gnocchi pieces in boiling water for a few minutes or until they float.",

Boiling tofu in salted water  (or even unsalted, but less so) dries it out.  A lot more than pressing and draining. Just pretend you boiled a steak and you'll understand why. Good for crispy tofu dishes.\n\nPS. Frozen then thawed firm tofu has an amazing texture!

Maybe something as simple as porkbelly and onions with a pepper paste based sauce alongside some lettuce to eat it with. Might not be what you consider classy though. \n\nIf you are reconsidering the main course, shrimp is a really great way to have a simple but appealing appetizer. I really like coconut curry (so some kind of Thai curry, whatever you like) shrimp skewers. Doesn't *sound* classy but shrimp skewers are really easy to plate in a way that looks good when you use the smeared sauce plating. Very neat looking awhile still being a way to dip. The shrimp themselves should be coated only very lightly, and you use the sauce on the plate if you want more. Obviously still a bit on the \"finger food\" side of things though.\n\nThey can feel complicated to get into, but cooked Maki can be an excellent option and really aren't that hard to make. Don't be afraid to put 'regular' meat in sushi just because it isn't as normal as fish. Obviously shrimp tempora works too.",

Look for a brand with crystal clear cubes.\n\nA beautifully presented shrimp cocktail on cracked ice with lemon wedges and a bespoke cocktail sauce made of cocktail sauce and horseradish or horseradish sauce. (both jarred from the store.).  One way to do this even easier is to see if you can find the fiery  ‚ÄúSt Elmo‚Äôs Steakhouse Shrimp Cocktail Sauce‚Äù and mix it with Kraft or some other same-o, same-o brand.\n\nGrilled or broiled filet mignon **au beurre**, seasoned well!, and if you can take the extra fat, put a scant 1 tsp pat of butter on each at serving time. A vegetable peeler comes in handy for this make sure the butter is not right out of the fridge, tho. You can also make a compound butter, but then it‚Äôs usually more like 1 tbsp., so cut each ball in half. \n\nRoasted vegetable of the season with orange zest, naturally I‚Äôm thinking asparagus, but this works for fresh detailed green beans or other.  One veggie only, not mixed vegetables. I like the long shape of green beans and asparagus.  Roast them hot with 2 tsp. melted butter and the zest of one super clean &/organic orange. S&P.\n\nYou can add some - two or three only - of those baby potatoes that come in the bag, microwave them for 1 1/2 minutes, brush with combo butter/olive oil and stick them on the same sheet pan as the vegetables at the same time. I use a toaster convection oven, but you may have an air fryer?\n\nDessert: Classic Peach Melba. Sounds good, easy to make. Fresh Peaches are in season here, not sure there. Use a recipe or the easy way - Raspberry pur√©e from Penzey‚Äôs, or Trader Joe‚Äôs or Smucker‚Äôs Raspberry Simply Fruit, and if it‚Äôs not sweet enough, melt it down and add sugar. The presentation is the thing. It‚Äôs usually served in a champagne coupe. (Find them at Goodwill - you don‚Äôt need crystal ala Cary Grant.)\n\nFor cocktails, look up the recipe for Tom Collins or Vodka Collins and serve in a tall skinny glass.",

It's natural to want it to feel special and thoughtful.\n\nAppetizer: Pan-seared scallops with some lemon butter sauce and crispy prosciutto\n\n* Scallops feel luxurious and cooks quickly and since your partner likes shrimp I feel that scallops are a good step-up to make it feel more luxurious. The crispy and salty prosciutto complements the soft scallops too.\n\nMains:  Pan-seared filet mignon, roasted asparagus with some parmesan\n\n* Filet mignon is very tender and it also feels like a special occasion ingredient. You can also use red wine to reduce it.\n* You can use the same pan for both the scallops and the filet mignon. I feel that its a great way to build layers of flavor, especially when making a pan sauce for the filet. It also saves you on cleanup and cooking time as you are not waiting for multiple pans to heat up and fewer pans to wash.\n\nDesert: Poached pears\n\n* I think the flavor of pears works well with scallops and the fillet migon, especially when poached. You can also use the same red wine from above to reduce the pears.\n\nHope this helps and the anniversary dinner goes well! Don't forget to set the mood and ambience, but this is about celebrating your anniversary and love so have fun with it!!",

It's tangy, hot, spicy, and blows your socks off. Once you've got that, you've got it made, all you need to add is some crunch and some freshness. So my ideas...\n* Go absolute hangover special with generously buttered round bread rolls (real butter, good rolls), crisps, and garlic pickle. It has zero pretensions to class and will create a new eternal craving. Whatever he makes, this is competing on a completely different playing field. \n* Go stylish with juicy tender slices of chicken breast and shredded heart of romaine lettuce (or anything similarly crunchy but with flavour, so no iceberg lettuce), with a seeded bread. Again butter the bread. (Everyone in the UK and India butters bread for sandwiches, so I'm just going to take that as read now.)\n* Go street food trad with a thin omelette, folded to fit in the roll, the garlic pickle, and fresh coriander OR [coriander chutney](https://meerasodha.com/recipes/coriander-chutney-3/) (you just blitz up the ingredients) and sev for crunch.",

Hollow the loaf out a bit so you have a bread bowl with a bit of bread still on the bottom for structural integrity. Rub the inside and top with a little olive oil and rub it with some cloves of garlic. Then you do layers of ham, roasted red pepper, thin sliced onion, thin sliced tomato, olive tapenade, thin sliced fresh mozzarella, and whole basil leaves- youll have 2-3 layers of each depending on how big your loaf is. Give the top a generous bit of cracked black pepper, then put the loaf top back on, wrap it in plastic wrap, and set it in the fridge with something wide and heavy on it and leave overnight. I use my Dutch oven filled with canned goods.\n\n\nNext day you'll have a beautiful pressed sandwich with all those flavors melted together thats soft and moist and stays together well.

        "body": "I've been in this exact scenario. I brought a camping BBQ and my cast iron griddle plate to do all my cooking. Night 1 was tacos. I pre-marinated the chicken thighs in chipotles, lime, tequila, cilantro and pre-cut the onions, cilantro, etc, and pre-made the guacamole and mango salsa, and brought a couple hunks of queso fresco to crumble on top.\n\nNight 2 was steaks and potato salad. I cooked the steaks sous vide and brought them vac sealed. Just had to sear them. Potato salad was store bought.\n\nNight 3 was pork tenderloin (again, sous vide and transported in the vac bag, just sear it and cut it), with udon noodles that I cooked in a cast iron pan, with cabbage and onions I had prepped. The sauce was just a reduction of the juices from the pork, and I brought a little jar of sesame seeds and some green onions for garnish. \n\nNight 4 was chicken wings, salad, and chips. I dry rubbed the wings in a few flavours and brought them (you guessed it) vacuum sealed. \n\nFor breakfasts I went with sausages instead of bacon because the amount of bacon grease produced would have overflowed my plate and started a grease fire. Eggs were scrambled in a pot on the BBQ a la Gordon Ramsey, and I brought focaccia to char on the griddle. \n\nOn the day that we were leaving, for breakfast I just made individual charcuterie plates so we didn't have to do dishes and deal with cooking. Nothing too fancy. Just a few kinds of meat like salami, some Montreal smoked meat I had in the freezer, I even think pepperoni sticks were involved, some smoked salmon, some brie and manchego that I just tore apart by hand, some nuts, Raincoast Crisps (praise them), some berries, dates, cherry tomatoes, and a scoop of jam right in the fuckin middle. That was everyone's favourite breakfast.\n\nBring lots of water and paper towel. I would also recommend a box of nitrile gloves so that you can just wear them to handle the food and change them, instead of constantly trying to wash your hands. Instant coffee is good enough. And don't forget the salt and pepper, chef.",

        "body": "Cooking within a typical camping fire pit is a pain. The built in grill is usually too far from the fire and its nasty. The only fire cooking I do camping is usually a dessert in a dutch oven. I typically take coals out of the fire ring and arrange on the ground, then set the dutch oven on those, then add more to the top of the lid.\n\nConsider bringing a large propane fired flattop grill, like a Blackstone. Much easier to cook a volume of food on quickly.\n\nI like to cook one-pot meals such as jambalaya or chili. It makes the logistics of cooking, serving and cleanup much easier when camping. Drunk people have an easier time sitting in a camp chair with one bowl than a plate of steak and asparagus.\n\nBreakfast tacos every morning. I also like those hash brown potatoes that are freeze dried and in a little milk carton container.\n\nMy other trick in camp kitchens is that I bring 3 bussing tubs from the restaurant supply store. That's for cleanup. Everyone wipes their one bowl and spoon such that it looks almost clean. Throw into bus tub. After that do hot water and soap in one, bleach+water in the next tub and then a plain hot rinse water.\n\nIf you make a dish that needs chopped onion, celery and whatever. Chop that at home and bag it and store for the trip in the ice chest. Again, drunk people with knives can be bad.\n\nBring two ice chests: one with food only, the other with drinks only. This keeps the drunks from letting the cold out of your food ice chest.",

Bring a cast iron pan to cook up some mushrooms or to make a pan sauce. Bring lots of garlic, butter and seasoning salt for those mushrooms. Red wine reduction with butter makes a great pan sauce. Bring a instant read thermometer too. Fire temperature isn't as controlled on an open pit as it would be at home over a fire, some extra feedback is useful or you may overcook your beautiful steaks. \n\nOne of my favorite meals in this situation is a big premade salad and something simple like sausages or garlic coil over the fire. \n\nCorn on the cob roasted over the fire is amazing. Make it a bit more over the top by bringing fixings to make Mexican street corn. \n\nBaked potatoes in tin foil is always good. Bring bacon for making bacon bits and lots of sour cream and green onions. \n\nIf you want seafood a seafood boil would be fun. Bring a big pot, potatoes, corn, sausage and all of the seafood you want. Lots of bay seasoning. Put out a big disposable table cloth and get messy on a picnic table. \n\nI always default to bush pies. Bring the bush pie maker and in advance make up a big tub with pepperoni, cheese, onions, peppers, tomato paste , etc. Bread, butter, filling, cook and serve. \n\nOne of our camping traditions is to make curry. We do beef vindaloo. Big pot over the fire and a dedicated watch man to make sure it doesn't burn. Hopefully the watch man doesn't get too drunk lol. \n\nIt's also fire ban season. Make sure to have a backup camp stove so you don't have to eat everything cold. \n\nI could go on for days lol.",

        "body": "Boneless chicken breast in the skillet - either whole, sliced, or cubed. Cook in butter or olive oil. Salt and pepper the chicken, or add other seasonings if you want, like garlic or onion powder. If you cook whole, wait until the sides of the chicken turn white and then flip. You can marinate the chicken with store bought or homemade marinade first, too. WASH YOUR HANDS. Serve with pasta or rice. Buy some jarred sauces that sound fun.  \n\nTacos. Buy an Old El Paso taco kit, and a pound of ground beef. Also buy shredded cheddar cheese. Put the ground beef in the skillet and cook it - medium or low heat, not too high - and use a spatula to turn it. When it‚Äôs no longer pink, follow the instructions on the packet. \n\nItalian sausage in the skillet - I think the easiest way to cook Italian sausage, if not on the grill, is to take it out of its casing. Take a knife and gently slice the side, and remove the casing.  Put in skillet on medium heat. Use a spatula to break it up. Now you have Italian sausage crumbles. Serve with pasta and red sauce. \n\nChili: There are hundreds of chili recipes if not thousands. Start simple. I don‚Äôt put beans in my chili. But ground beef, tomato juice, mccormicks chili seasoning. Cook the beef in a skillet and drain it and add it to that tomato juice and seasoning. But again, so many recipes and most are pretty simple. \n\nPotato soup. \nCube a bunch of potatoes and then add them to chicken broth. Enough that covers the potatoes. Or use water and add a chicken bouillon cube or two. Add celery seed, onion powder, and once the potatoes are almost done, add milk and more American cheese than you think you‚Äôll need. Like one slice per potato!  \n\nPasta\nPasta with jarred red sauce, jarred Alfredo, or just pasta with butter salt and pepper. If you do pasta with jarred sauce, warn the sauce separately. Add spices as needed.  There are also so many pasta salad recipes. Ideally, protein, cheese, dressing, pasta, herbs. Parmesan cheese as a topping. \n\nPasta with meat sauce \nGround beef, pasta of your choice, red sauce \nCook the ground beef in a pan, cook the pasta in a pot, warm the red sauce in a pan. Drain the pasta, I like to drain the beef as well but I think some people don‚Äôt do that, and put the pasta and beef into the red sauce pan and gently stir. \n\nPork tenderloin \nBuy a pork tenderloin, a few cans of cream of celery or cream of mushroom, red potatoes, can of green beans, carrots if you want, etc. If you don‚Äôt have a casserole dish, you need that too haha! Throw it all in there, put it in the oven at 350 or 400, and start a movie. Look up some recipes for exact times depending on the weight of the pork. Dinner will be ready before the movie is over. \n\nOne last note - I say pasta instead of a specific type of pasta. I think as a beginner, penne or rotini is easier than linguine or spaghetti. I‚Äôm 42 and when I make something with linguine I‚Äôm like ugh compared to penne or rotini haha.",

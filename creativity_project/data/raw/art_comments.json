This looks like a circa 1900 Elgin open face pocket watch (roman numerals were in fashion from the 1870-1900 or so). I think this one is closer to 1900 because it looks to be a size 16s with a winding crown instead of the older size 18s with a lever/key set.  Finding new OEM parts can be difficult for these, but there were millions made so finding a donor movement is usually pretty easy unless it's a special/unique model.  I love this artwork!",

It's design allowed the wearer to fluctuate between high and low energy-phases. Its first experiment required the cooperation of four gravital mages. They would create an orbital fall. A technique of gravity manipulation that bent space-time. The armor enabled stasis within this sphere of magic.\n\nLon was a former 'Running Flame'. A tribe which never participated in the experimentation of their native conduction art. This caused emotional tension within himself and the participants. It took several years for the project to start. Trepidation stirred among the team, as the tribe made every effort to slow progress.\n\nIt took six years before the experiment could run. The process began by creating a dark void. A point in space absent of energy. Four mages then focused on the point with a gravity well. Further condensing the 4-dimensional point to collapse. Once it reached mass compression, space-time ripped. This caused an eruption of high-energy. The five observed a black-sphere no bigger than a mulden-berry hover within the well. The wobbling dot became a photon before their eyes. Colors never seen before burst from its position.\n\nThe experiment was a success, introducing a new study on the nature of conduction. Several years later the mages disappeared. Fame and a life of notoriety consumed their waking moments. They could no longer concentrate on the things that mattered. But these factors were not the root cause of their recession from public life.\n\nDecades passed and the memory of the famous five faded from the minds of everyone. A dilapidated structure left in their place. An eerie visage held where light had been thrust without consent into the world. One day a young mage encountered the site of the experiment. The mages had not moved. She notes,\n\n‚ÄúThey floated in place, like weightless statues made of pure light. I approached the central figure's body and reached out to touch it. My hand passed through. Light flickered against my skin. It was an odd sensation as if I could feel someone saying 'hello'. I felt cold and not within this realm for a brief moment.‚Äù\n\nIt took several years before the bodies of light disappeared. Studies determined they had converted to a hybrid of photons and essentia over a period of time. Their essence lost to the ethereal plane. The practice of conducting light was forbidden for generations.\n\nB.S.M. 15345, Spectra Archive #983",

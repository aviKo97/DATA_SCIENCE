Would have guessed he was a lawyer, if he was sitting ahead of the bar.\n\nHe stands up, and says out loud, \"Well, I have a driver's liscence with that name on it, but as its in capitals you can see that's the name of a corporation, your honour.\"\n\nThe justice on the bench did his best to be reasonable with this guy. But the guy immeadiatly starts a speech about how the system is corrupt and there needs to be changes. \nHe would go on about that several times in the next while.\n\nThis first time, the justice says, \"That's not what we are here to discuss today. We're here for a speeding ticket. And if *defendant's name* doesn't present himself in front of this bar, I'm ruling a conviction in absense.\"\n\nSo the defendant hustles in front of the bar (officially presenting himself for the case, behind the bar is gallery only) and proceeds to start an indignant series of acid born arguements that were so bizzare as to verge on schitzophrenia.\n\nHighlights were: \n\nTrying to invoke papal law. To which the justice responds, \"Papal law? This isn't rome, that doesn't apply here.\"\n\nDefendant tries to quote admiralty law, which perplexes the justice as, \"Where do you get admiralty law? This is Alberta, this is the most landlocked province in the country. Where do you get admiralty law?\"\nThe defendant replies, straight faced and serious, \"Well there used to be a fountain in the basement, sir.\"\n\nMind you, defendant hasn't even made his initial plea yet. Multiple times the justice tries to steer him back on track, and the guy keeps responding, \"Well, I did it, but that's not the point.\"\n\nSo well after a balif has been called to keep an eye on this thing, and I, witnessing this, have finally realized I wasn't dreaming, the justice on the bench finally says, \"Ok. Fine, you've said you've done it multiple times before, and I'll accept that as a guilty plea.\"  Hands out fine and thirty days to pay, next case.",

During SARS Toronto was locked down and air travel in/out was almost completely banned. We had a tech who lived in downtown Toronto. Instead of recognizing the seriousness of the situation, the company had this guy drive to another city (usually Ottawa), and fly out of there to bypass the flying ban.\n\nJust before swine flu really hit the news, *something* swept through our office. People were really fucking sick. Our travelling technicians were all forced out onto planes and into respiratory care wings of hospitals across the continent. Anyone who complained was told to shut up and do their jobs. Swine flu made several rounds through the office, and these guys were always traveling while sick.\n\nSo yeah, my company helped spread two nasty viruses directly to hospital departments loaded with people who were by definition very vulnerable to the effects of said viruses.",

After what seemed like only a little time passed, I looked back to shore and realized I was very far out.  I started swimming back but no matter how hard I swam, I was not getting any closer.  I soon started tiring and finally started yelling for help.  Fortunately, we had a Romanian college student staying with us, who also came on vacation with my family.  She heard me, swam out, and pushed me back into shore.  I then learned that I'd been stuck in a rip tide.    \n  \nRip tides are no joke and anyone swimming in the ocean should know about them.",

        "body": "10 years ago I picked up a random chest infection that started off as a bad cough but developed into a post nasal drip.  This meant my sinuses would regularly drip mucus down the back of my throat, into my lungs.\n\n  \nWhile the goop was in my lungs it would dry out a little and eventually I'd cough it up but it would have the consistency of glue and it would immediately block my throat causing me to choke.    I would then have to retch, hoping to clear my throat before I choked to death.  It could take a couple minutes to clear my throat, all the while I didn't know if I'd survive as my vision started to dim and I slowly lost consciousness.   This was happening every few hours for a week.\n\nBut the absolute worse part was that it would happen while I was asleep.  I'd just suddenly wake up, already choking and with my lungs only partially filled with air so I could never be sure my body would have enough air pressure to clear my throat.   I was so afraid of it happening that I went without sleep for 3 days but it got to the point I knew I could no longer keep myself awake.  \n\nI lived alone and there was no one nearby that could look after me.  So I put out extra helpings of cat food and water out because I knew it'd be a few days before someone discovered my body.\n\nI drifted off to sleep knowing that I'd soon wake up again with a blocked throat.   \n\nLuckily I was able to eventually fight off the infection and the drip stopped.  Worse thing that ever happened to me.",

I feel a sense of clarity in my thoughts, as if I‚Äôve taken back my brain space. No home internet is annoying at times, but I grew up on dial-up, so I don‚Äôt mind waiting a little longer for content to load. I finally caved this week and got a subscription to Hulu just so I could watch some shows on my phone (or tv with hotspot when it‚Äôs working). I was so tired of the 4 basic channels I get from the antenna and old DVDs. I hate the idea of ‚Äúrenting‚Äù entertainment, but I felt so isolated and disconnected.

She grew up on a farm with no electricity or running water and didn't get these amazing luxuries until she was a teenager.  Technology to her has always been some kind of black magic I think.\n\nExamples:\n\n\\* First time she used a mouse, picked it up and tried to wave it around to make it work\n\n\\* I remoted into their laptop once to fix it.  She asked if the post-it note on the screen was bothering me.  I was 4,500 miles away at the time.  I told her nah it's fine.\n\n\\* Bought herself an e-reader.  I spent two afternoons patiently explaining how it worked and the very next day got a phone call asking how to turn it on.  I think she used it once, then went back to traditional books.\n\n\\* Was shown her house on Google Earth.  Told my kids to run outside and wave.\n\n\\* Called me to say there was a bird chirping in the ceiling.  It was the battery for the fire alarm.",

None of us are in it for the money, so if we also aren‚Äôt there for the personal fulfillment anymore I don‚Äôt know how long the health insurance will really keep us in the profession. \n\nMany districts are facing continuously declining enrollment. That means less money each year, so everything gets a little (or a lot) shittier. Unless there‚Äôs a total overhaul of how we fund schools, this is a death spiral. School buildings are crumbling and overcrowded. \n\nThe kids are not okay. COVID broke the world and while I guess a lot of adults can overlook that it‚Äôs glaringly obvious in a school setting. I don‚Äôt blame kids or families‚Äî it‚Äôs deeper than that. We have been collectively failed by our government and it is our kids who are suffering. They don‚Äôt know how to function in a community. There‚Äôs an epidemic of mistrust, expertise and reliable information have lost all credibility, and the normalization of AI has eroded any sense that learning is even worthwhile. \n\nOur public schools should be the glowing centers of our communities. We should be proud of how much we spend on education, because it should matter to us that our children are able to do incredible things. We should brag about how beautiful the new middle school is and how every kid has access to the best books and equipment in every classroom. My neighbors should be excited to pay my salary and fund my classroom projects instead of having been convinced that my union exists to steal their taxes. \n\nFree public education is the best idea anyone has ever had. There are a million systems and structures within it that I desperately want to change, but the central concept of allowing every kid in America to learn enough to be able to dream big is fucking beautiful and I‚Äôm not ready to give up on it yet.

        "body": "Home security systems.\n\nI used to install alarm systems. Before we would hardwire everything. Every sensor, and connection to phoneline. Camera systems were also hardwired and recorded locally.\n\nThen people stopped having home phones and burglars would sometimes cut telephone lines before breaking in. So everything went cellular for communication.\n\nOver the years big companies like ADT didn't want to pay for trained and experienced installers and service technicians, so they started installing wireless sensors. Because it takes almost no training or experience to install or repair a system like this. Just plug and play, super quick installations, no wiring to worry about, hardly any liability related to accidents in installations, no drilling or going into attics or crawl spaces. Way more cost effective for them, especially since ADT also owned the manufacturering companies that made the products.\n\nThen people started install wifi cloud based cameras like ring and arlo. That ceased to function if they lost connectivity. Versus hardwired cameras with local DVRs.\n\nEverything got easier and faster and streamlined.\n\nOnly problem is that what this means is the entirety of someone's security is contingent on open air communication of wireless signals.\n\nNow you can go online and buy cheap jammers that will kill: Wifi, 4gLte, and wireless alarm sensors.\n\nBefore you would have to cut phonelines and disable sirens, and take dvrs with you to circumvent a person's security system.\n\nNow in the majority of homes you can just turn on a high powered portable jammer and walk right in. The alarm wont trigger, because the alarm panel can receive signals from the sensors because of the interference. Even if it does, it cant call the police because the cellular signals it sends are being blocked. And wifi cameras wont even leave you with any usable footage.\n\nWorst yet, alot of small buisness are set up this same way. Not all, alot still do hardwired. But every day more and more are being upgraded to wireless equipment, less hardwired systems are being installed.",

        "body": "In high school, we had this substitute teacher who came in once a month for a science class. He was incredibly rude to the students, especially girls. He‚Äôd interrupt them, talk over them, and once even said something like, ‚ÄúYou probably won‚Äôt use this anyway‚Äù when someone asked a question about the lesson. One day, a girl in my class who usually kept to herself brought in a science fair medal she had just won from a regional competition. She showed it to the class after our regular teacher returned and everyone was celebrating her achievement. Turns out she had been selected for an international science program and the school wanted to recognize her publicly. She asked if she could give a short talk about her experience. When she got to the front of the room, she paused, looked straight at the substitute in the back, and said, ‚ÄúThis is for anyone who ever told me I wouldn‚Äôt use this stuff.‚Äù The class erupted and the guy never came back. We heard later that the school dropped him from the sub list. Some lessons don‚Äôt come from books.",

My teacher, who I couldn‚Äôt stand, went over and kicked my dog which of course made me furious, but what could I do, I was just a kid.  One thing about my periods, they were always incredibly painful, and I had permission from my parents to leave school and walk the 6 blocks home if it got to painful which I did taking Kelly with me.  Well even though I had written and verbal permission to do so my teacher was incredibly angry I had left school because he told me I couldn‚Äôt leave, he was known for being a prick.  When my teacher knew my parents would be home from work he came screeching into our driveway, opened his car door, and for the first and only time he‚Äôd ever done it Kelly bit him hard.  My dad didn‚Äôt exactly laugh at my teacher, but you could tell he was amused, after that my teacher was made to apologize for kicking Kelly and for trying to forbid me from walking home.

He got pissy and started demanding documents. Aviation isn't like driving, technically if you don't have something on you you're not supposed to fly but in general you're given some professional grace as long as you produce it later. When he wanted my log book I politely told him that's not required to have but out of curtosy I would email him a copy next week when I'm free. \n\n\nHe started getting beligerant so I told him to go fuck himself, closed the canapoy and headed towards the runway.

Teen drivers have far greater accident rates than any other drivers, including drivers 80+.  And while 80+ year old drivers tend to have accidents that produce injuries at a higher rate than younger drivers (but still not as much as teen drivers), that's entirely because older drivers get injured at higher rates than younger drivers from the same type and severity of accidents - in other words, old people are more fragile and get hurt worse in minor crashes.  And the drivers with the fewest accidents per mile driven are those between 60 and 69.\n\nAnecdotally, everyone knows an older diver who shouldn't be driving, but the fact is roads with twice as many senior citizens and half as many teenagers would be significantly safer than roads with fewer older drivers and more teenage drivers.",

Poverty is one of the most silent killers in the world as nearly all deaths including even heart attacks can at least be partially or even fully blamed on poverty or the sheer stress it brings.

I was really little (two or three), so it must have seemed large to me, but from what I remember it was the majority of the top floor. Something in the chimney had collapsed, and caused it to leak carbon monoxide directly into my room.\n\n\nPersonally, I don't remember this at all, but my parents had told me about it a number of times. Apparently, if it wasn't for how large my room was, as well as the split pipe, I most likely would have died in the few weeks that we wouldn't have moved.\n\n\nI've also remembered a few \"vivid dreams\" from in that room.

I backed out of that one by not turning my back and just slowly backing into the woods. Thankfully she didn‚Äôt make chase as she didn‚Äôt view me as a threat. Same farm, I was told there were three ponds (in Texas they are called tanks) and only two were safe. I was told to never go to the third one. I didn‚Äôt listen, rode my bike through the high grass and a slight trail\nto it to see a pond surrounded by trees with vines hanging all over them. I thought, what a peaceful place to read. Those weren‚Äôt vines, those were water\nMoccasins/aka cotton mouths hanging from those trees. To this day, I don‚Äôt know if it was the heat and they were lazy or if they also didn‚Äôt see me as a threat but when I realized the vines were actually climbing the tree limbs, again, I squatted down and backed away slowly until I was a good ways away from the trees then turned and ran for my bike. Multiple other stories of basically immersing myself in deep, canopied woods in central Texas during the summer, but I somehow remained lucky‚Ä¶.that same farm I was up at 5am collecting eggs, releasing cattle and sheep and then went about my day school or summer.

Many parents, teachers, and even some healthcare providers believe that giving children sugary foods or drinks leads to bursts of uncontrollable energy or wild behavior, but dozens of well-designed scientific studies have repeatedly shown no measurable link between sugar consumption and hyperactivity. A major meta-analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that sugar does not affect the behavior or cognitive performance of children in any consistent way. In fact, when researchers conducted double-blind studies where neither the children nor the parents knew whether the child received sugar or a placebo, parents still rated their children as more hyperactive if they believed they had consumed sugar, revealing that the effect is rooted in expectation rather than biology. This is known as the expectancy effect or confirmation bias. The myth likely persists because sugar is often given in exciting or overstimulating settings like birthday parties or holidays where kids are already more energetic due to the environment, not the food itself. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence disproving the claim, the sugar-hyperactivity myth remains deeply embedded in public belief, driven more by perception and tradition than by fact.",

Meditation helped me leave a toxic relationship and calm down a lot, I fell out with the friend and since it was something she got me into, I sort of stopped doing it I guess out of spite. \n\nI really should get back into meditation. If you don‚Äôt vibe with it now, look into different meditation apps, teachers, videos, ect. Even weird shit you don‚Äôt completely agree with can be helpful. Just remembering to take a moment, breathe, and not worry about the environment you are in is incredibly helpful. \n\nIf it doesn‚Äôt work for you now, don‚Äôt write it off. Try it again in a few weeks, months, or years if you have to. \n\nHope that helps",

I explained why and she said to keep stroking so she could see me cum. As i stroked feverishly she asked what I liked most about women and I said tits.  She grabbed my right hand and put it on her tit and said hurry up and cum before my brother gets back.  She cheered me on and kept saying cum for me.  I unleashed a massive and powerful load and she said she had never seen such a big load before.  She gave me a towel and told me to go to the bathroom and clean up.

My mum told us that the emergency phone operator was begging her to start Cpr, but my mum said \"he's dead!\" she told us that she had gone upstairs to take him some medicine when she found him. Over a year later I told the tale at a first aid course that I was on while we were on the topic of heart attack. I told them my dad was stone cold dead, as my mum had found him later on in the evening but she was being asked to perform cpr. I told my mum later that night about me telling the tale. She turns to me and says \"no, he wasn't cold. The toilet was still filling up, so he'd only just used it\". I couldn't believe it! I've never told my brothers. I didn't say anything to her because she was probably in shock at the time. I wish I never knew, he might have had a chance. I can get to their house in 3 minutes. I only found out later when she called my older brother to ask him to tell myself and my younger brother that dad had passed. I headed around there straight away. There was police and paramedics in the house. After they left, my dad remained there until a private ambulance arrived to collect him an hour or so later. By this time, he was on his back. Blood had pooled on one side of his face where he had been face down originally. He wasn't warm (this is how I'd presume he'd been for hours).",

I was smashed against an infinite cheek, and couldn't breathe.\n\nI woke up face down against the bare liner of my waterbed mattress. That probably explains most of the dream. But still, what kind of fucked up wish was that? Infinite power, and I wasted it on a dumb prank.",

And me, a greyish blue sphere, with feet. I don‚Äôt remember faces. I only remember the crack. The deep crevice in the ground, hauntingly deep. If you fell into this crack it would have you fall hundreds of feet down the mountain. But it was only 3 inches wide, and about 2 feet long.

She told me she just ended a 3.5 year relationship and was blind sided by it. I actually really felt bad for her. I guess her ex was sleeping with a woman she was pretty tight with and flaunted it to her while ending things\n\nI spent the night, didn‚Äôt want to make an hour drive at 3am. She was very embarrassed the next morning and I took her for coffee. We talked for about an hour. I didn‚Äôt talk to her much for about 3 months and she text me out of the blue. We went for dinner and finished what we started. Dated a bit for 2 months or so and ended it gracefully \n\nShe‚Äôs a really nice woman and this absolutely wrecked her self confidence.",

Most of the soldiers who survived the flood were caught on the wrong side of the river, where Goguryeo troops cut them down mercilessly.\n\nThe Chinese army sent to invade Goguryeo numbered 305,000 men, but of this expeditionary force, only 2,700 survived.

        "body": "One of the most lop-sided naval battles in history happened when Napoleon's navy chained all their ships together near some shoals in North Africa, with only the canons on the side facing out to sea prepared for battle since they expected any British naval engagement to happen on the seaward side. But when the British finally arrived, Horatio Nelson sailed half his ships into the narrow area on the side closer to shore (the French under-estimated how deep the water was on that side), and blasted the entire line of French ships to pieces from both sides, whereas the French were only prepared to fight back on one side. The French flagship ended up catching fire and its massive gunpowder magazine with something like 40 tons of gunpowder exploded in one of the largest explosions of its era. It was such a lop-sided victory that it essentially neutralized French naval power in the Mediterranean for the rest of the war. The British suffered roughly 250 casualties while the French lost 1,700 and had about 3,000 captured. Several French ships that were not utterly destroyed were captured and simply added to the strength of the British fleet. \n\nThe French weren‚Äôt entirely wrong about the risk of shallow water on the beach side. In the course of the battle several ships did run aground. But assuming the unpredictable Nelson wouldn‚Äôt send ships into the gap was a fatal miscalculation. \n\nThe fleet of ships that got destroyed in that battle left Napoleon and his army stranded in Egypt. The sinking of his flagship also sank the coins and treasure Napoleon was counting on to finance his military campaign in Egypt. Napoleon eventually got back, but I heard that he abandoned his troops in Egypt.\n\nHere's the video with a high quality animated reenactment of this decisive battle:\n\n# Epic History | [Nelson's Battles in 3D: The Nile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gJmaRZC2ROE)",

        "body": "The most disastrous mistake wasn't technically military when it happened, but it led to the destruction of the Khwarizmi empire.\n\nDuring the reign of Genghis Khan, the Mongolians sent a good will delegation to establish trade relationships with Khwarazm (located in modern Iran and the surrounding areas). This was in the period after the Mongols conquered China, and they were not looking to go to war, but to trade at this time.\n\nThe Shah of Khwarazm had surrounded himself with people who flattered him, and he had this delusional notion that he was the new Alexander, as did his officials. His uncle, who received the Mongolian delegation, killed the Mongols and stole their goods.\n\nNews of this got back to Genghis Khan, who was outraged. He sent another delegation demanding that the person responsible be punished. As if the original mistake wasn't bad enough, the Shah, who had been flattered into thinking that he was invincible, humiliated the Mongols, and sent them back, and I think killed a few more. Well, at that point, Genghis Khan went into rampage mode, and the Mongols launched a huge campaign against Khwarazm, basically laying siege to all their cities. Previously, the Mongols were not good at siege warfare, but after the conquest of China, they integrated Chinese siege engineers into their military, and became very adept at laying waste to fortified walled cities which their horse archers were mostly useless against.\n\nGrand and beautiful ancient Persian cities were reduced to ash, and the entire empire was wiped out. The bulk of the people lived in walled cities, and the bulk of those were annihilated, so basically, provoking the Mongols with such outrageous insult and treachery resulted in the empire being genocided and their cities reduced to ash and heaps of bones.\n\nThe shah's uncle was captured, and his greed and insolence was punished by having molten silver poured down his throat. The shah himself fled into exile and may have committed suicide. The most famous quote that emerged out of this was when Genghis Khan rounded up all the people in some city he was about to destroy (possibly the capital) into their grand mosque, and berated them from the pulpit, saying \"I am the flail of God! If you had not committed terrible sins, God would not have sent a punishment like me upon you!\"\n\nI learned about this from the Fall of Civilizations.\n\n# The Fall of Civilizations |  [The Mongols, Part V: Persia](https://youtu.be/PdFwMDuAnS4?t=10962)",

The true sign of civilization according to oft repeated testimonials of a quote of Margaret Meade \n\nMead said that the first sign of civilization in an ancient culture was a femur (thighbone) that had been broken and then healed. Mead explained that in the animal kingdom, if you break your leg, you die. You cannot run from danger, get to the river for a drink or hunt for food. You are meat for prowling beasts. No animal survives a broken leg long enough for the bone to heal.\n\nA broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery.

She told me that I was taking too much time and that I needed to get back to work. I was stunned, as this was in a professional environment, and I was a 42 year old making salary. Not wanting to make a scene, I said okay and went back to my desk.\n\nMy manager later came up to me and privately apologized, saying that she hadn't realized I was allowed a half hour break?!? She was an absolutely terrible micromanaging boss, and thank God I eventually got away from that job. My current place of employment treats me like the professional adult that I am.",

That kid took it home and his mum called the home number on it getting in contact with my mum.\n\nMy mum tells me somebody found my phone and they would be dropping it round later that day.

        "body": "Your brain gots lots of ways to be \"hacked\" by people who know how to. I tend to use my knowledge to avoid being hacked, but sometimes I use it to get things my way. Here are 3 biais you can use to your advantage (or recognise to avoid being used)\n\n1) If you accept to do something, you're more likely to accept to do something related to it even if it's not in your advantage. For example:\n\n> Boss : Hey, what time is it?\n\n> You : It's 5P.M.\n\n> B: Wow, it's getting late, by the way, have you checked your e-mails?\n\n> Y: yes, the client asked how complete is the project\n\n> B: can you answer real quick?\n\n> Y : yes, of course\n\n> B: Oh, and while you're at it, can you correct his invoice ?\n\nAnd then you're more likely to accept to do 1 additional hour of work, all because he asked you two questions and increased slowly the charge of the demand.\n\n2) If you refused to do something, you're most likely to accept to do something related even though it might not be something in your advantage. In the same vibe than the last example : \n\n> Boss : Hey, what time is it?\n\n> You : It's 5P.M.\n\n> B: Wow, it's getting late, by the way, have you checked your e-mails?\n\n> Y: yes, the client asked how complete is the project\n\n> B: Can you just finish the current item so we've reached a new threshold?\n\n> Y : Oh, I'm sorry, I have something planned, I can't stay for 2h today\n\n> B: Oh, I understand, can you at least correct his invoice? It'll be quick!\n\nAnd then you're most likely to accept to do it, because it feels like a compromise and you feel bad for refusing the last demand.\n\n3) People are more likely to accept rudeness if it comes from someone who they feel is in a superior social class (rich people). There has been a study where in different bakeries, 3 dudes would come and ask politely and rudely for the cashier to sell them something even though they're a few cents short. One of the dude was in a suite, one of the dude was in formal clothing, and the last one was in hobo clothes.\n\nAnd surprisingly, cashiers were more likely to accept the transaction with suite people than with others, but even worse was that people in suite had better results by being rude than by being polite, while it wasn't the case for others.",

They would say a lot of sexually inappropriate stuff to us, which was really disgusting. They'd say shit that, if I repeated it here, would earn me a ban. We were really uncomfortable, but for some reason, afraid to tell an adult. \n\nOne day, my brother and I were out riding our bicycles and we were in front of the grain elevator. I heard screaming and looked up toward the huge towers that were about 200ft high. Upon the scaffolding between the two towers hung two boys, screaming their heads off for help. I recognized them, it was John and Randy. They were hanging about 150 feet in the air, screaming for help.\n\nI looked at my brother, we turned around and went home. We didn't tell anyone, we just left them there. \n\nA little while later, I heard sirens. Someone else saw the boys and called the fire department for help. They were rescued and charged with trespassing, both boys ended up having to do community service. They never said a word to us about the incident, I don't know if they even saw us or not.",

For example, a minority group develops a musical subgenre born from a combination of different aspects of that group's history and culture that becomes the most popular form of music should be a credit to that group. \n\nHowever, if that group demonstrates higher rates in crime as a result of their minority status (lack of access due to racism, previous subjugation, no representation, etc), then they should not recieve blame.\n\nYou must also consider what you are defining as a minority. For instance, whites aren't a minority in the US; they are a majority. But white people from the UK living in the US are a minority. They likely don't experience the same systemic failures as other racial minorities do. \n\nI can't think of many factual circumstances in which a minority group should recieve blame for offending actions or statistics. Because they are almost always given a shit deal and consistently discriminated against.",

When you reach this stage in life, you have to plan, allocate time for people, and understand that people are doing the same for you. The worst thing you can do is cancel so **do not flake on people unless you absolutely have to**. Cancelling on somebody (especially last minute) is so much worse than it was before because their time is valuable and so is yours. Pick your friends wisely (a few of your best friends) and use more convenient ways to hang out (discord, gaming and watch parties are all great) as a way to pad the gap between in person meetings. \n\nIf you don't put the effort in to maintain your friendships, you will lose them over time.",

There's no point in starving yourself throughout the day if you're just going to come home and snack. Eat fulfilling meals throughout the day and the cravings will go. \n\n2) There's nothing wrong with snacking on healthy snacks. I always have fruit in my house, I eat a lot of Greek yoghurt to up my protein intake, I occasionally make homemade Granola bars or energy balls. You can also have the occasional treat. A couple of chocolate bars a week won't hurt your deficit. A chocolate bar every day will. \n\n3) Focus on why you are snacking. If it's because you're hungry then either just eat the snack and refer back to points 1 and 2. Sometimes though, its just out of habit or out of boredom. Truly listen to your hunger cues.",

I was late for the train, so walked slowly to catch the next train. As I came to the train station the train was delayed for about 10 min. leaving me just enough time to catch it.

We eventually mutually agreed to part ways and cut contact and agreed to move on. No problem, no fuzz. \n\nI got into a new, and very healthy relationship some time after (which I am still in, and I am about to propose to her in a few weeks). 4 months into my new relationship she contacted me again, and it was very obvious from the way she talked that she was regretting her decision. She started crying for no reason other than talking to me again and I felt that was a que to tell her I had moved on and found a new partner because it sounded fake and manipulating. This seared into my mind as really weird, like she was crying over spilt milk, or crocodile tears. Around the holidays we wished each other a merry xmas, and on NYE she made it very clear in some text messages that she regret her decision. She said she missed me, and wished I was with her, and sent me pictures of her kids (they are not mine, and it creeped me the fuck out and I asked her to please not do that any more!), and told me my girlfriend was very lucky to \"get\" me. This was the first time I found her to be very uncomfortable, and I kind of just laughed it off because it felt unhinged and manipulating. I also showed it to my girlfriend, who also laughed it off. We are very open with each other, but she asked me to not have any contact with her because of how weird the nature of the conversation was. \n\nHalf a year goes on, we're in the process of moving into our new home that we bought together and bam... my old fling texted me again. She vomited a story about her going into a spiral of mental illness, in and out of psychiatry some time after we split (we weren't even a couple), she lost custody on one of her kids, and she cried her self to sleep every time she thought of me. At this point I told her off. I was very blunt and asked her to not contact me, I removed any access she had to my social profiles and deleted the number. I also explained to her that we both agreed to move on, and that she was the one seeking someone more experienced. \n\nThere's multiple red flags, like she's extremely devout Christian. The next one shouldn't really be a red flag but she has four kids with three different dads. I can live with that in a person who wants to settles down but she very clearly didn't want to do that with me, which is why we split. Also her sending pictures of her kids to me after we split for no particular reason: MAJOR red flag. I think she thought she would be able to toy with me, and got caught off guard when I had not only moved on but also found a new partner. We have not had contact since that last interaction and I am very happy for that. Again, not an amazing story, just a sad interaction with a person who I believe wanted someone to toy with.",

For a background:\n\nMy gf and I are both 19F; I‚Äôm Canadian, she‚Äôs French. We met in my town at 17 while she was an exchange student and quickly became inseparable friends, and then started dating (we haven‚Äôt told her parents, though we‚Äôre quite sure they know). She went back to France before summer, and I flew to her city 2 months later. My plan was to spend the winter in the alps, travel Europe a bit, and rent an apartment in her city the rest of the time (while learning French and taking a gap year). Her parents agreed to let me stay for a month while I found housing. Unfortunately, my visa made it impossible to rent anything, which her parents expected. They‚Äôre incredibly kind people and told me to stay until Christmas; reluctantly I accepted their kind offer. I left for January to ski, and when I came back to her city, they pushed for me to continuing staying with them, rent-free. I‚Äôve offered to pay rent, groceries, utilities, etc. but they decline every time. I bake for them multiple times a week (buying my own ingredients of course) in hopes that it shows my appreciation somewhat. I know this isn‚Äôt enough though.\n\nThey house me, have sit-down meals with me everyday, we have coffee together, they took me to Disneyland, 3 small beach vacations, every family event/birthday/Christmas‚Ä¶they treat me as part of the family. My gf and I leave in a month for Canada, where we‚Äôll spend the summer and then return to France to study in September. At this point I‚Äôll have a different visa and can rent my own place (though they‚Äôve offered for me to return). How am I supposed to possibly thank them for such kindness?\n\nNote: they work with people for a living and are the kindest, most real people I know. Their oldest (21) also lives at home, and his gf (22) is here most days as well.",

She still tried the classic blaming the non-cheating spouse trick. She still tried to figure out what I knew, what I guessed. I got the would-be AP was preying on her because she was vulnerable. She even trotted out the venerable ‚Äúif you do forgive me, we will never speak of this again.‚Äù And I almost left again because it was all so textbook. But I really didn‚Äôt want the nuclear option I 100% would‚Äôve chosen early in our marriage. And, if i genuinely believed that the cheating had at any point actually progressed to in-person interaction, I still would‚Äôve left. \n\nIt all still broke me a little. It can‚Äôt not when the one person you‚Äôve put all your trust in betrays it. It‚Äôs funny, because I‚Äôve completely forgiven her. Truly. And I love her every bit as much as I always have. But I no longer completely trust her, I can‚Äôt. And I think it really gets to her, but it‚Äôs not something I can control.",

I pulled the tube straight out of my mouth and removed all the IV lines attached to my arms. I almost removed the one attached to my wrist, which could‚Äôve been much worse. Thankfully, a nurse arrived just in time and stopped me. That‚Äôs when I finally came back to my senses.

Took way longer to heal than I was told it would, and wasn‚Äôt a whole lot of fun.  \n\nBoth procedures were laparoscopic (just 5 little holes made for all the surgical tools to go in, no great big scar) which as I understand it will have made recovery much easier.",

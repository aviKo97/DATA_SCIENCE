If it's a single circuit, the absolute gold standard is something like the [Intermatic FF5M](https://www.intermatic.com/Product/FF5M) (other time spans are available, but this is the shortest them make). It's a 1-5 minute wind up timer switch, and I've never seen one break, only one that wore out after 40 years of use. I used one to power my inverter in my camping van, because I kept forgetting to flip the switch off after I was done and the inverter would drain the house battery sitting there on standby.",

Adding some to the back does make some sense from a traction point of view. It’s in a bad location (you want the weight closer to the wheels, not way out at the end) but it would work. More weight on the back wheels, accomplished. \n\n(You could also get that weight by just throwing the bagged concrete into the bed of the truck. Or just use sand or kitty litter like a normal person.)\n\nWould it make a good bumper? No. Concrete has amazing compressive strength but it doesn’t hold up in other ways. It’s brittle and has little tensile or flexural strength. It will break rather than holding up when hit. The lack of flexural strength will be the downfall of your idea. \n\nCould you get a steel pipe or tube, cap the end, pour concrete into it, and would that make a strong bumper? Yes. The steel would provide the tensile and flexural strength and the concrete would be held in compression, also holding the steel rather than letting it buckle, so it’d be one hell of a strong bumper. That’s good and bad; bumpers are supposed to absorb shock, not just pass it on to the bodies of the vehicle occupants. \n\nSo yeah you could do concrete filled tubular bumpers for shits and giggles. You could not use your original bumper as a form because the concrete would just pop out the back at the slightest impact, at which point it poses a safety hazard for all. \n\nBut you could zip tie the original bumper over the tubular one. Certainly don’t use proper hardware; it wouldn’t fit the aesthetic. Maybe a little duct tape and/or baling wire for proper effect. \n\nThis whole idea kinda poses a safety hazard. And I’m here for it. Good luck my friend.",

        "body": "Very interesting question.  \n\nHere is some informaiton:\n\n\n**Electricity**\n>Transmitting electricity at high voltage reduces the fraction of energy lost to Joule heating, which varies by conductor type, the current, and the transmission distance. For example, a 100 miles (160 km) span at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 0.5% to 1.1%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power_transmission)\n\n**Oil**\n>The energy costs of a large pipeline can be approximated at around 0.5 kWh per bbl per 100km [source](https://thundersaidenergy.com/downloads/pipelines-the-energy-economics/) \n\nThere are about 1700 kWh in a bbl of oil.\n\n**Natural gas**\n\nSorry, couldn't find anything in 5 minutes of googling.\n\n**Comparison**\n\nOil transmission requires about 0.03% of the energy in the oil to move the oil 100 km.  Electric transmission loses about 0.3% over 100 km.\n\nSo based on these numbers, it is about 10 times more efficient to move oil.\n\nHowever, because of the laws of thermodynamics, burning oil to turn it into electricity is only like 33% efficient.  So if you burn oil containing 100 J of energy, you will get about 33 J of electricity from that.\n\nSo if we move 33 J of electricity, we will lose 0.1 Joules in transmission losses.  But we would have to move 100 J worth of oil to a city if we are going to convert it to 33 Joules of electricity once it gets to the city.  And if we are moving 100 J of oil, we need to use 0.03 J of energy to move that oil.\n\nSo really, moving oil isn't 10 times more efficient.  It is 3 times more efficient.\n\nAlso, someone is probably going to reply to this comment, claiming that my statement that 33% efficiency in converting oil to electricity is wrong, and that it is possible to be more efficient than that.  They would be correct.  But I'm in the ballpark.",

This can be remedied with lubrication, which then adds another level of messiness to the system. This is why, for example, you'll find ball joints on cars packed with grease.",

Then there’s contamination, and surface degradation.  \n\nSo how uniform do you need the friction to be?  Is it just so it feels even for a user?  Most people aren’t terribly good about noticing small changes in friction.  You may find that “stiction”, or the difference between static and dynamic friction is much more noticeable. If you’ve used something like Loc-Line hose, they are meant to stay in position until you push them, then they move easily until they stop.  It doesn’t feel supple, but damned if it’s not effective and ubiquitous. \n\nHow much of a range of motion do you need?  How many adjustments will it see over its service life, hundreds or hundreds of thousands?  Do you have the option for adjustments?",

The mechanical digital computer inside the watch encodes the how many days in a month, months in a year, etc via gears profiles or cam profiles.\n\nSimplest: triple date option: it just assumes that every month has 31 days. You have manually readjust every 1-2 months.\n\nMedium: annual calendar: it assumes that the months have a 31-30-31-30-31-30-31-31-30-31-30-31 cycle. So it doesn't know about February and doesn't know about leap years.\n\nMost complex: perpetual calendar watches. Knows about February and knows about leap years. Can operate without manual intervention for hundreds or even thousands of years.\n\nHere's an [example of a perpetual calendar watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ympmtk8Zqus) with the operating details.

The aircraft is descending and the cabin altitude is descending with it, the differential pressure between inside and outside actually goes down, despite it seeming to increase (cabin altitude reducing). The pressurisation system is set up to match the profile of the aircraft in flight, just with the cabin altitude being a ratio of the actual altitude. It's all about the differential pressure, not about the actual pressure in the cabin. Almost all pressurised aircraft have a design typical cabin altitude, usually this figure is what can be maintained at the service ceiling of the aircraft.\n\nThe 737 NG (presumably you were on one) uses the following differential pressure settings for cruise, dependant on cruise altitude set in the system:\n\n* At cruise altitudes at or below FL 280, the max differential is 7.45 PSI. which will result in a cabin altitude of 8000’ at FL280.\n* At cruise altitudes above FL280 but below FL370, the max differential is 7.80 PSI. which will result in a cabin altitude of 8000’ at FL370.\n* At cruise altitudes above FL 370, the max differential is 8.35 PSI. which will result in a cabin altitude of 8000’ at FL410.\n\nThis is a bit different to other Boeing jets, such as the 777 and 787, where they follow more closely a target pressure differential.",

CUZ is 10,860 feet above sea level. \n\nThe altitude sickness resolved itself when I descended from Ollantaytambo (9200 feet) to Aguas Calientes (6700 feet).\n\nI believe the pressure stays constant in the cabin until the ambient pressure outside the plane is higher than inside.

I think it's worth pointing out that even if you squat 200kg that would be very impressive for a human to lift, but it still isnt that much weight. 3 average sized people would weigh more than that and you'd expect plenty of much more flimsy things to safely hold that much weight.\n\nThe biggest concern in designing these things is probably making sure they don't tip over. You could easily make something strong enough to hold more weight than you can fit on a barbell, but if you make it too light it could potentially be unstable.",

The engineer calculates the expected max loads, doubles or triples those, and using some formulas ends up with a profile for the parts that is strong enough to hold a certain weight without damage.\n\nHow does this specific construction manage to be so strong even though it looks flimsy and doesn't weigh a lot, is what I think your real question is. And the simple answer is that it's tubular (hollow) profiles. A hollow profile is much stronger than a solid profile of the same shape weight. This happens because the stresses from bending are maximized at the outside of the profile, compression on one side and extension on the opposite side. Therefore in the middle, there is no stress, so also no need for material to oppose this stress.\n\nAnother essential reason why they can be made this way is the intelligent application of torsional inertia of shapes. Depending on which direction a profile is stressed it will be more or less likely to deform. For example a plastic ruler, when held flat will bend under its own weight, but rotate it around its long axis and suddenly it is much stronger.\n\nEdit: they don't tip over because of the very large base compared to where the weight is held up.",

This may sound like a minor thing, but believe me, it was revolutionary and saved thousands of miners' lives in the early 1800s.\n\nWhat he discovered was that flames will not propagate past metal mesh screen of a certain fineness.  Which when working in coal mines which naturally give off flammable gasses, enabled construction of a lantern which could safely contain a flame even within an explosive atmosphere. The flame would flare brighter as the gas mixture entered the combustion chamber, but the flames would not be able to escape the mesh.\n\nAnd the principle is simply that the metal mesh cooled the flame sufficiently that it is unable to pass through and ignite anything beyond.\n\nThe same principle of cooling a flame applies to tubes. And there are several studies that give minimum tube dimensions. But like the Davy lamp, if you decrease the tube diameter sufficiently, the length also decreases until it's so short that your tube has become a circle. \n\nWhich is exactly the same size as the screens Davy discovered.",

Bending a paperclip produces millions of dislocations without much force. Once a dislocation is formed, the stress must be reapplied at the intensity that produced the dislocation originally in order to further deform it. However, across a large body containing the potential for numerous dislocations, it is near certainty that a new dislocation would form before an existing dislocation could be resolved, and so the system over time under stable cyclic loading would develop towards a system of propagating dislocations throughout the material body. This series of dislocations would accumulate until the internal stress within the lattice caused by these dislocations becomes greater than the binding force of the lattice and a fracture then forms.",

Try to remember how many cycles a steel spring can go through before it has problems. Your engine's valve springs, for example, compress quite a bit to open and close each valve every two revolutions of the engine, which means it compresses perhaps an average of a thousand times a minute for every minute you're driving. Many years of driving and half a million miles later, they're still good when the car goes to the scrapyard. So, well, that's one hell of a fatigue test and steel passes it just fine. There may be a theoretical limit to how many times it'll compress before it fails, but is there a practical limit?\n\nThe reason we've long known about this for aluminum, is because it really matters on aluminum. It's a pretty lousy material from a fatigue perspective, yet it has other qualities that make it a very important material. We have to carefully design aluminum airplanes with that in mind. They have a finite service life, and we meticulously test everything to guarantee it will last as long as it needs to. We watch the clock, and we stop using the product when we can no longer guarantee it is within its fatigue life.\n\nNobody does that with steel. Because there's really no point. A steel spring being used only in its elastic region, will outlive your grandchildren. I will die of old age before I finish my test. Fatigue testing on steel still needs to be done on highly stressed structural parts, but for most stuff it's not nearly as meticulously watched because its cycle limit is usually so high that it just doesn't matter.\n\nSo what you say might be true in theory, but in practice some materials have to be worried about much more than others.",

        "body": "Hey there, I led engineering efforts at a major shaving company company for a few years.  While I wasn't involved in the blade manufacturing process, I was very familiar with it.  In short: everything impacts the quality of a blade.\n\n* Start by defining \"sharpness.\"  It's a surprisingly interesting problem to attack.  Is it an edge that can penetrate to X-distance with the least amount of force?  The one who can penetrate the furthest?  The one who can do it repeatedly?  A \"good\" blade is based on your needs.  Example: A shaving razor blade is significantly sharper than a scalpel, but will dull much faster.  Since surgeons want to be practiced and repeatable, scalpel blades are designed to have the same \"sharpness\" on every blade, and that blade lasts a \"long\" time; to achieve this, they have a much less \"sharp\" (by force-to-distance) blade than you'll find in any modern razor cartridge.\n* Blade material and temper impacts the ability to form an edge and the ability to form a shape (i.e. bend the blade, stamp fiducial features, etc).  You may want high carbon for a very \"sharp\" (but flimsy) edge, or low carbon for the inverse.  We'd weaken our steel to form the features we needed, then harden it to form the edge, then weaken it slightly to add a bend to it for assembly.\n* Coatings are IMPORTANT.  You'll often see companies use DLC - Diamond Like Carbon - to enhance the hardness and durability of their blades.  You'll also see PTFE sintered onto blades (via either an alcohol or water solution) to reduce friction during cutting.  The PTFE one is interesting, as when you sinter it, you'll end up with a build-up of PTFE on the blade edge that thins out to sub-micron thickness after the first few passes.  One company has a patent on how they thin the PTFE coating through blasting it with a focused ion beam, making the first pass of the razor very smooth.\n\nOverall, \"sharpness\" is a term dependent on your industry/product goals, your base material, your processing, and your coatings.  Scale makes things like ion-beam PTFE thinning possible/economical, but most places that use blades in their products are not manufacturing the blade themselves - they're working with a dedicated blade manufacturer to design a blade for their needs.",

The pinch welds are very reliable, they all have tens of kN of force on the pinch before the spot weld happens, and the robots will fault out if there is insufficient press force or current. Additionally, there are tons of welds, usually 200-500 around most body panels, so even if one is slightly off, that entire panel is likely supported by another 200+ welds, and kept from bending by cross-bracing from the other panels. Body welds are very dialed-in in automotive, for both structural integrity and panel gaps. It's not well known, but most automotive manufacturers outsource panel robotics because it's an absolute art form, there's probably only a hundred or so people around the world that travel and can lead a crew in robotics body line work. We all know each other, and the GOATs are absolute legends- they can save your company tens of millions a year with a few keystrokes.\n  \nIt's also why Tesla panel gaps are so bad- their 'move fast and break stuff' policy assumes that 95% of a skill can be learned through shortcuts/google/read a book, instead of struggling with actually good design and and/or iteration.

Such as bullet drop, velocity changes, due to drag etc. While factors such as coriolis humidity, air temperature, all matter to extreme long-range ballistics, those really only add up to inches at a thousand yards. And since we're talking statistics, I'm assuming that this will be some type of rapid fire, fully automatic platform.

So where I would start would be any sort of academic papers related to rate of fire and accuracy. Because to me, the difficult part is knowing where the target is, estimating where it will be, and leading that enough so my cloud of projectiles hits it. Like during trap shooting, I've learned to do this instinctively. Obviously, it's harder to program. That's second order difficulty. Third order is getting the weapon aimed and firing. Point of aim versus point of impact on a moving target. Plus tracking, which you'll need. Because of you can't see it, you can't hit it. And then finally the controls to tie it all together. And all that is dependent on a gun system that's stable/stuff enough to get in target and stay there after firing a couple rounds. \n\nSo, controls, basic physics, machinery design, and integration would be what I'd want for my team.",

The weight and overall height of the LEM had increased, the center of gravity had been moved upward, the LEM stability analysis had expanded to cover a wider range of landing conditions, the cruciform descent stage had been selected, and the interpretation of the lunar model had been revised. These changes necessitated a larger gear diameter than at first proposed. This, in turn, required deployable rather than fixed legs so the larger gear could be stored in the Saturn V adapter. MSC had therefore adopted a four-legged deployable gear, which was lighter and more reliable than the five-legged configuration.\"",

If you draw a line between the foot pads of the apollo lander, it makes a square, with the highest chance of tip over being if you fall in a direction directly between any two legs. \n\nIf you instead had 3 legs of the same size, and drew the lines between the foot pads, you get an equilateral triangle. To make a 3 leg lander as stable as a 4 legged one, it would have to be scaled up such that the min distance from the center to any side is equivalent to the square.\n\nTry this: draw a square. Then draw the largest circle that fits inside the square. Then draw the smallest triangle that fits over that circle. \n\nYou’ll find the sides of the triangle will be roughly twice as big, hence the 3 legs would have to be twice as large, and your 4 legged lander comes out significantly lighter.  You get diminishing returns after 4 legs, where 5 and 6 could possibly save you weight, but the gains are small, and packaging them in a vehicle generally gets harder\n\nSource: have done some of these tipover calcs for a project",

This is also why different cars can have different charge curves on the same charger.\n\nUsing the example of CCS and NACS, they're much more similar than different. The communication on the pilot and proximity lines (at least for AC charging) is exactly the same, which is why to adapt between the two you only need a \"dumb\" adapter with no chips in it.\n\nDC charging is where they differ. Because NACS uses the same two contacts for AC and DC charging **an extra two contactors are required in the vehicle to switch**. The comms for DC charging - while similar - are also different to allow for this switchover. But I haven't spent as much time with the CCS spec as I have with the J1772 spec and haven't looked closely at the line comms of the NACS DC spec. The downside of NACS means that it requires additional components on the vehicle instead of leaving that cost in the charging station.\n\nCHADeMO is a totally different beast. In Nissan's defense they were pretty far out ahead of the industry and had to create some kind of charging standard but it isn't the best system. Hindsight is 20/20. Your dad's adapter is talking to the vehicle as if it's a CHADeMO charging station and talking to the NACS/CCS charger as if it's a vehicle.

Some L2 stations/chargers (most actually) do some kind of current monitoring, ground integrity monitoring (think GFCI), and regularly make sure the vehicle is actually still plugged in.  Adapters just line up the wires so things can talk and pass power. Generally, they use the same protocol (except for Tesla, who uses a proprietary protocol but whose chargers can be often be put in J1772 mode if you have multiple EVs).\n\nDC/L3 is a little different in that the regulation of current flow happens in the charger. The car provides exact specifications for voltage to set the charge flow to and the charger makes it happen.  During L3 charging, the charger is directly connected to the battery DC and there is no intermediate equipment in the vehicle.  Again, adapters just line up pins so things can communicate and current can flow).  Much like L2, there are various communication protocols, but chargers like Tesla can charge a variety of vehicles by being able to operate under different laws (of operation, not legal laws), so if the adapter exists to make it fit, it can often charge.\n\nI can’t speak much for CHAdeMO, despite owning a leaf, since it barely exists in the world so I’ve never had to design for it, repair it, or dig into it at all.",

Couple of major differences. \n\nR454b and R32 run at higher pressures than R22, so components need to be rated to run at those higher pressures. This mostly affects anything between your compressor discharge and expansion device, so your condenser, receiver, and drier mainly.\n\nYou can run into oil compatibility issues with both your drier and refrgerant. If you have a drier that says 100% molecular sieve, as long as prssure rating is ok and it’s sized correctly for the system, you’re good to go (although best practice is to change drier any time you open the refrgeration system) If it mentions activated alumina, don’t use it with POE oils. R454B and R32 typically use a POE oil and in lower evaporating temp applications sometimes PAG. Most older R22 systems run mineral oil which is not miscible in most modern refrgerants which can lead to poor oil return to your compressor which can result in a lot of wear on the compressor.\n\nMotor size to displacement of the compressor. Higher pressure refrigerants like R32 and R454b run at lower mass flow rates for the same amount of cooling, so, assuming same efficiencies, your compressor will need a larger motor for the same displacement. Swapping R454b in into an R22 system will result in higher amp draws on your compressor than it may be able to handle resulting in burned out wiring.\n\nR32 and R454b are also flammable refrigerants while R22 is not. I know compressor manufacturers are needing to do extra steps to certify compressors for applications with flammable refrigerants and I only know of a few manufacturers who have been able to take their existing design of an R410A (similar P-T curves to R454b) compressor and make it directly compatible with R454b.\n\nIf your system has a txv, you would also need a different bulb charge. You could use a R410A bulb in a R454b system due to similar P-T curves in 98% of cases. If your system uses a cap tube as an expansion device it will be oversized and you will get liquid back on your compressor which will kill it.\n\nAs for evap sizing, if you have a txv that happened to have a replacement power head, like the majority of sporlans for example, and you switched to a correct bulb charge you’d run at slightly lower evaporating tenps than r22 but nothing that will be an issue in 99% of applications. This is due to R454b and R32 having a lower mass flow rate and slightly worse heat transfer coefficient, r454b has a glide which also doesn’t help.\n\nR454b and R32 also will run at slightly higher condensing temperatures for the same reasons, this can be an issue if your condenser is very critically sized but like 80% of the time you’ll be ok.\n\nThat’s at least the major issues off the top of my head.",

The recondensed water is then pumped back into the boiler, which requires energy.\n\nNeither approach works with yours: the pressure is lower than ambient, so you can't vent the steam to the environment, and the ambient temperature during the day isn't low enough to recondense the below-ambient steam for a closed loop.\n\nThe other problem is that heat engines work most efficiently with as large a temperature difference as possible. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_engine#Efficiency The maximum practical efficiency of an engine between those temperatures is 4.1%\n\nWhich isn't to say you couldn't extract energy from the difference of temperature between a mass of water and the ambient temperature. You could stick a Stirling engine on it and extract a bit of energy without needing all the boiling and condensing mechanisms. Or a thermopile, with even worse efficiency. It's just not going to be much power considering the effort.",

As you draw water from the tank to use it then water flows out (current) and the pressure drops (voltage). If you have enough pressure from the pump (voltage) then the flow comes out from the pump (power supply) and not the tank (battery). You can think of the volume of water as the Wh to f the battery. \n\nSo if you have a very high pressure (from the main) you need to reduce it to what the tank can hold (battery regulator) and if you don’t and push higher then eventually the tank fills up and pushes back and if you don’t stop then it breaks down and catches on fire or breaks. So you push with the voltage the battery is design to charge at and eventually it fills up and the voltages equalize and the current goes to zero. If the supply voltage drops then the battery pushes current out to hold it until it can’t (battery is empty) and the voltage drops below the minimum.",

So pulling away in 1st means you're slipping the clutch until the wheels spin at 150rpm, pulling away in 6th gear would mean slipping the clutch until the wheels are spinning at 1500rpm.

I'm a materials engineer, a specialist in composite materials, and particularly with defining testing programmes for material selection, characterisation, and building up the test pyramid for FEA correlation activities.\n\nTo answer your main question, to get lamina properties, you don't test a single ply, you make a laminate of the material you want to test with the same orientation for all plies. So if, for example, your material in question is a 2x2 twill, you want a layup up to the approx. 2.4 mm thickness you require (so calculate your cured ply thickness for a single laminate, divide 2.5 by that and that tells you how many plies), all with a 0deg orientation. Your test panel needs to be big enough to cut your test coupons from, and you'll need 0o, 90o and 45o orientation for your test coupons from your sheet.\n\nNow, if you're really getting into the weeds on this (which you won't be for your project) you want to also assess for material variability, which is quite high in composites, so in industry what we aim for is a 3 batch qualification I.e. 3 batches of laminates manufactured from at least two batches of fibre and two batches of resin (e g. batch 1 is A/A, batch 2 is A/B and batch 3 is B/B) plus you can't manufacture all panels for all batches in one shot (e.g. if you're using prepreg you can't go cure them all in one autoclave cycle because then you're missing manufacturing variability information in your data).\n\nNext big thing: when you're post-processing your material data do not forget to normalise your results to nominal fibre volume fraction based on measured sample thicknesses. I highly recommend MIL-HDBK-17 Part E or CMH-17 to understand more about how to design a test programme and how to statistically process your data.\n\nRemember this is all about defining your LAMINA properties to enable you to do design. You will need to do higher level tests to correlate and then validate your simulations as well. Normally, after lamina data, you want go do some laminate-level testing (i.e. your intended laminate) in a representative but still simplified load case to allow for correlation of your FEA and from there, you move into sub-component or component level testing.\n\nNow, honestly, for your rocket club, it's unlikely that you have the resources to do all of this, and as a first step, using some book values for your lamina properties with some generous safety factors will probably do you well enough. If you want to have more of a chat to figure out something that is more appropriate for your scheme then drop me a message.",

If there is a prescribed torque for a bolt and nut configuration, it would be challenging to ensure both nuts are torqued correctly. Also if there is a grade requirement for the nut and bolt, the thread would also need to be verifiable. That couldn't be done a a cut piece of all thread for example. \n\n\nFor a rudimentary or over engineered connection it could be fine. But if an engineering drawing for an important connection or important piece of equipment then the joint was likely prescribed that way and reviewed. I'm not saying in those cases a replacement with studs and nuts wouldn't be ok, just that it wasn't analyzed that way. It's possible the torque on each nut would be different (higher or lower than a single nut) and as the person making the change you absorb the liability then should the joint now fail.\n\n\nAnother final thing to consider is intended failure method. A bolt and nut configuration is intended to yield or break at the bolt head, and not a long the shaft or threads. If your working on something like a crash structure or suspension of a car for example, the bolt could be intended to yield and break in a crash to remove energy from reaching the passenger compartment. Changing that, even with stronger connections, could result in unintended consequences or a more dangerous breaking point that could cause worse issues. ",

It would be quite difficult to scale it effectively and make use of a Venturi, vs just getting another fan. \n\n\nThat compressed or pressurized gas is all moving in one direction and at high speed. That means that when it hits the Venturi mechanism, the high pressure stream stays straight and the molecules of ambient air on the side get bounced forward with the high pressure stream. It does increase airflow by pulling in the ambient air but it also slows down the overall all flow. \n\n\nThe problem with a fan is that there isn't much force pushing/pulling the air and the air stream exiting is full of vortices, spirals, and turbulence. It's not flowing smoothly in one direction. So the first step is to get the air moving in one direction. Fans are so bad at this, that in needed applications like wind tunnels, the fan is put behind the test section so that the blades don't create a bunch of disturbance to the straight flow. It's easier to just pull the air through a tunnel than to push. They also use much larger fans than the space, as the diameter of the blades has an impact on the effectiveness of the push/pull. This still doesn't consider that the airflow is also quite slow coming out of a fan (maybe a few m/s vs 100s of m/s for compressed air). Because of the low speed, energy is lost very quickly due to any disturbance. It's why you rarely if ever see a nozzle on a fan. It is just most effective to position the fan in a good spot and then let it push all the surrounding air immediately. ",

        "body": "So you're imagining a simple series circuit with multiple resistors, yeah? Let's stick with that for now but keep in mind that local current, to use your words, *does* exist in more complicated networks. Hopefully, you'll get an \"ah hah\" when we come back to that. \n\nIndulge me for just a sec while I throw a law at you. Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL). The sum of all voltages around a closed loop equals zero. Always. You start at the supply, drop over each resistor, and then get pushed back up by the supply. You must start and end at the same spot. \n\nOk, let's jump into analogy and then we'll come back to the circuit. Conservation of energy. You gain gravitational potential when you walk uphill, and you lose the potential when you walk downhill. Ride an elevator to the top of a building and then take the stairs back down. You start and end with the same gravitational potential energy, but it varies throughout the trip. That's conservation of energy.\n\nEach step you take downhill is like stepping over a resistor in your circuit. You lose lots of gravitational potential when you take a step when the path is steep, and you only lose a little when the path is nearly flat. Here, the slope angle serves as resistance.\n\nOk, here's the thing. Voltage isn't your energy at any given point. Voltage is the *difference in potential energy* between the beginning and end of your step. Current exists and is measurable at a single point, but it's meaningless to ask about the voltage at a single point. Maybe you've gotten over that stumbling point already, but it gets pretty much everyone at some point so it's worth saying. \n\nKVL is conservation of energy for voltage. There's another term for voltage, by the way: electrical potential (ooh!).\n\nSimilarly, there's KCL that states that current into a node always equals the current out. That makes sense because each electron that enters a resistor pushes a different electron out the other end. \n\nYour simple series circuit is a closed loop. If you're thinking of the current leaving the supply as the \"global current\", then the total supply voltage is the \"global voltage.\" That's a valid apples-to-apples comparison. That's applying both KVL and KCL to the entire circuit.\n\nThe supply is doing the pushing that causes all of the current. There's no active push coming from the resistors themselves, but rather the measured \"local\" voltage drop just tells you how much of the supply's push is needed to get the electrons through that section. The elevator gave you all of the energy, and your steps down just give it back.\n\nWhat happens when your circuit gets a little more complicated and you put two resistors in parallel? Well, the current splits. Some electrons take one path and others take the other path, and the ratio changes based on the difference in the resistance for each branch. Boom! There's your local current. \n\nNow, of course you can start applying circuit analysis techniques to simplify like combining the parallel resistors into their equivalent resistance, and then start adding up the series resistors until you're left with one power supply, one equivalent series resistance, and nothing else. From here it should be easy to see that there's one \"global* current and one \"global\" voltage, right? \n\nThe confusion enters when you think about the varying \"local\" voltage because you're performing an invalid comparison. Your total current comes from the completely simplified circuit, but then you explode it back out into individual branches to start looking at individual steps along the path. You're using KCL on the whole circuit and then comparing that to a small bit of nodal analysis applied to one corner of the circuit. That's apples to oranges.",

They make your arrow flies crappy, they don’t really do anything and they are more dangerous to the user than the target. \n\nFundamentally this is a heat transfer problem. More specifically the engineering problem is the lack of mass and overall energy content you can carry on something as small as a tooth pick; then transfer however much of that tiny amount of energy into the target to heat it up enough to ignite. On top of that your target is a cardboard box. You need to heat up cardboard to 450F is before it will ignite and create a self-sustained combustion. Whatever ignition source you can carry on the tooth pick doesn’t pack enough energy to actually heat the cardboard. Even if you concentrate all of the energy you can fit into a toothpick and dump it into a bug cardboard box, the cardboard box (if sufficiently large) can just absorb that heat and raise the temperature of the box a little.  You need to raise the temperature of at least a little bit of the box to its ignition temperature. This is why you might see flame for a sec but the cardboard doesn’t ignite because the energy is absorbed into the cardboard or  is dumped into the rest of the surroundings. \n\nTo solve this problem you need to be able to pack a lot more energy than what a toothpick can reasonably carry or change your target that’s more easily combustible. When you go start a camp fire you don’t just heat up a log until the fire starts, cuz you will be there forever trying to pump enough energy into the wood to get it to ignite. To start a campfire you ignite kindling and the kindling is the stuff that provides sufficient energy and heat transfer needed to ignite the log. You have the same problem as trying to start a fire on a log without kindling.",

At the time, my own spitball design indicated the weight increase would be substantial (<30 lb) but manageable. The bushings would be replaceable as well, without removal of the new weldment...just remove the wing and replace the bushings in-situ. \n\nA steel weldment would not have a practical fatigue limit, and work hardening/cracking potential could be designed out of the part with careful design. \n\nIf there is a market for this approach (it has been a while since the ad came out), I think there is a commercial opportunity to produce a STC for the steel replacement.\n\nHere is one of many papers on cold working aluminum: \nhttps://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/2888063",

The dam has a hydropower plant built in 1953 and not used nowadays anymore. When it turned out that the blackout lasted longer then expected, they decided to turn the plant on again to start producing energy. So we were the firsts in Portugal to get reconnected to the grid, just locally. I, and many of my neighbors also have solar panels so the moment we got reconnected we started to provide energy to the grid as well which enabled them to connect more households. \n\nSo far, there is no info what really caused the issue. All I know is that several of my electrical appliances died during the blackout. Either just before the lights went out of the moment we got reconnected.",

To be honest I think a modern jet equivalent of a Mosquito would be composite, rather than wood per se.\n\nThat same company (De Havilland) made a generation wooden jets, the Vampire, Venom etc to great success. However these were not totally constructed from wood, instead the fuselage section was constructed from wood and the wings/tail are constructed from metal.\n\nA Wooden SR-71 would be impractical due to the extreme heat from air friction on the skin of the aircraft (I’m guessing the wood would just burn?). \n\nBut that raises an interesting point, could the SR71 be re-manufactured today using composite technology, instead of titanium? If it could what would it look like? \n\nIs there composites that can handle that high of a temperature? Alternatively would the aircraft have to be coated in some kind of ceramic material, or heat shield tiles (like the space shuttle)? At what speed/temperature does it become impractical to use composites and requires Titanium/inconel etc?",

I would estimate that around 40-50 MW of heating capacity is being installed yearly, ranging from small 1 MW system for smaller towns to large +10 MW systems for larger cities. To adress some of your questions: \n\nThe generel trend in Denmark is to use air as the heat source. While it performs worse during winter (we generally have milder winters but it goes below freezing for some months), the heat pump will tend to perform better during summer, where there is still a sizeable heat demand for hot water, due to the ambient temperature being higher than ground water. Environmentally speaking it is also easier to get permits for air source heat pumps than getting permits for drilling into the ground. \n\nThe heat in all district heating systems are supplied as hot water. You would never really be able to do it with refrigerants (not counting water), since it would be too costly or unsafe. Synthetic refrigerants are expensive and environmentally harmful. While natural refrigerants often are unsafe for humans in case of a leak. Using water as a carrier (heat transfer fluid) is ideal because it is cheap and in case of a leak it does not pose any imidiate danger.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any further questions or what me to elaborate on some details. I'm general large scale heat pumps are seen as a successful endavour, but part of it is due to the existing district heating network. Without the network it would generally be more viable to have individual household heat pumps.",

(don't quote me on the exact pressure). But you can't pump all the water into the membrane and leave solid salts on the seawater side. You need some brine to flow out to carry away the salt still in solution. So the saltwater flow rate must be much higher than the freshwater flow rate. A lot of desalinators accomplish this by using a small orifice that allows the brine to escape from the high pressure chamber. This is wasteful of energy.\n\nSome small desalinators use an energy recovery mechanism to scavenge some of the energy from the pressurized brine. The clarke pump.\n\nFor large desalinators there is another mechanism. I think it is kind of like a turbo or something where the high pressure flow spins a shaft that helps pump raw seawater in on the intake side. I am not sure.\n\nIf you place the membrane at depth and then pump the freshwater up to the surface, you no longer have to pressurize the brine at all. You are just reducing the pressure on the freshwater side to create your gradient. You only have to pump the freshwater.\n\nThis greatly simplifies the energy recovery process and the brine disposal too.\n\nI am not sure this all works out in the real world. But the theory is not so terrible. I was super skeptical at first that it was all a swindle on the thermodynamic side. But after I thought about it more I realized it probably is not a swindle.",

        "body": "My impression and intuition was that unibody is \"stronger\" in the sense that the frame is stiffer and generally can handle higher loads in a variety of directions better than a frame at the same weight.\n\n\nThe reason many vehicles still use frames is for several reasons:\n\n\n1. Frames are easier to make in different lengths by simply increasing the lengths of the longitudinal members. This allows automakers to offer frame vehicles in a variety of sizes (i.e. short bed, long bed, basic cab, extended cab, crew cab, etc.) for a variety of customers. A unibody design would need a lot more work if they wanted to offer a stretched version, it would essentially be a completely new design. \n\n\n2. Frames are easier for a 3rd party to \"upfit\", i.e. the automaker can deliver a partial vehicle (cab + frame, think a pickup truck with the bed taken off) and the 3rd party can add a custom thing on to the bare rear section of frame (RV, box truck, small crane, work truck storage, etc). This can't really be done with a unibody vehicle, Toyota can't deliver an \"upfit ready\" Camry with the rear seat + trunk section cut off, the car wouldn't be structurally sound. I guess they *could*, but the design would need to be redone to allow that to happen. And the redone design would probably be making the back half of the Camry a flat frame, like a truck. \n\n\n3. The way that frames are less strong doesn't matter much for the tasks that framed vehicles are designed for. I.e. a pickup truck doesn't care too much about frame flex or bad handling, the critical metric is how much weight can be placed on the rear axle. The frame isn't being loaded that much between the axles, most of the weight is planted right over the rear axle, so frame strength isn't as critical. \n\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the purpose of trucks is to be good at carrying things and easy to load. Having minimal protrusions and obstructions in the area behind the cab increases the size of things that can be carried and makes them easier to load. Think of a flatbed, a big flat area behind the cab where anything can be loaded without having to worry about stuff getting in the way. \n\n\nUnibody vehicles are like a through-arch bridge, the floor is the deck, the roof + A pillar + last pillar are the arch, and the intermediate pillars are the bars suspending the deck. If you wanted to turn a unibody into something like a flat-bed truck, you couldn't. You would have to cut the roof and pillars behind the driver, which would compromise the \"arch\" and ruin the strength of the structure. If you cut away half an arch from a bridge, it will collapse.\n\n\nYes, if you made a frame vehicle with tall trusses like a bridge it would be stronger and lighter. But the trusses would protrude up into the cargo area, ruining the point of the truck. So instead they're constructed like a beam bridge. Look under the trailer of an 18 wheeler, especially the ones with really long flatbeds, you'll often see giant I-beams like a beam bridge, transferring the load between the wheels and the hitch.",

        "body": "Don't directly work with this, but a few things come to mind.\nThe primary purpose of an airbag is to prevent the head coming to a near instantaneous stop when it meets something solid with little to no give. The risk with such a rapid stop of the head is that the skull stops smartly, but the brains inside the skull don't. That means the brains crash into the skull.... and according to medical experts that's... *checks notes* ah, yes, that's bad.\n\nAirbags prevent this by having some give. The bag inflates with gas pressure, so you're head hits the bag, but as force is applied to the bag gas is released, allowing the head to continue moving forward, but since the release of gas is restricted it applies resistance, hence slowing the head gradually enough to not smash your brain into your skull too badly.\n\nIn the rear of the car there is nothing solid directly in front of the passengers. The back of the front seats is what you would hit, and those are typically relatively soft, and have enough give to provide gradual deceleration of the head rather than an instantaneous stop.\nIn other words, an airbag isn't really needed as the back of the seats provide a similar function. \n\nAnother reason I imagine is that if you just mounted airbags to the back of the front seats they'd actively exert a forward force on the front seat when they went off, throwing this in the front forward with more force. \nTo avoid this you'd need some sort of solid structure bolted to the frame which you could then mount the airbags too, this adds significant weight and cost, and actively puts solid things in the path of the rear passengers.",

We don't want to use it in cars or planes because it's tough to make it burn cleanly and modern engines have very tight tolerances and are designed to be as efficient as possible, which means they need a well-controlled fuel.

For context, I drive a concrete mixer, it has a 150 gallon water tank that sits shoulder height relative to the driver seat, and I will keep 40,000 pounds of wet concrete at high mix going down the road at highway speeds, only slowing slightly for the corners.

Something that leaves a slippery film that doesn't dry out or wear away is best. You just have to be careful that it doesn't run or spread contamination to the parts of the pen that need to flow ink, as oil or silicone based lubes will displace water based inks and prevent capillary or wetting action that allows them to flow where they need to.\n\ngraphite would be a good dry option but it is messy and you need to keep it contained with seals of some kind or it will leak out and turn your hands gray. \n\nI sometimes use the tiniest of drops of automotive/industrial gear lube on small metal/metal mechanisms. It can run out over time but its sticky enough to last a while. The downside is the sulfur content is very aromatic. \n\nA personal favorite I use in place of WD40 for things like hinges and mechanical hand tools is Ballistol. It's a gun oil / CLP fluid that is very friendly to metal, wood, and even skin. It's a bit fragrant but not in a universally unlikable way. I like the smell personally. \n\nWith any of these you probably need to be careful to ensure the lube is contained away from the ink flowing parts or the contamination may cause the pen to stop working. Without some kind of seal to prevent leakage from the business end, gravity is going to assist any fluid in spreading down to the tip. So your best bet is probably a sticky grease that stays where you put it.",

If you can't find a catalog listed part and rely on surplus or assortment lots or similar, you end up in the situation you're in.\n\nIf the ultimate per-spring cost is what matters, shop around for 1,000 pieces.  You'll probably pay the same as if you tried to just buy 250, but you'll have an extra 800 pieces when you're done.",

IOW, right when grid inertia is most-needed (high grid load) is when inverter-based generators can least provide it.\n\nIn order to ensure that inverter-based generators can always provide sufficient grid inertia would necessitate lightly loading them... which means building even more of them, which means even more cost, which means even higher retail electricity prices.\n\nOne way of getting around that for, for instance, wind and solar, is to have those power a motor-generator with similar spinning mass as a traditional power plant... if the sun goes behind a cloud bank or the wind stops blowing, the motor end of the motor-generator goes dead, and the generator end becomes a motor to draw just enough from the grid to keep the motor-generator set spinning until the power comes back to the motor end. Thus there are less-abrupt power (and thus frequency) perturbations which conventional spinning-mass generators can mitigate (unless there are simply too few grid-inertia-contributing power sources to keep the grid up, in which case you get the cascading trips as we saw in Spain, which exacerbates the frequency perturbation).",

If you were to put a new connection in totally out of phase it would blow up your new addition. If you are within a few degrees it will end up adapting to the frequency and phase of the grid quite quickly. Old school they measured this with a lightbulb between each of the output phases and the grid phase. Once the bulbs went dark you knew you were in phase. \n\nWith power electronics (like an inverter for a battery, wind farm, solar farm, etc) there is basically no rotating mass, and no inertia. That's what makes PE so cheap and efficient, you just switch electrons you don't bother spinning metal. The downside is that they don't really contribute to the stability of the grid, they rely on sensing the phase and then following it. \n\nAssuming you only had inverters and you tried to hook up a coal plant to it with a huge turbine, this would be hard. You would have to be *perfect*. Not to mention that on the scale of the grid even low frequency 60 Hz is beholden to the transmission line effects normally only seen at high bandwidth such as reflections and time delays. Accounting for all this is of course possible, but its hard and not normal operating procedure. \n\nIn short, you want a large spinning mass with lots of inertia you can start when the power is totally off for a black start, then you gradually add strategically placed plants in based on pre-determined locations and the architecture of the physical grid itself. Once these are synced up you then add smaller plants and inverters and the actual customers back in. \n\nThe best option for black start is generally hydropower.",

Sika AnchorFix is available at Home Depot.  Allow it to cure fully before installing the anchor plate, after you install the plate torque the nuts to 15 ft-lbs (no more).  If you over-torque the nuts it will break out a cone of concrete well before the epoxy fails.  That anchor system will hold a 2k winch no problem.",

It is required to carry out a safety assessment on the products. This has to consider all the hazards that can be identified and the measures taken to minimise the hazard. One potential hazard would be electric shock if someone opens it with the power on. You can minimise this risk by taking certain measures eg providing some internal shrouding for live parts, putting a warning label “do not open - no user-serviceable parts inside”, warnings in the documentation and security screws to prevent access. \n\nThe products we make ARE designed to be serviceable and we will supply spare parts, but I’m aware that this is not the norm these days and that it does perhaps expose us to a small additional risk of litigation.",

It’s there to respond to some unforeseen events which can challenge safety. These are usually enforced by laws or codes:standards. Usually you cannot design a product or system to encroach on these. \n\nThen there’s design margins. These are extra margins the designers put in for flexibility, to account for specific construction issues. Wear and aging over time. \n\nThere may be other margins beyond this like operational margin, administrative limits, etc\n\nSpeed limits are supposed to be set based on the average driving speed down a road. Roads are designed for safety under some maximum postulated limits. It’s possible for drivers over time to drive fast enough that speed limits rise over time, and possibly encroach on the designed limits. \n\nAdditionally the margins would be based on some postulated condition, like wet roads with worn standard tires. So you may have more margin on other days. \n\nBottom line, going 5 over is unlikely to result in a safety issue in most cases. If they did it down one of those very narrow Chicago streets with cars lined up on both sides and virtually no space, then he probably deserves a ticket because small kids get killed down those roads.

Using a chemical stage at the beginning is just a more complicated and expensive than adding a traditional refrigerant stage to the system. But you know what’s probably even cheaper than adding another stage; probably just oversizing the single stage system to account for humidity; which is what you currently have.\n\nThe exception would be if you have access to an unlimited free supply of charged desiccant.",

If it is genuinely that humid, the only thing you can do is to increase cooling surface area - a dry coil seems like it'd just be simpler if you aren't getting sufficient cooling.\n\nAlternatively, if you are dead set on dessicant, it may be more advatageous to install dessicant based dehumidification wheels on the air handlers, which may actually reduce the cooling demand on the chillers.  That is assuming there is enough heat generation in the facility for the exhaust air to be warm enough to dry the regenerating side of the wheel.",

I tried using stepper motors with a cam attachment, but it was always difficult to get it to consistently stop at the right position, and have it apply enough force to hit the button. When I changed to using a solenoid it worked a lot better, once I got it dialed in it would easily press the button every time. So, my guess is it’s the same for pinball machines. They need a reliable way to apply a lot of force to the flipper very quickly, solenoids do that very easily and reliably. ",

        "body": "There is both science and some art in picking the right set of props for high speed running and it’s much more complicated than just calculating slip.  It’s flying a boat on the surface of the water.  \n\nMercury Racing is the standard power for going fast on the water.  You say 1000hp, but that’s twin 500Rs on a catamaran running 135mph on a pleasure boat.  Or 170mph with twin QC4 1550hp twin turbo engines in an offshore catamaran.  They have a phone app for calculating prop slip, which account side engine RPM, boat speed, gear ratio, and prop pitch (pitch is how many turns it takes to go forward X inches, think screw pitch).  It’s gives you an idea of efficiency with the slip number, which is typically 10% depending on application and prop type.  \n\nCavitation or aeration of the propeller mostly only occurs during the transition from idle to on plane for the hull.  Since most boat drives are a single gear, it can be advantageous to cavitate the prop, spin up RPM to where the engine makes more power and that helps propel the boat up on top of the water.  Massively inneficient, but occurs for a short duration of time.  \n\nThen you want to go fast.  First you need to select a pitch that will propel you that fast.  Let’s say a 36 pitch, on a 1.6 ratio gearcase with an engine that spins 6600rpm.  That should be good for 140mph, but you have to account for slip.  Slip is a combination of propeller efficiency (how well it cuts through the water, skin drag, cavitation effects), how loaded each blade is for each blade pass event, how efficient the boat hull is, and how aerated the water is.   The boat is flying on top of the water, so at most there is 1.5 blades in the water on each gearcase at any point in time.  Slip is all of that combined and is around 10% on average.  So now you’re down to 126mph.  \n\nAnd now you adjust diameter, rake, progression, blade thickness, hub diameter and length.  And gearcase rotation and height.  You can go up in diameter so that each blade pass gets cleaner water, lowering slip, but even 1/4” change can lift the back of the boat.  So you can adjust rake (think firehose spray, being wide or narrow).  A larger rake angle can help reduce lift, but tends to paddle wheel sideways causing handling issues.  You can drop gearcase height and leave diameter alone, but then the boat skis on the gear cases and slip goes up.  Thinner blades are more efficient, but durability from fatigue becomes more of an issue, and the flexing of the blade during running means an error between cut pitch and running pitch.  \n\nAnd then you have inboard vs outboard rotation of the gear cases.  Inboard rotation pulls the back of the boat down, but is advantageous for turning and can help settle a prop that would otherwise lift the back of the boat.   Or outboard rotation, which lifts the rear of the boat, but helps stabilize rolling side to side.  \n\nWhen you balance all of that, plus boat CG, center of lift pressure, aerating strakes, and keeping cooling water to the engines, you can hit records AND stay in one piece doing it.",

Yes, they tended to fail along weld seams and sharp corners in the hull (stress concentration points), but not as much due to the shape as due to the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) of the blend of steel they were made from.  Feel free to Google it, but the short version is that steel can become brittle at colder temperatures, and more prone to cracking versus flexing.\n\nRound windows were mainly adopted from a problem in airframes, not ships - as you can see there are plenty of modern ships about still with square windows. When aircraft transitioned to aluminum fuselages - which has a finite fatigue limit under any stress, unlike steel - the stress concentration points became a point of concern over relatively few pressurization cycles at altitude compered to round windows.\n\nIf you want to remain sane, maybe don't look up the regs on commercial airframes.",

Decompression chambers for deep-diving and caisson work are now a standard thing in workplaces that can cause blood gas injuries.",

You print a mask on a normal printer, overlay the mask on the blank and expose it to UV light (the sun works fine). The areas behind the black parts of the mask stay hard while the bits the UV can get to go soft (or possibly the other way round). Now you stick the PCB blank into the first part of the triple tank, and dissolve away the soft bits of the surface layer, exposing the copper underneath. Next you move the PCB to the second part of the tank, which etches away the exposed copper. Finally you strip off the remaining surface layer leaving you with a finished PCB.\n\nThe triple tank is basically just a series of buckets full of chemicals, and you don’t even really need a printer to make the mask: you could make one by hand with black paper and scissors. The whole process is incredibly low tech.\n\nA photolithography machine for making integrated circuits is basically just the same thing but working at a smaller scale. We use the ability to focus light to project the image of a large mask onto a small die (the “blank” that will become the chip), and there is both etching and deposition.\n\nSo basically we got to the incredibly precise, complex machines that you see today incrementally, starting from some really basic principles from the dawn of photography using buckets of chemicals.",

Existing manufacturing processes involved placing specially shaped globs of wax on certain portions of the semiconductor material, then washing away the uncovered portions using specialized chemicals. Making smaller transistors required smaller globs of wax, but keeping these globs in the correct shape proved challenging.\nWhile looking through a microscope at one of their transistors, Lathrop and his assistant, chemist James Nall, had an idea: a microscope lens could take something small and make it look bigger. If they turned the microscope upside down, its lens would take something big and make it look smaller. Could they use a lens to take a big pattern and “print” it onto germanium, thereby making miniature mesas on their blocks of germanium? Kodak, the camera company, sold chemicals called photoresists, which reacted when exposed to light.\nLathrop covered a block of germanium with one of Kodak’s photoresist chemicals that would disappear if exposed to light. Next, he turned his microscope upside down, covering the lens with a pattern so that light would only pass through a rectangle-shaped area. Light entered the pattern, shined in a rectangle shape through the lens, and was shrunk in size by the upside-down microscope as it focused onto the photoresist-coated germanium, with the rays of light creating a perfectly shaped, miniature version of the rectangular pattern. Where light struck the layer of photoresist, the chemical structure was altered, allowing it to be washed away, leaving a tiny rectangular hole, far smaller and more accurately shaped than any glob of wax.”\n\nAs others have said, there is a huge chain of innovations either side of this critical moment. I think some of the basic tech on photoresists derived from screen printing — the mass market poster industry developed before World War II and made famous by Andy Warhol’s screen prints, at about the same time that Fairchild were using similar techniques to build the first mass produced integrated circuits.",

Its not going to tell you immediately if you need special processing when the alloy itself is created. You can figure all that stuff out through various methods, but it isn't nearly as simple as \"just make a copy\" especially on something as complex as a jet aircraft. Look at the compressor blades on jet engines. Some of the most advanced ones are not just made from a particular alloy, they're made from single flawless crystals of that particular alloy (this is just an example, I don't know how the spread of that particular technology happened.) Before that process was widely known, figuring something like that out would have been non-trivial and then developing that capability would present a further roadblock. \n\nAlso, having one example of something tells you nothing about tolerances and things like that. When you measure the dimensions of a single example of a part, that doesn't tell you the nominal design dimension of that part and how much variance is allowable. It only tells you the dimensions of that specific part. Again, you can figure it out, but it isn't as simple as just making a copy.\n\nOn top of all that, why would Soviets build an exact copy of the F-14? They have their own designers. They make their own planes that meet their own needs. It is certainly possible that there were characteristics of the F-14 that they simply couldn't replicate, but to a large extent, they design based on their own needs using their own philosophy and so that the plane that they design can be built within their industrial system. As far as helping Iran make parts for their F-14's... I'm gonna guess that the Soviets would much rather sell Iran one of their own export fighters instead of supporting American ones.\n\nReverse engineering electronics like those used in fighter aircraft are a whole other ball of wax. Manufacturing all of the electronic components to the appropriate specifications is not easy and nowadays, even the technology used to create certain things are export controlled.\n\nI feel like your friend doesn't know very much about engineering at all...

Yes, having a working example or, ideally, several would make the job much easier. \n\nOne of the only examples I can think of where this was done was when the Soviets built an unlicensed copy of the B-29 during WWII. The B-29 itself was extremely advanced and enormously expensive, costing more than the Manhattan project to develop. It was a tremendous force multiplier and was the ideal delivery platform for nuclear weapons. \n\nThe US refused to sell the Soviets any examples, but some US bomber crews were forced to land in Russian territory after bombing Japan. The Soviets refused to give the aircraft back and began the process of reverse engineering them. \n\nThey kept a couple intact for reference and took one completely apart, measuring and drawing every little bit of it. They already had their own engine, which was equivalent to what was on the B-29, so they were able to use that. \n\nEverything had to be converted to metric. Off the shelf parts had to either be put into production or substituted with local equivalents. The end result was close to a carbon copy of what was at the time the most advanced warplane in the world. \n\nThe Russians could have done the same for the F-14. But there are good reasons not to. Firstly, national pride. It's embarrassing for a country to copy their adversary's technology exactly, and it would make IFF during any hot war more confusing. \n\nSecondly, the F-14 was designed for the role of fleet defense, which was of little value to the Soviets who lacked serious aircraft carriers and weren't planning on projecting force with their fleet in the same way.\n\nFinally, the great technological edge possessed by the F-14 was not the aircraft, but the avionics and weapons. The computers in the B-29 were electromechanical, but the F-14 ran advanced digital computers. It's very hard to copy a microprocessor just by looking at it, and so a reverse engineered F-14 would require the Soviets to develop its avionics suite from scratch, at which point they might as well install it in their own aircraft, or install what they already had, at which point it would be little better than what they were already flying.",

Sometimes I can make them and sometimes I can’t. If someone asked me to reverse engineer a fighter jet for their own use, I’d refuse, even if I had the jet in my possession. \n\nWhy you ask? Because there are so many factors that go into designing parts, machinery, and systems that it’s unlikely you’d make it right. And if a jet isn’t made right, people get hurt more than just a couple of cuts and scrapes. Metal types, crystalline structures, weld protocol, tolerances, even basic principals that are factored into the design that aren’t mentioned, over engineered sections, under engineered sections, one missed detailed can cost millions of dollars and get someone hurt even in the testing phase. This is why when someone reverse engineers something, it’s usually a small component of a bigger system.

In the case of Iran, they have plenty of very good engineers, but they don't have the technology to successfully copy the F-14 engines. \n\nSource: I spent 20 years in aircraft parts manufacturing. My company had parts counterfeited and sold and installed on aircraft. How did we find out? The parts failed and we got bitched out and sued by the airlines. It took the FAA investigators about 10 minutes to determine that the parts were counterfeited, then another 15 minutes to track down the airline's purchasing records and then another 15 minutes to shut down the airline's quality system and ground the fleet. But I digress.\n\nReverse engineering from parts in hand does NOT reveal metallurgy, heat treatments, and other processes that make the part what it is. It would take Iran a highly sophisticated aerospace industry to make reasonable (but not equal) copies of an F-14.\n\nOn the other hand, the Russians and Chinese DO have the industries and the intelligence (spies) to get pretty close. So they might know, but still can't duplicate the more exotic processes.

This is completely wrong. They are independent.\n\nThe material property that pertains to deflection under load is modulus of elasticity. People might call this strength when speaking informally. But it is definitely not the same thing as tensile strength.\n\nI'm an electrical engineer not a structural engineer. Also I didn't read your whole thing because it is long. But this jumped out at me.\n\nI would suggest that you keep things simple. Rectangular beam or I-beam.\n\nOh, also, 370 lbs per foot seems like a lot. I am accustomed to hearing numbers like 40 lbs per square foot loading. If you have joists every 12 inches, then 40 lbs per square foot ends up being 40 lbs per linear foot on each joist. If you see what I mean.\n\nSo make sure your 370 lb number makes sense.\n\nI apologize for not reading the whole thing.\n\nThe basics of mechanical design are to calculate the maximum stress (units will be in PSI or MPa). Then decide on a safety factor. Then you select the correct yield strength (also in PSI or MPa) for the material (yield, not ultimate strength). Now, you want to insure that stress \\* safety factor <= yield strength. This tells you if the material is strong enough so that it will not fail.\n\nThen you have to examine the stiffness. Modulus of elasticity will come into this, and then you can use some of your relationships about depth of beam and length of span and so-on. There are also span tables you can look up. These are based on maximum allowable deflection also.",

Get a square metal tube about 30 mm square and cut 30 mm off of it, so you have a 30 mm cube with two open sides.  Drill clearance holes for your threaded rods through two opposite closed sides.  Put a nylock nut on each rod, threaded past the end far enough to leave room for another nylock nut and a little to spare. Put each rod through its hole and put another nylock nut over the end of the rod inside the little cube.  Tighten until you find the compromise between jiggle and friction that you want.

I guess a steel can inside of an aluminum tube could help strengthen the magnetic field and increase the induction effect, and it's possible that you'd have enough print that it would work with just a steel can.  But the classic demo of this uses an aluminum can. \n\nAs far as troubleshooting, the easiest thing to do would be to crank up the voltage, with an aluminum can installed, and see if you can get it to go.  But if you do that, first, put in a higher voltage capacitor.  Also, a film cap will have lowered ESR and that might help.  The capacitor voltage can actually be higher than the supply voltage if you got a resonance. You would want to monitor the temperature of your coils and make sure they aren't getting too hot.  You might also overheat your variac but perhaps it has a fuse that protects you from drawing much more current than you should?  You could monitor that output current from the very act with a meter to stay in a safe range, or install your own fuse if it doesn't have one on the output.\n\nBeyond that brute force approach, you would want to be able to measure the voltages across the two windings on an oscilloscope and compare their phase to see whether the capacitor value you have is remotely helpful.  Without an oscilloscope, you might be able to measure multiple voltages and triangulate to figure out what's going on with the phasor voltages.",

That is given the position and yaw angle of a chassis where are the 4 points (or more) that define the limits of the body , pretty much a one liner.\n\nIn more detail the paths of the 4 wheels do not necessarily sit on concentric circles with a difference in radius equal to the track.

Just get an “O-ring Boss” fitting and it will work.  I’ll let you in on another secret that has saved my bacon many times - a 37 degree AN/JIC fitting will usually fit the port.  The flare edge doesn’t do anything in this instance, it’s just adding extra length so the port needs to be deep enough so it doesn’t bottom out.  Usually it is.  Also the hex of the fitting needs to be big enough to fully support the O-ring.

They are also not inherently UV resistant, so you will want one with a UV stabilizer mixed in or applied as a coating. \n\nI might consider a mult-material sandwich, with each layer serving a different function. The top might be a thin metal mesh, to resist abrasion. The next might be plastic, to admit light. And under it might be aluminum or wood ribs to ensure children won't fall through. Even if the plastic is strong enough, it might not be STIFF enough, so it might flex enough that it pops out of the frame. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that plastic tends to have a larger thermal expansion coefficient than usual materials like glass, i.e., it expands and contracts much more with changes in temperature. For polycarbonate, the linear TEC is ten times larger than for glass. So the frame has to be built to handle that, maybe with deeper lips to support the plastic even when it's shrunken down from cold, also with screw holes that are actually slots so the plastic won't crack. That's often done with wood construction in furniture, incidentally.  \n\nAll of that is hard to be specific about, because we don't know the size of your window, how the frame is made, etc. \n\nAnother thing to consider is the weight of the thing. It's no good to have a cover that's strong enough but people can't lift it, especially the kids. You may need a gas-assist cylinder or something. \n\nHome Depot offers a product called Twinwall, which is a double-wall sheet where the walls are separated by ribs. The stuff is UV resistant and light for its strength. Obviously it's stronger in one direction than the other, like corrugated cardboard, so you might consider using two layers, with the ribs oriented at right angles. And again, maybe a reinforcing rib or two attached underneath. \n\nAnd this entire discussion might be rendered moot by building codes. Maybe you know an inspector won't come around so you might want to just wing it, but I think it's smart to make sure you're following code. You can imagine a kid falling through the window, and the parents suing you, and saying the cover wasn't built to code, etc. That would be bad. \n\nGood luck!",

It'll magnet itself to the inner door if they're just that thickness apart when closed, it'll probably have plenty of magnetic force to pull the inner door open, and it'll slide on the face if the inner door when opening. Closing will require some force.\n\nAlternatively, pantograph it. Add hinge pin to the top of the fridge door and bolt a bracket with a hinge pin to the outer door and attach the two pins with a solid member that hinges on them. This will allow an arbitrary gap between the doors when closed.\n\nIf the gap is near zero, you could also make your own sliders with thin sheet metal. Fixed to each door and overlapping like a french-cleat but thin. Or a wide band on one that's fixed top and bottom and a thin band on the other that's fixed on either end, like a belt loop and a belt.\n\nThe pantograph is probably the easiest to make look non-janky and operate smoothly.\n\nEdit: Thinking some more, the complication with the pantograph is that the hinge pins on the swinging end have to align with the hinge pins on the hinged ends of the doors, to make it a proper rhombus and work correctly. Since the outer door hinge is on its outer face, the strap would have to penetrate the door and be attached to a hinge pin at the outer face. Not great for looks.\n\nSo maybe instead of a hinge you want a slider bracket top and bottom. The bracket is just a long piece of metal sticking out sideways from the outer door and almost resting on the top/bottom of the inner door, and the inner door has a pin in the top/bottom that fits in the slot and slides as the doors move.",

        "body": "Differentials are \"dumber\" devices than you think. A standard open differential works by applying torque to a single ring gear, which is connected through spider gears to each output shaft. It works exactly the same as putting a stick across a doorframe and pushing in the middle. Both sides have to get the same force. If one side of the door frame suddenly gave way, the other side would get no force because the stick would just swing through. There's a great video from the ~1930s explaining on YouTube.\n\n\nThere are a ton of variations on this theme to achieve better performance, but the most basic limited slip designs just have a viscous coupler or a clutch pack with some type of actuation mechanism - maybe an oil pump that's connected so that it turns at the difference of the output shaft speeds. You set up the coupler or clutch so that when the speed difference gets to be more than what you expect from normal turning, it locks the output shafts together. Since the device is designed not to intervene an small slip speeds, it will release when it gets back to the \"normal\" expected slip, they never actually lock, but regulate at some kind of balance. It's a lossy process. More mechanical complications let you tune acceleration and deceleration differently, and it's all tuned either experimentally or based on experience gained from past experiments.\n\n\nSo anyway, open differentials are always 50/50, with the lower-grip wheel setting the limit for what you can apply to the higher grip wheel. Lockers are NOT 50/50 unless the ground is perfectly flat and smooth, you never turn at all, and your tires are exactly the same size (they aren't). A locker splits the torque to whatever it takes to make the speeds the same, even if it's 10,000/-10,000, which is part of why 4x4s mangle drivetrain components. An LSD will gradually shift more torque to the slower wheel as the difference between the two wheels gets larger.",

They work by having both wheels \"push\" on either side of a gear. As long as both have similar torque, that gear locks up and allows both to spin together. If one wheel has significantly less grip, the gear can spin freely, and no torque can be transmitted to the one with traction.\n\nLocked or lockable differentials bind both wheels together, forcing them to spin at the same speed no matter what. This is good for traction, but can harm the components because it's very easy to overload them, as any difference in torque needs to be absorbed by the transmission. Which is why you're only supposed to lock them to get out of a bind and then open them again.\n\nLimited Slip Diffs... there are as many types as there are transmission engineers with a R&D budget. Some of them use electronic signals to lock them up after a certain amount of slip. Some use clutches that engage based on speed differential between the input and one or both input shafts. Some use a viscous fluid that allows some slip, but eventually forces torque on both axles (somewhat similar to what old-school automatic transmissions do). Some use a complex arrangement of gears with some movement to induce friction in the system when there's slip. Some use a gerotor pump, which causes fluid to be pumped when there's relative motion between the axles into a clutch pack.",

But that depends on the exact type of wood you're getting: you need to confirm with the lumber mill on what you're getting.\n\nThat out of the way, you need an engineer and permits for this. Because you can build a bridge with less strong (and cheaper) wood for what you need - you don't need to account for say fully loaded highway freight traffic if you're doing a small lawn tractor as a worst case loading scenario. And as others have mentioned: you also need to account for drainage/erosion impacts of what you're doing.\n\nedit- also geotechnical analysis to see what kind of existing soil you have to determine the foundation/footings of what you're planning. A good, locally licensed construction engineer would be my suggestion as this project requires geotechnical, hydraulics, and structural components; and a construction engineer is a jack-of-all-trades that can cover those.",

There are online charts and values you can use that are empirically determined. From pressure loss and any height difference from pond to sprinkler you can find the total head required at the pump. Then you can use flow rate and pump curves to see what pump you'd need. Start with the items that are fixed, i.e. you have picked your sprinklers, they have set values that can't be changed, tube lengths are relatively fixed, but tube size can be upsized to reduce pressure loss. This is something I covered in my last year of studies so it's not the most basic problem to solve, you'll likely need to do multiple iterations, or hire someone with experience to solve it for you.\n\nEdit: 5800 L/h is quite a lot of water (~26 gpm) so I'm not surprised you're getting larger results, quick google search finds that most households only require half of that or less.",

It's not solid engineering but if you're running garden hose and extension cords for under $200 you can figure out your path. I would just temper your expectations on flow rate.

But you asked two different questions that are related but different. \n\n1) can you use something to power hotel loads from the primaries?\n\n2) how to deal with transient power spikes. \n\n1) absolutely. The easiest option is a shaft generator. Basically just an oversized alternator that attaches to the drive shaft. \n\nThey also generally have the option of allowing power to fed back to the shaft if you want. This is nice when you have large house gens and sometimes can get away without powering up the mains. \n\n2) actually flywheels on board are VERY tricky. The torque they generate while operating is enough to impact the stability of the ship (see gyro stabilization). The other issue is that flywheels really don’t like 6DOF motion. So you need to make very sure the flywheel can handle the accelerations on board. \n\nWhat we actually use are large batteries that act as peak shaving systems. Basically the batteries charge when excess power is available and releases it when there is a draw. We have systems that routinely absorb 1MW transient spikes with no noticeable impact on engine speed. \n\nIf you pair the shaft gen with the batteries you also get a limited all electric power solution for free. On a recent vessel we got about 8 hours of electric propulsion at 8kn for free once the batteries were sized for peak shaving.",

Instead, it is primarily concerned with ensuring accurate airflow and pressure measurements by controlling upstream and downstream conditions, such as the use of flow straighteners, proper nozzle placement, and settling chambers, while leaving the sizing of the outlet or exhaust flexible. In general design practice, it is recommended that the exhaust diameter be at least equal to, or larger than, the fan discharge diameter. This helps to prevent backpressure that could negatively impact the fan’s performance. Additionally, incorporating a smooth, gradual transition (such as a diffuser) to a larger exhaust can help maintain uniform airflow and reduce losses.\n\nThe reason the standard does not specify an exhaust diameter is to allow for flexibility in different test setups, such as chamber-nozzle, chamber-duct-nozzle, or chamber-nozzle-duct configurations. The focus remains on the test setup’s ability to measure flow and pressure accurately, rather than mandating specific duct dimensions—unless those dimensions would affect measurement accuracy.\n\nI recommend making the exhaust duct at least the same size as the fan’s outlet, and ideally 20–50% larger if space permits. Using a short transition, such as a diffuser or flared exit,, to the atmosphere can also help minimize flow reflections and pressure artifacts.",

Gear ratio and torque is the same as if you only had gear A meshing with C directly, minus a little bit of frictional losses.\n\nIn order to have compound gear ratio of multiple gear sets, we need at least four gears on three axles.\n\nLet's say we have input gear A with 25 teeth, driving gear B which has 50 teeth. That's a 1:2 gear ratio, so A turns twice per rotation of B and the torque is doubled (minus friction loss).\n\nB is mounted to an intermediary axle together with gear C, such that B and C must turn together. \n\nIf C has 25 teeth, and drives output gear D which has 50 teeth, then we again get a 1:2 ratio so the torque from C to D is doubled again.\n\nThe combined gear ratio of both gear pairs then becomes 1:4, so four revolutions of gear A makes one revolution of gear D. With torque being quadrupled across the whole gear train, again minus some small amount of frictional loss.\n\nWe could achieve exactly the same thing with just two gears, if A was 25 teeth and B 100. But sometimes you cannot have a gear that large in diameter, for various reasons, and so compounding two or more gear pairs makes sense.\n\nIn theory you could keep adding gear pairs to further multiply torque and reduce speed. But you rather quickly run into material strength limitations, where everything needs to be substantially scaled up in order to not break under such immense torque. And with extremely low gear ratios you can get problems with backlash- each gear and each bearing has a tiny bit of clearance to allow for smooth movement, and this all adds up over a complex gear train.\n\nThere's some neat videos on YouTube of Lego Technic gear trains with extreme compound ratios, where the theoretical gear ratio is such that the motor spinning the input shaft could keep going for years to make one revolution of the output shaft. In practice, friction and torque combined with the low strength of plastic parts means something will eventually break rather than rotate.",

If you have them arrayed differently you will have different spacing (duh).\n\nA note on US national pipe sizes if you are not familiar.  It is not the outside diameter.  Nominal 1 1/2” schedule 40 pipe is 1.9” OD. That’s bigger than you probably want to grab and do pull ups on.  All 1.5” pipes are the same OD, this allows you to use the same fitting with different wall thickness pipes. \n\nYou can also get it in schedule 80 and 120, with a wall thickness of 0.145” for schedule 40, 0.2” for schedule 80, and 0.4” for the schedule 120.  Remember, the OD of the pipe does not change, the inside diameter does.  Depending upon your span, and what you’re doing with it, it could be strong enough or not. \n\nIf you want to specify the Outside Diameter, either use tube or a chart like this: https://usaindustries.com/piping-isolation-testing-products/pipe-schedule-chart/",

        "body": "Quick and dirty (and your husband should be able to follow with an ME degree). Fyi I am not a PE or structural engineer. This is basically my 2cents as an anonymous redditor. \n\n\nIf you consider the 6ft length section as cantilever (unsupported at one end, fixed at the other) the equation for maximum stress is force X length squared X Moment of intertia for the beam. Note that the force supported is the weight of the kids, net (probably negligible) and weight of the beams. \n\n\nYour obviously not cantilevering the beams but it's a weak method of support and therefore ensures some safety if designed that way.  the supporting logs on the right end would be in tension which would have a significantly higher strength that way. The cross beams stabilizing the net at the right would also be a short span and therefore able to handle a high load so Im only looking for the 6ft segment to be strong enough. \n\n\nA 5in beam has a moment of inertia of 30.6in4. your length is 36in (6ft/2). If you make this out of White pine, your maximum tensile strength would be 8600lb/in 2. Therefore at 6ft, your maximum load in the middle is around 200lbs for each beam, you have two so 400lbs. \n\n\nThis has zero factor of safety included and it's possible you have weak wood, dynamic loading, or bad connections that make this worse. A common safety factor is 4, which means you can only support 1 kid (~100lb) at a time. If they bounce or jump, it could be enough to bring it down.\n\n\nIf you installed two additional beams to support the middle of the 6ft span, you length is cut in half again (18in) and your load goes to 1624lbs.  With a safety factor of 4 you could reasonably support 3 kids ~150lbs. \n\n\n\n\nSo my recommendations -\n1) the 4ft tall beams should sit under the end of the 6ft long beam to better support the long run. \n\n\n2) a beam or two should be placed under the middle of the 6ft span and that should significantly increase the load capacity across the beam. (Fyi I am assuming your net will be fastened to the 6ft beam in multiple places). \n\n\n3) beams of 5in diameter and decent quality pine or stronger material are needed. \n\n\n4) use strong fasters (lag bolts for example) in multiple locations to maximize joint stiffness. \n\n\n5) keep the net a foot or two off the ground maximum. If there isn't much distance to fall, it's not really significant if something fails. \n\n\n6) the 4ft beams at the right end will have the top pulled into the middle when kids are bouncing/crawling in the net. You need to use 5ft or 6ft long beams on that end and bury them into the ground for a good foundation. ",

If it's a bike, probably still take my advice, but you probably won't die. \n\nIf you wanted to properly evaluate this.\n\nWhat is the tensile strength of the stock bolt?\nWhat is the tensile strength of the proposed bolt?\nIf the new bolt is weaker, you have dimished factor of safety to bolt snap. \n\nIs the modulus of elasticity the same? If it's higher, then you get less stretch which is less factor of safety against loosening. Unless you increase torque to account for it, but you need to verify the threads are strong enough for more torque. \n\nAny 300 series stainless has a drastically higher CTE than normal carbon or alloy steel bolts. 316, 304, 309, etc. Doesn't matter. All non-austenetic stainless is  ~16E-6 mm/mm*K. Carbon steel or austenetic stainless (400 series) is closer to 10E-6. So 300 series as it heats up, it gets looser faster than carbon steel. You usually need to fight this with higher torque (for more stretch), or a longer grip (for more stretch). So, as a bolt heat cycles, you lose preload at temp, and it can work loose over time. \n\n300 series is gummy. It has a high tendency to gall. Aluminum is also gummy, and has a high tendency to gall. 300 series + aluminum threads nasty, I would not recommend that.\n\nThread lubricant won't make your bolt fall out. It reduces friction, but that makes the bolt have more pre-load for the same torque. This makes you more likely to snap the bolt, strip threads, or just over tighten the joint. Loosening isnt the increased risk there.",

The voltage from top to bottom on the inductor is positive, because of the input polarity, so the slope of the current is positive (it grows, growing the magnetic field).\n\nIn the second part of the cycle the input is switched out and the output is switched in and the inductor discharges its current there. The voltage from top to bottom on the inductor is now negative, because of the direction the current is flowing through the load, so the slope of the current is negative (it decreases as the magnetic field is depleted).\n\nRemember that the current is always flowing the same way through this inductor, in both parts of the cycle.\n\nThe lengths of these two intervals does not need to be the same. But when you integrate the first part (positive voltage over time) and the second part (negative voltage over time), you should end up with 0.\n\nThis must be true in steady state, but, it's possible to be true in some unsteady state if the input voltage or load are changing for some reason and the integrals on the two parts of the cycle just happen to work out to 0.\n\nAlso, as u/mckenzie_keith points out, the inductor has a small resistance, and the current always flowing the same way through that resistance will always have a positive voltage on it that will integrate to nonzero in any given cycle, and will cause real-world measurements on such an inductor to be slightly skewed upward, but that's an inefficiency rather than failure of the steady state.",

The inductor will still have a switching waveform, but the duty cycle will be fixed and invariant. The volt-second balance will apply in this case.\n\nIt may not quite be correct to say that the average voltage is zero. If it were an ideal inductor that would be true, but for real inductors, there is an effective series resistance (ESR) in the inductor. The average voltage drop across this ESR will not be zero unless the average current is also zero.\n\nNot trying to confuse you with the ESR thing. If you don't get what I am saying, just ignore the whole thing about ESR for now and circle back later.\n\nThe math explanation (not quite calculus) is that V = L (di/dt). This means that di/dt = V/L. If you have positive voltage, the current will ramp in the positive direction. If you nave negative voltage, the current will ramp in the negative direction. If the positive and negative ramping do not balance out over time, then the current will ramp to a large magnitude and saturate the inductor, and everything will go \"off the rails.\"",

Maybe DOWSIL 791 would be a better choice. It is marketed as a weather seal rather than a glazing adhesive.\n\nVHB tape will also work. (very high bond strength tape). VHB will probably be easier to remove than silicon adhesives.\n\nOne way to remove VHB, you drag a fine wire through the gap in the glass. As you pull the wire through the tape, you can separate the two panes of glass. I would not call it easy exactly, but you can definitely do it, with patience. Heat may help also, but don't break the glass.\n\nResidue can be removed with acetone or high purity isopropyl alcohol (90 percent or higher).\n\nThere are a variety of VHB tapes with different thicknesses and strengths. You may be able to find one that is suitable and that can be pealed off without solvents and without residue.",

I personally live in the apartment where there's a bunch of thin-ass drywall and insulation between me and my neighbors and they managed to go through it when doing renovations and it's not a large apartment that was split later, that's how it was designed\n\nIt's even easier with a skyscraper that doesn't have any load-bearing walls\n\nRegulation-wise, YMMV",

In this case yes you almost certainly could remove the vast majority of the interior walls without affecting the structural integrity of the building. Note that there are likely utilities (power, water, waste, etc ) running through various vertical and horizontal corridors so those would need to be walled off or relocated.\n* If the building is smaller, it is almost certainly stick built so some of the walls are load bearing. I'd hazard a guess that more often than not the walls between units will be load bearing rather than walls internal to one unit, but there will be tons of exceptions\n* Even if a wall is load bearing, you can usually replace that with a sturdy header to make at least a doorway through the wall. So if you're okay with just doorways between units then yes in most cases it can be done without too much effort.\n* If the walls are concrete then I don't know.",

This is **high-level**, **project-based**, and **forward-looking**.\n\nIf you want more detailed forward modeling, you have to do the work of characterizing your typical project and that comes from actually using planning tools. Once you have firm projects with similarly firm schedules, it is relatively simple. You should have float in the schedule and some level of conservatism in the durations so that when unanticipated work comes up, it doesn't push out your entire schedule (this is typical project management stuff.) Maintaining the schedule is a huge part of managing the project. I would be willing to bet that they would be more willing to do it if they were using a real project management tool rather than putting it into your homegrown system. If they don't want to do it at all... you need different project managers (a project I've also dealt with.)\n\nOnce you have historical data for these projects, you use the actual schedule data to make your schedules better to begin with. You can also use this historical data to create a generic project formula that you can use for medium term planning (projects that you have won or expect to win, but haven't scheduled). For planning that goes out past your backlog you can probably pretty effectively use modeling that scales based on revenue and project type mix depending on your specific application.\n\nLots of companies just do this kind of long term planning based on vibes, but if you want to do it effectively, you need to start building up your historical data by actually using scheduling software with real capabilities.\n\nThere was a time where I let myself get roped into projects where my company was trying to get us to develop a cheap version of software that is available on the open market. It is a bad idea. They should be buying existing software and only filling in gaps with in house development.",

        "body": "TLDR: Environmental engineer with 5ish years of experience. Consulting job is becoming unbearably stressful, considering leaving the industry. Any less stressful (likely lower paying) engineering adjacent jobs that I could easily transition to?\n\nStarting to feel like I’ve made the wrong career choice and looking for some advice. \n\nFor some background, I got my degree in environmental engineering about 5 years ago and have been working ever since. My first year and a half I was at a construction materials testing firm and for the past 3.5 years I’ve been at a pretty large private consulting firm that primarily works in the solid waste industry. Living in a smaller northeast city, and currently making about $85,000 in my role (salaried, no OT). No PE at this point, but I am eligible to take it.\n\nWork has had me in a fight or flight mode of existence for the past several months. All I can ever think about is work and I often times am working evenings and weekends to keep up with workload demands. It’s becoming too much to handle mentally and I’m considering a change. I’m having a really hard time deciding where I want to go from here, as I am not sure i want to stick with engineering.\n\nPart of this is because the experience I’ve gotten at my current job isn’t even really engineering related. I somehow got plugged into this small team (of non-engineers) that work on a lot more qualitative and policy planning focused (think solid waste management / zero waste plans for municipalities / counties). The work we do is considered an emerging initiative for the company so there’s a lot of pressure for us to grow and perform. While these projects can be interesting and look at complex issues, I don’t have a background in policy planning so I’m left feeling lost a lot of the time. Senior leadership on the team also has no idea what they’re doing or how to solve the problems we get hired to solve. This kind of leaves me at the brunt of things, trying to create deliverables with little to no direction. \n\nGiven the types of projects Ive been pigeon holed into, I kind of feel behind many of my industry peers. I haven’t been able to develop the technical skillset that I feel like I need to be an engineer. I have very little experience working on projects developing engineering drawings or technical specifications, which I feel are probably important skills that I’m missing. I feel like I have 5 years of experience with nothing to show for it, so I fear I can’t just transition to another company because they’ll expect I have these skills as someone with 5 years experience. Almost feel like I need to start as an entry level again.\n\nI also don’t even know if I want to continue on the road of becoming an engineer. I look at the PEs at the company I work now and I don’t want to be anything like them. Their entire life seems to be work. Most if not all are putting in hours and hours of unpaid overtime every week. I fucking hate corporate culture, dealing with projects that are under budgeted, and not being billable enough. I’m so tired of it. I also have an OCD diagnosis which makes it really difficult for me to not obsess over the stresses of an already stressful career. Lastly, the communication skills required to be a successful engineer don’t come easily to me. While I can do it, presenting at conferences, running meetings, communicating with clients, is super difficult for me and requires a lot more preparation as compared to a more extroverted person. \n\nI guess this is all to say I don’t think I can stay at my current job and I’m even considering leaving the industry all together because I’m fearful that whatever job I get next will be more of the same problems. I’m wondering if there are any engineering adjacent fields that I could easily transition into that are less stressful.

Last year, I did a civil engineering internship (general site surveying, planning, etc). I'm now wrapping up my freshman year in college and heading into a structural engineering internship (specializing in precast design and modeling) this summer. I do believe this summer's internship will be beneficial as ME, because precast design is similar to designing parts that all fit together to build something (just in this case, a building instead of a machine or something). \n\nWhile I feel that this is a good opportunity for me as a freshman without many skills, I was just concerned about my resume only listing civil engineering firms, as next year I hope to secure an internship in ME or aerospace. \n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions on how I can best market the skills I learned in civil/structural engineering to more ME contexts? Alternatively, are there any skills I can start working on (other than CAD, which I'm already learning) or certifications I should be trying to get? I'd appreciate any advice y'all may have!",

However, I am struggling to bridge the gap between academic learning and practical application in the workplace.\n\nDespite investing five years in my education, I find myself unable to effectively apply or recall basic engineering concepts such as Engineering Mechanics, Strength of Materials, and Fluid Mechanics( I was an average student). Even after dedicating extra hours to revisiting these subjects, I still fall short of what is expected of me in my role.\n\nMy manager has expressed disappointment in my performance, and I feel that he is surprised I managed to pass my degree and secure the job ( his facial expressions and cold approach). This feedback has severely impacted my confidence and has left me questioning whether I genuinely possess the natural aptitude for engineering.\n\nThe ongoing struggle has taken a toll on my mental and physical well-being. I constantly fear being terminated, and my anxiety has affected my social interactions in the office. The uncertainty and self-doubt are becoming overwhelming.\n\nI am now at a crossroads, contemplating whether to take a break to focus solely on revisiting and strengthening my core engineering concepts before attempting to re-enter the field. Alternatively, I also think this is an indication that engineering may not be the right fit for me and if I should explore other career paths.\n\nI would greatly appreciate any insights, guidance, or advice from those who have faced similar challenges or who can provide a fresh perspective on how to navigate this situation.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read and respond",

However, during my degree I did complete on a year-long research project as well as another year-long group-based design project with an external company. Since graduating, I have predominately worked as an academic copyeditor of STEM research papers to prepare them for publication while living quite frugally.

However, AI has largely reduced the amount of available work in this industry, and after 10 years of work as a copyeditor I would like to pursue something more challenging, fulfilling, and stable with better pay.\n\nI am wondering if anybody has any advice for someone in my situation for possible routes. Would I be considered acceptable for engineering jobs if I were to begin applying today? Would doing a Master's/PhD program help to reacquaint me with dormant engineering skills and improve job prospects? Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!",

Music was my life and I wanted to have a career in it so I focused on it exclusively in high school.\n\nBecause of some severe educational neglect I faced as a child (No formal schooling until 8th grade) I never really saw myself doing an occupation that requires a lot of brains (Lawyer, Docter, Etc.,) and because of my highschool I was pretty set on being a musician. Come senior year my dad cracks down on me, tells me I have to go to a college and get a \"real degree\" (preferably a B.S.)\n\nI am now a undecided freshman and I'm trying to figure out what I want to do with myself. For awhile the only thing I could imagine myself doing and being happy was music but over the last year I've been considering law school. I absolutely love debating and politics and have a huge passion for civil rights and public policy.\n\nAlong with this, ever since I was young I have LOVED math. It comes very easy for me and even when it doesn't it doesn't matter because I just love it so much and find it so much fun. I guess I really like puzzles and problem solving. For the longest I felt like there was nothing I could do with this passion. Getting a degree in mathematics doesn't sound like it would directly transfer to any sort of job outside of academia.\n\nSo now I'm thinking about engineering. I figure with a love of math it might be something worth exploring. So my question is where could I start? I don't know what the different disciplines of engineering entail so where could I find out more and start dipping my toes into to see if something sticks?",

If both wheels point toward the center, random small bumps on the road can be negated with respect to the axial line of the vehicle. If perfectly parallel, the surface can cause the vehicle to wander much easier. The OEM has a track out back and does hundreds of hours of logging on prototypes for a couple years to get the feel right before being approved for production. Stellantis specifications were very precise and well-written while I was there, some of the best in the industry, IMO. Worst was BMW....",

As a result, if you want to have 0 degrees of toe when actually moving, you need to set the toe out a bit when sitting still on an alignment rack.\n\nI assume the same would be true for the rear toe of rear wheel drive vehicles.\n\nI’ve also heard that the opposite will happen to the non-driven wheels (rear wheels of a front wheel drive vehicle will toe outwards a bit, so you want the toe slightly inward on the alignment rack), although I suspect the effect is less when compared to the driven wheels.\n\nOutside of that, I know that rear toe (probably front toe too) can change the handling characteristics of the car, so for performance vehicles they may set toe in or out depending on the characteristics they’re after.",

        "body": "I worked in truck engineering at GM.  I did a lot of alignments over my career.\nSeveral of the previous posts pointed out some of the considerations for wheel alignment specs.  Going down the road generates various dynamic forces on the tires and suspension.  But when setting the alignment on a vehicle it must be done statically.  GM does a lot of testing.  They have dynamic sensors that can be put on a vehicle to record x,y,z motions of each wheel in real time on a test track.  Constant alignment positioning information on the fly.  From this data they are able to determine what the static setting should be in order to have the wheel in the correct or desired position while actually being driven.  Toe is very important.  Zero toe while being driven is where late model truck and suv vehicles are set to be.  How they are set during alignment is important too.  Rear wheel drive vehicles need the toe adjustment to be made from toe out to toe in on each side.  To load the deflection slack of the linkage in the correct direction.  The set tolerance for toe is half that of check tolerance.  Meaning if you loosen it to change it you have tighter tolerance.  Radial tires are common now but before them more toe was needed to keep the tread straight while driving.  Radial tires squrim more and stick better so less toe was required.  As testing refined models already in production sometimes alignment specs were upgraded.  Out in the service world specs for older vehicles were listed as the non superceeded specs.  Confusing to everyone.\n\nHere is an interesting tidbit.  If your toe setting is off by a half degree it is the same as dragging both front tires sidways almost 50 feet for every mile driven.  That puts tire wear, energy usage and toe importance in perspective.",

How about a Differential Equation, Laplace Transform or Transfer Equation?\n\nEngineers use those, Matlab, Simulink and any other proprietary software they have to model complex systems....and yes, a car's suspension is a very complex system.\n\nI'm going to simplify this alot but generally the Control System simulation/modeling works by breaking down complex systems into smaller, easier to manage, sub-systems.  They can figure out the overall equations of motion for that subsystem or use software to help them out.\n\nA simplified suspension system can be modeled like this.\n\n[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed-Ali-29/publication/299579915/figure/fig2/AS:346555862274049@1459636764114/Block-diagram-of-control-system.png](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ahmed-Ali-29/publication/299579915/figure/fig2/AS:346555862274049@1459636764114/Block-diagram-of-control-system.png)\n\nThey place this into software, tell the software what the values of each should be (each portion has it's own equation) and then add a monitor or output here/there.  When they run the simulation, you have to provide values for each component. Example: the spring can be modeled as an energy capacitor and modeled using units of Newton\\*Meter or Pounds\\*Feet.  Say know the spring you want to use needs to hold a car that weighs X amount of pounds, well then model that spring needing to hold at minimum 1/4th the total weight you want it to hold.  You enter similar values for all components in the units they use (a damper will be a resistor so Newtons/second, etc) and run the simulation.  The results, when read properly, can tell you stuff like how much travel the suspension will have when hitting a bump, how much shock will be transferred back into the car, and how much time it will take for the suspension to stop cycling and plant the wheels back on the road.  Once you have these values narrowed down for what you want (you just make adjustments until the results are what you're looking for) this sub-model gets plugged into a larger model and the whole thing is ran together.\n\nAgain, it can get super complicated and requires a lot of record keeping to make sure you can keep track of it and so that others working on it can understand what is what and what's going on.  Because on complex systems, you won't be the only person working on this.  There may be entire teams dedicated to just something as small as the tires, or spring rates.\n\nFor the other Engineers out there, Controls Engineering isn't my specialty so if you have corrections or additions to add, please do so.",

        "body": "First let's talk about battery inverters (grid-scale). They can be programmed with software to behave however you want, as long as they can supply enough power to meet the behavior. In general they are programmed to provide stability to the grid, as far as I know. I have seen articles about how the battery banks in Australia do exactly this. In theory, they can react much faster than a human could even notice a problem and react. But I am not sure if they are programmed to do that.\n\nNow let's talk about solar inverters. They can be programmed to back-off when the demand falls (I am not sure if this is done in Spain, but newer inverters in California must do this if they supply to the grid) but they cannot increase the power they send to the grid beyond the max power. Generating max power is their normal and default mode of operation. The way this is accomplished in California is that they respond to a frequency increase by backing off on generation. The two things that tend to happen when supply collapses are that the machines (generators) all speed up, and the voltage increases. That speedup leads to a frequency increase and possibly a voltage increase also. Modern California compliant inverters will self-curtail if the voltage increases too much or if the frequency increases beyond what is normal. Otherwise they will try to ride through any short term disturbance.\n\nSo Solar inverters without battery storage can throttle back to stabilize the grid in case of rapid demand collapse, at least in theory. But they cannot step in with extra power unless they were previously throttled back.\n\nIn fact, early grid tie inverters were designed to be very picky about power. If the incoming voltage was not nearly perfect, they would assume something was wrong and immediately stop export. But this actually started to cause stability problems for the grid because you don't necessarily want all that supply to shut down when there is a disturbance.\n\nI am sure people are going to be studying the recent problems in Spain and Portugal. It is certainly possible that a disturbance caused solar inverters to shut down, increasing the disturbance and leading to a cascading supply collapse. But I don't think anyone actually knows yet. This is kind of like a plane crash. Have to give people time to figure out exactly what happened and then they will figure out the best way to solve it.\n\nI know that some people are saying \"this must have been caused by solar, let's stop this green madness and go back to burning fuel.\" I don't think we know that is what happened yet. And even if that is what happened, the problem can be solved other ways (for example by increasing battery storage).",

Besides, the perturbations are a symptom, not a cause, so the issue is unlikely to be perturbations in frequency by itself.\n\nIn terms of actual causes, grids are computer controlled and the computer monitors real/reactive power, production, line breakers, everything it can. Then it builds a state model, then disconnects or reconfigures the grid as needed to keep it stable. Usually when a grid collapses, it will be because this computer didn't know something it needed to know. Either a set of sensors were down or were never installed. In the 2003 US grid collapse, a computer failure prevented the computer's state configuration from being updated in real time, so as the grid deteriorated and the computer needed to be shedding load, it couldn't because it didn't know.\n\nAfter-all, most grid problems can be solved by shedding the right amount of load at the right time.

Portugal shut down the last coal plant a few years ago, since then we have been more than 90% renewable, with some gas power for peak demand, even if we still had that coal plant it wouldn't help in this crash and it also wouldn't help with the black-start.\n\nWe don't have oil or natural gas on the ground, we do have lots of sun, wind and mountains for hydro, being independent here means going with renewable power and electric cars, our future is great. This was a freak accident, one of a kind, yes there was some incompetence at the political level over the years that made the grid less reliable, but we will be more strong going forward.\n\nWe need to keep up this evolution path and add batteries to the grid, we don't even need much, just a few \"strong pillars\" to isolate this kind of problems and provide frequency stability, and if we want we can add more and be completely free from the gas peaker plants.

Natural convection heat loss would be minimal in this configuration. If lateral IR was needed, a reflective surface could be used below. The air captured below the heater is then very insulating.\n\nWith minimal convective and conductive air losses this would increase IR efficiency.\n\nCoupled IR and convective losses were studied extensively in the 1970's under a US DOE grant, with application to flat plate thermal solar collectors which were at different angles varying with latitude. In practice, the absorption plate was a selective surface, dark in optical wavelengths, shiny in IR wavelengths. That reduced IR losses to the glass cover plate. A Teflon 2D honeycomb could reduce turbulent convective losses up to certain temperature where the turbulent convective cells were smaller than the honeycomb spacing. That transition temperature was actually a design point that could limit the temperatures if the heat exchange fluid was not flowing, as a result of failure or the water tank reaching its shutoff point. I was installing a water heating setup on a cloudy day and then the clouds cleared and I burned a finger on the fluid connector. That actually felt good! Wiped some spit onto it and it sizzled. When the system shutdown, the collectors delivered steam until the collector was dry. The double wall stainless steel water heater had a thermal sensor located at a certain point and it was very stable with minimal convective losses and the tank above the sensor could easily exceed 212°F and steam could come out of hot water faucets. The arrangement had some need of improvement, it was in some regards too good.",

This unfortunately dropped me down to a 2.37.\n\nNow here we are six years later, and I'm trying to turn my life around going back to school. I'm only really interested in STEM fields (ideally chemical engineering), but it looks like it's going to be a real challenge to find a decent school that will take me with so many competitive GPA requirements. I've done the math, and even straight A's in everything left to finish my associates degree will only bring me to about a 2.7-2.9, which has been fairly disheartening.\n\nIs it too late; should I look into something else besides engineering? Are there other similar STEM fields (preferably surrounding chemistry and/or physics) I should look towards instead due to my mistakes? I've been working for months on trying to make this work. I'd hate to just give up at this point, but I can't keep paying for community college if I can't expect it to go anywhere. Are there ways I can convince these schools that a poor year in my life doesn't reflect me entirely? Has anyone overcome similar circumstances?\n\nI'm truly open to alternatives if this isn't a reality. I'd just love to do something more meaningful and make more than food service and warehouses are giving me.\n\nFor more context, I'm planning on moving to Michigan this summer, so those are the schools I'm primarily looking at, but Virginia is my alternative for moving if it promises a better opportunity for my future.\n\nThanks to anyone who has any advice or perspective for me to consider.

I have around 20 days to teach myself as much as I can to prepare myself for this interview, is there a good place to start to prepare myself for this? Is it possible to teach myself all of this in that amount of time? From my understanding on some quick googles the documents are mainly verifying information such as materials, so I assume I'll be spending more time looking into how to properly read the blueprints than I would the rest of it.

        "body": "120k in Paper/Pulp or 110k Full Remote Eng Firm?\n\nThis sub helped me make my last major career decision 3yrs ago, I’m hoping to get some insight again! Posting here in case my discussion post is deleted.\n\nI have 5 YOE - 1.5yrs electromechanical contractor specializing in air filtration, 8mos HVAC project engineer, 3yrs Paper/Pulp multidisciplinary project engineer, currently a senior. The role I’m considering is a full remote lead electrical project engineer at a firm I’ve worked with extensively. Good people, my team is based about 4hrs from me and I’d be the first full remote in the team (not in the company).\n\nThe firm approached me for my unique experience. I moved to the P/P company into a team of 5 project engineers in the capital eng department. Avg of 42YOE across the existing team, my position opened due to retirement. The other 4 retired or quit within the year, I’ve been running the department alone for 2 yrs. No hires, just a blinding amount of work. I delivered a $20MM project (the new firm met me on this project), 3x $2-5MM projects, and ~10x $<1MM projects during that time, with no onsite aid.\n\nAfter me threatening to quit from overwork the company moved an operations manager to manage me and a random civil guy they found, no project experience in either. The new manager has told corporate this team can deliver $60MM in 2026 across 5 projects, even though he’s fully aware I’m the only person who has delivered a project. Again, no onsite CM, PM, Scheduler, Admin assistant, nothing.\n\nHere’s my questions: \n1. Is a lead engineer role at a firm equal to my senior role? Once I get my PE the offer letter explicitly stated I get a 10k bump and title change to Electrical PM. Salary would stay basically unchanged, benefits largely wash out. Firm offers paid overtime and I know from experience they rarely expect it, I worked almost 340hrs in April for our annual outage with no overtime.\n\n2. How boring is remote engineering work? Expected travel is up to 1wk/3mos until the title change, then up to 1wk/1mos. Otherwise I’ll be sitting in my home office. I’m currently elbow deep in grease and mud most of the time when constructing a project, I’ll never construct a project in the new role. I’m worried that’ll get boring.\n\n3. Would you, the reader, make this move? With the operations guy being my boss I don’t see a promotion in my current role anytime soon. The mill is in poor shape, our electrical team has mostly retired and knowledge gaps are now common. I love my guys, but I’ve had to do everything from lead emergency switchgear maintenance to run E&I technician crews when their supervisors quit. Weekend work is common, more so now that my boss is from operations.\n\n4. Assuming you’d make the move, what steps would you take to warn the mill the new Eng manager’s promises are impossible? The mill is the only thing keeping this area afloat, I’d hate for a massive misstep to damage its reputation in corporate. This mill was known for its excellent engineering department, I’ve tried to uphold that legacy and corporate trusts me implicitly. The director of engineering instructed my boss to send me to the annual engineering managers meeting in his place, since I know what’s going on and he doesn’t.",

I’ll give the details of both below without exposing too much information.\n\nManufacturing Engineer intern\n- Massive company manufactures electronics for automotive, aerospace, defense, medical, and energy\n-pay - $35/hr and substantial relocation assistance\n-I was told I could work on a number of projects from developing new products, optimizing costs, and process improvement\n\n\nMechanical Engineer intern\n- massive company that acquires other companies (lowkey monopoly) designs and manufactures security products\n- pay $25/hr no relocation\n- I’d be working on design reviews, CAD, 3D printing, tolerance studies\n\nHere are my concerns/interests. I really like designing products and coming up with unique solutions to issues. I think both opportunities allow me to do that, but the second one more so. At face value the manufacturing opportunity is significantly better because I am in no way from a wealthy background and that is more money than ive ever seen before. However, apparently many people in manufacturing engineering don’t like it do to the conditions of work so I’m a bit hesitant to put my foot fully into that path. So I’m wondering if I would be sort of stuck in that field if I end up not liking it. Both companies have a conversion from intern to full-time based on timing of hiring. Both companies are fairly expansive in location.\n\nPlease let me know if any more information is needed.\n\nAlso let me know if I should consider more factors.",

They mounted accelerometers to prove the resulting forces approximated the shipping vibration spec that otherwise would have required a megabuck programmable vibration table.  Something like this could probably be done with material at hand and a decommissioned iPhone.  \n\nShipping vibration involves high displacement at relatively low frequencies, and is a different animal from structural vibration of electronic assemblies which is higher frequencies and smaller displacement in a random or  sine-sweep profile. The core mechanism for this is basically the same as an audio speaker and I wonder whether a decommissioned speaker or subwoofer coil coupled with a hard plate driven by a signal generator and audio amp could put out enough motion for a poor-man's version for low-mass assemblies.   \n\nYou might also look into variable-speed tile shakers, which are powerful and inexpensive.\n\nIn all these cases I'd  expect a good deal of trial- and-error to get close to a particular spec, but if your goal is to teach the process and improve your projects' robustness even a rough approximation will do.",

If the seesaw is balanced, the torque is only needed to overcome friction (which should be negligible) and for acceleration and deceleration, so you would need to specify how fast it need to accelerate or change directions of motion.\n\nFor safety of people near it, you'd want to consider not just the nominal torque of the motor but the maximum stall torque, which would depend on how it is controlled, not just the motor specs.  If that were 60 Nm, that's 60 N of force at the end of a 1 m arm, which is 6 kg force.  That's a lot and could certainly hurt some body parts, but it's not like it would completely crush a person.  I'm not saying it's safe though because I don't know what pinch points there are, how fast it's moving, or what the real stall torque is. \n\nBy the way, the torque that would be needed to overcome gravity if if wasn't balanced and just had one 15 kg weight on one side would be (1 m)(9.81 N/kg)(15 kg) = 147 Nm.

The intent is to just sit in one place the vast majority of the time. It would only move (very slowly) in search of calm weather. It would be a haven for [Perpetual Travelers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_traveler), a demographic that tends to have lots of money available to spend on deluxe accommodations. \n\nBut I'd say no because of:\n\n1) The only practical propulsion for such a beast would be nuclear. Triply so once you consider the power needs of 80,000 people. And civilian marine nuclear power has a spotty record. The western NS Savannah was never profitable because the upkeep on its reactor was too expensive. The only other uses for civilian marine nuclear power has been ice breakers which are owned and operated by governments. It's hard to picture a floating city, guided by the Libertarian mindset that is behind such proposals, being top notch in terms of nuclear safety. \n\n2) Logistics would be a nightmare. It's really hard to wrap your head around how much consumables supply that many people need. Most Disney cruises need several tractor trailer loads of supply every time it returns to home port. And that's just for 5,000 people for 5 days. If you've ever taken a major cruise, you have had a chance to see just how the arrival of a few cruise ships absolutely dominates shore traffic and onshore activity. The vast majority of desirable island destinations just couldn't support a visit from a behemoth like the Freedom. Even major European and Asian ports would find it daunting. I can't see such places being willing to make massive investments in shore line infrastructure to cater to one vessel that will only visit occasionally and might never visit if there is a change in tax legislation. \n\n3) Port access is its own problem. No port or marina in the world is big enough to hold it. At many ports of call you'd need a small fleet of vessels providing sea taxi service. A fact which only makes the resupply angle even more challenging. How do you get rid of your vast quantities of sewage if you can't pull up to the pier to get pumped out?  Again, most ports of call won't have the necessary infrastructure. No small tanker based \"honey wagon\" sewage services. \n\n4) There is plans for a landing field on the roof. But there are not enough stands for the number of private jets you can expect with a city of 80,000 rich people. I'll point out that military aircraft carrier operations is a highly specialized, complex and dangerous task. All of which means expensive. How many private jet pilots, airborne limo drivers, are rated for carrier operations?",

Who’s paying for their housing and the housing for the workers who support them, or are they going to commute?  Who’s paying for the maintenance staff because tradespeople who work on systems on deep sea oil rigs are really, really expensive.   It’s not something pumping out millions of dollars a month of profit.   You can’t dry dock it.   All work will be done at sea on live systems.  And the sea, unlike the land, is a location completely inhospitable to human life.  It’s not trying to kill you, it has no purpose or intelligence, but it has very little that would allow your survival without help. \n\nCruise ships are only so good of a model because they can and are routinely drydocked for maintenance.  Staff salaries are discounted because free travel. Port calls allow massive resupply opportunities for everything from fresh water to butt wipe and wine.

It's a cruise ship pretending to be a colony that expects other ports to be glad to see them.\n\n2.  Freedom is a buzzword that fails rapidly in the \"there are rules, heirarchies, and hard jobs that must be followed or we all die\" environment of a ship.  Just ask the MS Satoshi, what happened when a bunch of \"my freedom first and only\" cryptobros tried to buy a bog standard cruise ship and convert it to this concept.  Surprise!  Existing countries will also expect ships to follow their rules, or else no you can not come into port.\n\n3.  Ships require repair.  Some of this repair requires being in a dry dock.

        "body": "Cross axis sensitivity: input along one axis can yield output along different axis.\n\nNonlinearity: output sensitivity changes at different loads. A 2g load may output a 2 and a 8g may output a 6.5 on the same device, for instance. So you need to calibrate.\n\nIf you want good performance out of the box, you need a calibrated AHRS (attitude and heading reference system). These are still a bit pricey on the low end (~$400), but can give you decent performance for 15-30 minutes at most. Modules made for UAS are a place to start. In your case, I’d say your AHRS software implementation is your biggest lever for performance, not a new device.\n\nUsually you’d calibrate some kind filter (e.g. Kalman filter) to give you acceptable short-term acceleration or gyro stability on a per-device basis. If you do the calibration yourself, you could save a good portion of the cost. There are AHRS implementations on github, too, if you haven't checked them out already. But you still need to calibrate whatever filters they use.\n\nBoth the accel and gyro will have errors like those you've described because they are heavily influenced by their material properties and heat. Consequently, repeatability is always an issue, and you'll likely find repeatability metrics on the datasheets as well. You also have numerical integration errors due to floating point precision. Premium systems cost more because they were designed to minimize material errors and were likely calibrated on a device-by-device basis.\n\nIf you really want to get an idea for whether a good accelerometer or good gyro is worth it, you can simulate it. Write a script that follows some path with noisy accelerations and rotations. Do one with a perfect accelerometer and another with a perfect gyro. Which one gives you more favorable results? My guess is that it won't matter. What matters is the AHRS.",

        "body": "Cross-axis error is probably one of the least impactful aspects of error - in all honesty, the thing that builds error the fastest in INSes is time, the longer you go, the worse it gets. Time precision as it pertains to sampling rate precision is also quite important, but if you're careful it's pretty easy to control for that.\n\nIf we're talking dead reckoning error, there's accelerometers (linear) and gyros (rotational).\n\nAccelerometers are *terrible* at dead reckoning because you integrate twice with respect to time, so any error grows exponentially. There tends to be a few sources of noise - the big one will be bias, where the accelerometer's \"zero\" isn't actually at zero acceleration, but drifts the longer you're on. Generally this is something you estimate with an observer like a Kalman, provided you can get some form of outside observable - even just a 'I don't think I'm moving right now' (or a ZUPT) is super useful, but it has to happen somewhat regularly - biases change with respect to time, that's called the bias stability. There is also random noise in the signal that when integrated will accumulate error - this is called velocity random walk. That grows with the square root of time, and usually can be filtered out somewhat, so it's rarely a driving factor in an INS but will be worse in a chipscale IMU.\n\nGyros are better at dead reckoning, you only integrate once to get heading, so error grows linearly with time. They have the same sources of error - bias, bias stability, and noise - but tend to be more stable. The issue is that angular error can have an outsized impact in your final position estimate - if you walk exactly 100m in a straight line but are off by a degree in heading, your final position error will be off by roughly 1.7m. Plus, getting initial heading is really, really difficult - magnetometers are noisy and can be affected by other sources, dGPS is expensive and finicky, gyrocompassing requires IMUs that costs as much as a house...\n\nThere are other sources of error, of course - cross-axis, scale factor, g-dependency, numeric precision, temperature nonlinearity - but some of those can be taken out with a good online estimator, others can small enough that you'll have to have slain all the easy ones before you are worried about them. The real trick is finding and using good external references to do good sensor fusion if you want to do any practical inertial navigation. Cameras with optical flow or landmark detection do wonders, encoders on wheeled vehicles coupled with a simple AHRS can outperform most pure INSes in all but very slippery terrain, GPS is kinda hit and miss (though if you can do RTK that solves 90% of the problem right off the bat, and there are some cool open source projects to make that a reality), something fun like UWB location tags can help... INSes are wonderful in that they really can't be fooled, but you need some pretty expensive hardware if you want to rely on them alone.",

It's just a very basic thumb suck error/variation tolerance stack up factor)\n\n\nYou first need to know this before you can understand where and how much of a safety factor you should reasonably apply.\n\n\nIt's entirely plausible your professor doesn't actually know or understand the answer.\n\n\n\nIs it over stress, overload (input force), over displacement, energy absorption, poor material properties, manufacturing error, etc.\n\n\nClassically, a bridge pier may be 3x stronger than it needs to be to hold up the bridge and every vehicle that may ever cross the bridge, but still not strong enough to handle a boat running into it.\n\n\n\nDoes it make sense to apply a factor of safety to a vertical loaf calculation, if the load you are guarding against is a lateral load?\n\n\n--- --- --\n\n\n*Anyway, back to the more specific question.* I haven't actually reviewed this stuff in a while, but just reasoning my way to an answer:\n\n\nWhat is a stress concentration factor? It is the ratio of actual peak stress in an object near some part to the (nominal) stress in the object if it didn't have that particular geometric feature or shape. It's a magic number you multiply by so you can do simple maths and still get usable results.\n\n\nIt's a positive scalar, so it pushes stress values away from zero (Compressive stresses are more negative, tensile stresses are more positive ) ie, it increases the magnitude of the calculated stress.\n\n\nSo, if you have a nice sinusoidal loading pattern (or other perfectly symmetrical loading pattern) then the mean stress will simply be the average of thlinax and min stresses.\n\n\nActual Mean stress = (Kf x Nom_Max + Kf x Nom_Min)/2\n\n\n= Kf (Max + Min)/2\n\n\nSo in this case, yes you should multiply the (nominal) mean stress by Kf.\n\n\nIf however you were to first calculate the actual peak stresses, and find the average of these, then no, you would not apply it, as it has already been applied. Ie.\n\n\nActual Max = Kf x Nom_Max\nActual Min = Kf x Non_Min\n\n\nActual Mean = (Actual Max + Actual Min)/2\n\nIn the special case of zero mean stress, well it's zero no matter what you multiply by - so even if you do it 'wrong' you'll still get the right answer.\n\nAs for the yielding check, if the part (for example, a bolt) yirlds under the mean or preloaf stress, then the material will yield and deform instead.\n\n\nHookes law no longer applies, and for small deformations, the yield stress will be the maximum possible stress. This effectively shifts the whole stress range down so that the actual peak stress is now equal to the yield stress.\n\n\nErgo, if you calculate a (nominal) mean stress which would cause yielding at the notch, your assumption (of linearity) is wrong - that's not possible.",

        "body": "You’re getting bad answers here from people who don’t really know what they’re talking about. Frustrating on a sub that should know better. Fatigue is complicated and frequently misunderstood, and people spewing random crap doesn’t help.\n\nDadEngineerLegend’s answer is essentially correct, but missing a few details. From a basic first principles approach on a simple problem, Shigley’s is correct and your professor is wrong. Kf will apply to both the mean and alternating stress, as shown in the derivation by DadEngineer.\n\nHe is also on the right track by bringing up yielding around a stress concentrator or notch. What happens when you have a high preload? Say we preload a bolt to 90% of yield and alternate about that stress. A typical Kf for a bolt is 3.0 for rolled threads or 4.0 for cut threads. That suggests we need to account for a bolt mean stress of 270-360% of yield (likely going over ultimate strength). That’s clearly absurd, and doesn’t match reality because of plasticity. \n\nNow, we have a few things we can do.\n\n(1) We could throw away the stress-life approach and move to a strain-life approach. This isn’t preferred because it’s a bunch of complexity added to the analysis and there’s much less data out there on strain life. This is the “correct” way, but isn’t realistic to apply all the time.\n\n(2) We can say “clearly applying Kf to the mean stress is wrong, let’s just ignore it.” This is what your professor has done. This is non-conservative (a very scary word in the analysis world) and based on faulty reasoning. Unfortunately this is a very common approach.\n\n(3) We try to understand the problem and apply a heuristic that can fix the flaws in our stress life approach. One easy way to do that:\n\nStart by applying Kf to both mean and alternating stress. We know that this local peak stress, Kf*(Sm+Sa), must stay below the ultimate strength of the material otherwise it would rupture. Do a quick check to make sure the bolt has adequate ductility and net-section capability to handle the applied load statically. That gives a technical justification to our assumption you won’t rupture the bolt under static loads.\n\nGiven that info, we can instead enforce Sm,effective+Sa,effective < Sult. Kf is fixed, and Sa,e and Sm,e are unknown. We prefer to err on the side of conservatism, which is a large Sa,e. Well, the it turns out we do know Sa,e because the largest it could possibly be is Kf*Sa.\n\nSo Sa,e = Kf*Sa.\n\nThen Sm,e + Kf * Sa = Sult. \n\nSolving for Sm,e: Sm,e = Sult - Kf*Sa.\n\nNow we can use our normal stress life curves and Goodman equation with Sa,e and Sm,e with no Kf because it’s already baked in.\n\nThis is the most conservative heuristic we can apply. You can make other arguments for why the peak stress should be even lower than Sult, but the idea is the same. Neuber’s rule comes to mind as one way.\n\nI’d recommend you dig around Efatigue if you want to learn more. It’s a fantastic resources run by a world renowned fatigue expert. This is all backed up in his notes in the Technical Background/Stress Life/Mean Stresses section.",

So by definition you only need to apply stress concentration factors kf or kt based on the geometry, and type of loading(cyclic). Because only cyclic loading will create large fatigue issues because the material goes through elastic deformation, and no material is perfectly elastic there will always be some plastic deformation. \"https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/fatigue-stress-concentration-factor-kf.940640/\"\n\nNominal stress, means there is a constant load on structure, think like dead load. \n\n\"The empirical expressions and curves for kf and k’f are based on trends \nand data observed under completely reversed loading. Therefore, they \ncannot be applied directly if mean stresses are present.\" since mean stresses are by definition an avarage of the applies stress ranges. \n\nLike a gear taking up load then releasing it, or taking up more stress then releasing that stress over the cycle of application would be a constant force and strain would be fully reversed. Where as a motor enginer idling would produce mean stresses, and then the stesss max from revving up or down, would change non lenearly. And the way compounding or cancelling waves can cause additional peaks or cancel each other out entirely, you cant directly apply kf and need to rely on test data more for accuracy. Because means could compound to higher than expected stress values over many cycles, leading to higher fatigue. That university of soul pdf slides goes into all this nicely.",

Aluminum is really good at conducting heat, this is why it is a common choice for heat sinks and cooling fins. When welding thin walled steel tubes the common practice is to insert an aluminum heatsink inside the tube to help limit distortion from the heat of the welding.\nThe high thermal conductivity means that more heat will transfer from the pan to the handle then a material with a lower one. The dissipation of that heat into the air around it has more to do with the shape of the handle and the air currents around it then the thermal conductivity of it. A handle is not a very good shape for losing heat to conduction so it will tend to heat up quite a bit",

        "body": "I worked on a project a couple of years ago where we were designing a heat exchanger system for a factory, and one of the things we had to consider was how heat would transfer through various materials under different conditions. From what I remember, when heat moves through a solid, like the walls of a pipe or a heat exchanger, the transfer is usually slower than in liquids or gases. But the specific rate depends on the material’s thermal conductivity, the temperature difference, and the flow rate of the surrounding medium. We used a lot of simulations to predict how quickly heat would transfer from the hot fluid to the cooler one in the system. The biggest challenge was making sure we weren’t overestimating how quickly heat would dissipate, which would have messed with our energy efficiency calculations.\n\nIn another project, I was looking at how heat transfer works in a vacuum, which is a whole different beast. Without air or any other medium to carry the heat away, most of the transfer happens through radiation. I remember being surprised at how much of an impact that could have, especially when we were designing something for a space application. Heat transfer in those conditions can be incredibly slow and inefficient, which is why we had to think about insulation and reflective materials to prevent excessive heat buildup. Honestly, it felt like every small detail mattered so much more than I expected when it came to heat transfer, and those decisions really affect the overall performance of the system.",

They can reduce the concentration of ions, or (I think this is more common) forms layers that resist the free movement of ions.",

This would be lugging the engine and is bad. \n\nDepending on how your simulator is making the computation, there will be a range where it's valid and where not.

You can see that the maximum efficiency for this engine is actually around 80% throttle at ~2000-2400 RPM, and even down at 1000RPM at full throttle, it's more efficient than it is at 3000 RPM at the 20% throttle or so that would be making the same power.\n\nThat having been said, as you say it would make the car very unresponsive, and that's also pretty hard on the engine to run that way. High load at low RPM is very hard on the bearings and creates very high peak cylinder pressure, so it's probably not advisable to lug it too far.",

Instead the side legs and stretchers move between a rectangle and a parallelogram to raise and lower the top. You could fix it at a certain height with one diagonal brace, running corner to corner, that has an releasable connection to a corner, maybe a clamp or a bolt through holes in the brace. To lower the top, you release the brace, let the top drop, then reclamp the brace.

IE people generally don’t use an extra 300 for LiDAR scanning, but they also don’t have a grand caravan perform at almost every air show. \n\nOnce you have that done focus on getting it to do one thing. fly it by hand and then feed the ai as much of the telemetry as you can; be ready to correct dumb behaviors.",

It's hard (but not necessarily rare) to standardise screw piles systems for a \"packaged\" product that generally varies itself (e.g. shade sail systems).\n\nThe starting assumptions you have provided are appreciated but likely more are required depending on your tolerance for comparison purposes.\n\nA key issue I foresee, but would like to clarify first, is the posts of your shade sails and if they have a guy wire attached or similar?\nIf not, then I noticed you're considering an uplift case but the limiting factor may be bending/rotation.\n\nAdditionally, screw piles tend to be used in specific scenarios where it becomes economically viable compared to alternative, non-traditional, methods. Based on your opening post it seems you have considered this anyway, which is great. \n\nI'll assume a few things to begin including supplier information (more on this in item 2), purely an uplift case, 4 post distribution of 50m2 sail and host of other simplifications.\n\nIn direct answer to your questions (number 2 first):\n\n2. Your screw piles size, and subsequent design, will largely depend on what you can source. Manufacturers occasionally provide SWL (of the pile itself, not application) as a design input for project specific design calculations. I always take this with a grain of salt as it's derived from, yet again, a number of assumptions. Similarly installation torque may be necessary to derive uplift/bearing capacities which is unknown until you complete the work.\n\nIt's absolutely possible to talk to a fabricator and negotiate a custom bulk quantity, but the downside is you will need to engage an engineer to design the capacity of the screw pile on a more \"fundamental basis\".\n\n1. This is the unfortunate question having unlimited outcomes without a large amount of assumptions. This will also change on every site. \n\nFor an extraordinary number of assumptions and simplifications, let's assume you have 4 posts for the sail, 1.5 kPa ult load, vertically applied, equally load shared, nothing else matters but pure uplift and soil mechanics are whatever I can think of as I write. You will need about 19kN of resistance. Let's assume you have a 300 dia helix flight which means you need about 5D of depth or 1.5m minimum. If you reached this depth then you could maybe claim 38 kN of uplift capacity or maybe 19 kN with safety factors. So ballpark maybe 1.5m deep +- 3m of accuracy.  For simplicity I would find an off the shelf screw pile with a claimed SWL of 19kN as well.\n\n3. Actual Concrete size is probably smaller than what you have numbered in your post. comp strength generally doesn't matter as much as size and reo. So probably ok for assumptions. I suggest when doing the refined design to include sw of the pile cap in tension calcs etc. to find efficiently. \n\nAnchor size is fine, I would assume 4-M16, 200 embedment or similar if h.d. bolts with 200 + 200 crank. \n\nAgain this all depends on load cases and true set up. I'm thinking of pure uplift only. \n\nI would also suggest considering an adaptor plate between pile and posts to forego concrete.",

Be sure to screen the intake so critters can't climb into the duct. Pull air from some shaded region of your property, through the long buried duct, then into your house. That'll take the edge off of the high temperatures a bit.\n\nOf you can try indirect evaporative cooling... set up water misters around the outside of the house, spraying away from the house. When it's hot, turn them on. The evaporation will take the edge off the high temperature, but with the high humidity, it won't be cold (like it would be in a low-humidity locale).\n\nI used some 1/3 GPH misters (with bronze nozzles... don't use the plastic nozzles, they're junk) which worked with 40 psi pressure, and put them along the eaves of the house and all around the fence encompassing the backyard. Even when RH was relatively high (60 to 70 percent), it cooled things off.

You haven’t provided this info so the best I can do is speculate.\n\nFans won’t help if the outside isn’t cooler than the inside. This may be true at night, so that would be the time to exhaust hot air out of the room and cause cooler air to be drawn in. In the day all you can do is aim the fan at yourself to allow your sweat to evaporate better. Make sure the cool air actually gets drawn through the entire room, so open windows on opposite sides of the exhaust fan, not the same side. \n\nWhat color are your curtains? Light colors only. Ideally white. Ideally reflective foil of some sort, actually. Curtains will still absorb the light that falls on them (minus what they reflect) and turn it into heat which they will then radiate into your room. So you need to maximize reflection. Curtains will also impede air flow which is either good or bad depending on the inside and outside air temperatures. There are also the exterior walls. Are they reflecting light? And is the insulation good? Insulation can help a lot, but only if you have a way to cool the room in the first place- that is, only if the outside air cools down at night so you can do your air exchange. Another helpful factor if better insulation helps is air proofing so using caulk or foam to close air gaps with the outside. Basically prevents the cool overnight air from escaping. \n\nIf closing curtains made things worse I can only assume your room was hotter than outside and closing the airflow is what made it heat up. Get a couple thermometers to track the indoor and outdoor (in the shade) temp so you can make better decisions on what to do through the day. \n\nAnd finally, there’s no real substitute for air conditioning. It removes heat even if it’s hot outside. That’s just the unfortunate reality. Can you get solar panels to offset the cost of electricity? You need to run the AC most when the panels are generating the most power so that should help.",

The water in the drums will cool off and your room building materials will cool off as well. Then during the day you close all of the windows and shades and try to keep out the heat. The drums of water will help to keep the temperature moderate throughout the day.

Because you want a game that that player *perceives* as providing a “good value“ for the money spent on the game. Because there is the trade off between a “long” game, which the player experiences a more in depth experience, but the machine makes less money per hour (because the games are longer) versus a shorter game which may insult players due to how short it is but can potentially make more money per hour because the games are shorter.\n\n\n\nthe arguement falls down in other ways: people have tried to algorithmically write movie scripts.

Flippers, drop targets, slingshots, switches, pop bumpers, etc., etc., plus the electronics to run everything. There will be evolution over time, and different manufacturers use different mechanicals. I could tell a Williams/Bally machine from a Data East machine very quickly because the flippers just feel different.\n\nThe game comes from a concept, and that comes from a designer/design team. How you lay out the existing parts to make it challenging and not too hard. What sort of gameplay the designer thinks is best. Pat Lawlor and Steve Ritchie both created great games but they have different philosophies on what makes a game good, so their games have different feels. \n\nThat part of design is the art, and you can't know what makes a good pinball machine unless you have played a lot of pinball. \n\nThere's also the creativity in creating something coherent around the design. \n\nOld old games - say in the 1970s - typically just had standard pinball parts. I have a Stern Meteor that is like that. \n\nLater on, we started seeing unique features that tend to define the game. Twilight zone has the upper magnet playfield and the clock, Funhouse has rudy, etc., etc. Those are unique and do have to be engineered from scratch and on some machines they tend to be problematic. \n\nHere's a short interview with Pat Lawlor where he talks about the process a bit:\n\n[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/interview-lawlor-on-modern-pinball-market-small-team-creativity](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/interview-lawlor-on-modern-pinball-market-small-team-creativity)",

The electromagnet switches polarity relative to the permanent magnets as it spins which is what makes it keep spinning.\n\nBrushless motors will be equal performance both ways because they contain electronics that allow any arbitrary switching of the polarity.\n\nBrushed might have non zero timing alignment on the brushes. As the motor rotates, the brushes are what transfers electricity to the spinning part via contact with a part known as a commutator. This arrangement is what flips the polarity every half rotation. Zero timing is when the brushes align to the N/S pole of the magnets in the motor and has equal performance in both directions. Phase advancing the brushes causes early switching in one direction (more power) and late switching in the other (less power). I expect a lot of brushed drills run a few degrees of timing advance in the clockwise direction since drills are mainly used in one direction. Certainly the pitch of my brushed drills is slightly different forward and reverse which supports this theory (the drill will spin faster in the phase advanced direction).",

Once the flat part of the power curve is reached, changes in gear ratio will make no difference. That is, acceleration is determined by the power output of the motors. If the motor puts out the same 1000 units of power at 1500 rpm and at 5000 rpm, then changing the gear ratio to change the motor speed from 1500 to 5000 rpm will make no difference in the acceleration.\n\nStarting in a lower gear would allow greater acceleration at low speed as the motor would reach flat part of the power curve sooner. Just making a wild guess, a lower gear might improve acceleration over the first 1/4 of the trains speed range. So, for your 300 kmph train, a lower starting gear might improve acceleration up to 75 kmph. After that, the motor will be at its max power rating even in \"high\" gear. The expense of a gearbox that can change gear ratios is just not going to be worth it when it only improves acceleration over a small range of speeds.",

        "body": "A gasoline injected engine uses a variety of sensors to measure how much air is coming into the engine, and then the ecu determines how much fuel is appropriate to inject based on the desired air fuel ratio determined by the fuel map and sensor feedback. So the driver generally controls the throttle, and the ecu fills in the blanks of the needed amount of fuel.\n\nA diesel injected engine has no throttle, as you noted. Every cylinder is always taking in the maximum amount of air, and instead the driver is controlling how much fuel is being injected. This works because a diesel engine isn't sensitive to air fuel ratio for ignition like a gasoline engine is. A diesel will burn any amount of fuel from the minimum needed to stay idling all the way to the maximum amount of fuel the cylinder has oxygen for.",

        "body": "TL;DR: They don't, they just run very, very, very lean.\n\nYup, you have a few fundamental misunderstandings of what's actually going on.  Mostly the \"dependant versus independant\" variables.\n\nWhat will help you most, is starting with a diesel engine. Diesel engines always run at wide open throttle.  The power produced is determined directly by how much fuel is injected.  Conceptually, diesels are a lot simpler than gas engines.  Mixtures doesn't matter, because diesels don't have a concept of \"mixture\".  Diesels work more like a flamethrower shooting into a room, than burning all the air in the room.  This means the fuel you burn, and therefore the energy to run the engine, is determined by the injection pump, not by \"how much air/fuel\" you admit to the engine.\n\nFor gas engines to run well, they need to burn, most, if not all, of the air in the combustion chamber.  They depend on a fairly homogeneous mixture so the flame front can reach the whole cylinder.  The way you control the the power of a gas engine, is by limiting both air, and fuel.\n\nThe range of useful mixtures where the flame front will go across the whole piston, is fairly narrow.\n\nFuel injection, and carburetors do most of the same things.  And until you get to some fun edge cases, \"to the engine\" they're identical.  They react \\~to\\~ the engine, and do not guide the engine.\n\nLean mixtures, in gas engines, cause the flame front to be very slow.  The overheating you get with lean mixtures on gas engines is due to the time it takes for the mixture to burn.  Instead of having \"combusted and expanded\" gasses like you do during normal running, you end up with active flame depositing it's heat on the exhaust valve and exhaust port.  There's less energy in total.  If your engine is running slow enough, and or your ignition timing is advanced enough, running real lean doesn't make the engine hotter.  \"Lean of peak\" operation is common in the aircraft community.",

If there is no oxygen sensor, then the ECM uses a basis fuel table that guesses a certain amount of fuel based on throttle position and RPM, but with much looser control of mixture accuracy.",

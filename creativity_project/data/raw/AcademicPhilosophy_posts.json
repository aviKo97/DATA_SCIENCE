      "title": "The origin of the Fat Man stuck in a cave thought experiment?",
      "content": "Hello! \n\nI have a fixation on the thought experiment widely known as the Trolley Problem. Who few people realize originated with Philippa Foot. Firslty as a critique of the Catholic use of the Doctrine of the Double Effect in discussions of abortion in her 1967 paper, \"The Problem of Abortion and the Doctrine of the Double Effect.\"\n\nIn her paper Foot writes on the first page:\n\n“To see how odd it would be to apply the principle like this we may consider the story, well known to philosophers, of the fat man stuck in the mouth of the cave.”\n\nShe then elaborates on the scenario:\n\n“A party of potholers have imprudently allowed the fat man to lead them as they make their way out of the cave, and he gets stuck, trapping the others behind him. Obviously the right thing to do is to sit down and wait until the fat man grows thin; but philosophers have arranged that floodwaters should be rising within the cave. Luckily (luckily?) the trapped party have with them a stick of dynamite with which they can blast the fat man out of the mouth of the cave. Either they use the dynamite or they drown. In one version the fat man, whose head is in the cave, will drown with them; in the other he will be rescued in due course. Problem: may they use the dynamite or not?”\n\nIt's clear to any that this scenario closely parallels what would later evolve into the Tram Problem, and eventually the more famous Trolley Problem (a term coined by Judith Jarvis Thomson).\n\nThe issue is this: I have searched extensively for any earlier reference to the \"fat man stuck in the cave\" scenario prior to Foot's 1967 paper but have found nothing. Her paper appears to be the earliest known source, yet she refers to the scenario as \"well known to philosophers.\" \n\nIf true, this suggests it may have been an example passed down orally or used in academic settings prior to publication. Still, it strikes me as odd that no one else seems to have written about it or preserved the example in earlier texts, given Foots own word that it's a \"well-known\" example.\n\nDoes anyone know more information regarding this pre-version of the Trolley problem? And if Foot as she says was not the original source of the problem, then can we really say that she was the original creator to the moral issue of whether it is morally permissible to kill one to save five?\n\n",

Any suggestions or resources on this would be much appreciated.

      "title": "On Gettier Problems and luck",
      "content": "This might be a slightly long post but I had an opinion or belief and want to know if it is justified.  \n\nMany of our beliefs—especially outside mathematics and logic—are grounded not in certainty but in **probabilistic justification**, usually based on **inductive reasoning**. We believe the sun will rise tomorrow, or that a clock is working properly, not because we have absolute proof, but because past regularity and absence of contrary evidence make these conclusions **highly likely**. However, this kind of belief always contains an element of **epistemic luck**, because inductive reasoning does not guarantee truth—it only makes it probable.\n\n\n\nThis leads directly into a reinterpretation of the Gettier problem. In typical Gettier cases, someone forms a belief based on strong evidence, and that belief turns out to be true—but for the “wrong” reason, or by a lucky coincidence. My argument is that this kind of luck is not fundamentally different from the kind of luck embedded in all justified empirical belief. For instance, when I check the time using a clock that has always worked, I believe it’s correct not because I know all its internal components are currently functioning, but because the probability that it is working is high. In a Gettier-style case where the clock is stopped but happens to show the correct time, the belief ends up being true *against* the odds, but in both cases, the agent operates under similar assumptions. The difference lies in how consequential the unknown variables are, not in the structure of the belief itself.\n\n\n\nThis view also connects to the distinction between a priori/deductive knowledge (e.g. mathematics) and a posteriori/inductive knowledge (e.g. clocks, science, perception). Only in the former can we claim 100% certainty, since such systems are built from axioms and their consequences. Everywhere else, we’re dealing with incomplete data, and therefore, we can never exclude luck entirely. Hence, demanding that knowledge always exclude luck misunderstands the nature of empirical justification.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, there is a contextual element to how knowledge works in practice. When someone asks you the time, you’re not expected to measure down to the millisecond—you give a socially acceptable approximation. So if you say “It’s 4:00,” and the actual time is 3:59:58, your belief is *functionally true* within that context. Knowledge, then, may not be a fixed binary, but a graded, context-sensitive status shaped by practical expectations and standards of precision.\n\n\n\nThus, my broader claim is this: if justification is probabilistic, and luck is built into all non-deductive inferences, then Gettier problems aren’t paradoxes at all—they simply reflect how belief and knowledge function in the real world. Rather than seeking to eliminate luck from knowledge, we might instead refine our concept of justification to reflect its inherently probabilistic nature and recognise that epistemic success is a matter of degree, not absolutes. \n\nIt sounds like a mix of Linda Zagzebski and others, I don't know if this is original, just want opinions on this.",

      "title": "Is logical positivism underrated?",
      "content": "The conventional story is that logical positivism has been refuted. But is it true? Theories suffer damaging attacks all the time but stay around for long, centuries even! I can think of many contemporary works that have suffered more damaging attacks than logical positivism and are still enormously influential. Perhaps the most vivid example is Rawls, whose minimax had been already refuted BEFORE he wrote A Theory of Justice but this fact seems to have created zero problem to Rawls.\n\nNow, I’m not very familiar with philosophy of science, epistemology and neighboring fields, but isn’t logical positivism unjustly underrated? I’m browsing Ayer’s book and I think it’s a great book. A model, in fact, of analytical writing. \n\nYes, Popper—but Ayer doesn’t say that verification means what Popper refutes. The way I read it is that Ayer’s verification is some kind of defeasible but persuasive inference, not some absolute certainty that something is the case. Yes, that metaphysics is non-sensical is a metaphysical claim. But is it? And even if it technically is, isn’t this just a language trick which we could practically ignore? \n\nI’m also skeptical for another reason. Theories and “schools of thought” that drastically reduce the number of interesting things that workers in a field can legitimately do are structurally destined to be opposed by most workers in the field. Incentives matter! People are implicitly or explicitly biased against theories that argue that their job is nonsensical! \n\nGiven this structural bias, I’d say that the burden of persuasion for a critic of logical positivism should be much higher than for theories that do not face this bias. \n\nAnyway, these are all amateurish thoughts. I’m curious what the experts think. ",

      "title": "Where should I publish an interdisciplinary MA dissertation on the metaphysics underlying a major science fiction author’s work?",
      "content": "Hi everyone 👋. I have recently completed my MA in Philosophy and I am seeking some advice regarding the potential publication of my dissertation.\n\nMy dissertation explores the philosophy of one of the most influential science fiction authors of the twentieth century. More specifically, I argue that, whether consciously or not, this author consistently defends a distinctive metaphysical framework throughout both his fiction and non-fiction writings. Recognising this underlying framework, I believe, radically transforms how we interpret his entire body of work. After extensive research, I have found that there appears to be little to no academic literature addressing this particular angle, which is why I am keen to publish it — possibly first as a journal article, and eventually develop it as part of a larger book project (in the future). \n\nHowever, I am a little uncertain about how best to approach publication. Some of my professors have suggested that standard academic philosophy journals might not consider the piece, as it crosses disciplinary boundaries and involves some degree of literary analysis (the author himself not being a trained philosopher). Conversely, I do not hold formal qualifications in English literature or literary studies, which makes me hesitant about submitting to literary journals.\n\nIt is a bit frustrating, as I genuinely believe this work offers something original and valuable — especially considering how little scholarly attention this particular series has received in comparison to, say, Tolkien’s *Legendarium*. \n\nGiven the interdisciplinary nature of the dissertation, I would really appreciate any advice or recommendations. Are there any journals that specialise in publishing work at the intersection of philosophy and literature (or the philosophy of science fiction)? Or are there particular strategies for submitting interdisciplinary pieces that might increase their chances of acceptance?\n\nAny suggestions would be hugely appreciated. Thank you in advance!\n",

So if the logical monist is committed to classical logic he must think that quantum physics is flawed. But this is not rational, because it one of our best empirical theories and a priori logical principles would prescribe the limits of science. I mean a logical monist might not think that classical logic is the only true logic, but if it’s a different logic this problem also arises just in a different form. \nWhat do you guys think about the argument?

The most ideal scenario would have been to study philosophy and maths 50/50 but it didn't happen.\n\nI am going to do masters and then a PhD in mathematics and I am wondering how I should proceed with studying philosophy. I do want to get a degree at some point although it is quite unrealistic. Maybe only in Europe where eduction is cheap. Mathematics provides good income so maybe get a philosophy degree some time later in life. \n\nI study philosophy mostly through online classes and lectures. I seldom read philosophy books and I sadly don't have much time to read books any way. Nevertheless, I think I am familiar with a lot of central philosophical ideas and philosophical discourse in general. However, I am probably bad at doing philosophy. I probably wouldn't be able to write a good philosophical essay, it would probably be something more like fiction or poetry, which largely describes my relation to philosophy.\n\nI welcome any advice on how I should go about studying philosophy. My main concerns are that I can't devote too much time to it and that I don't want it become a burden and maintain a relatively easy and fun relationship with it. ",

      "content": "I’m interested in reading philosophy but it’s unsure where to start since reading primary sources are extremely difficult, so I’m looking at better secondary interpretations of original texts to foster the hobby. I have been interested in philosophy since high school (I’m in college), but have always been too busy to look into it (it feels like I’m illiterate when I’m reading primary texts). I am interested in ethics, meaning of life, how shall one live, and maybe the philosophy behind christianity. And of course, I would also be interested in knowing more about the history of philosophy, and some of the greatest works (e.g: Plato’s republic).\nI love some beginner friendly examples! (I love deep thought and I truly believe cultivating this hobby will enrich my life so I’m really excited thanks!)",

      "content": "After the revival of metaphysics, some say that, today, philosophy of language isn't needed for researching analytic metaphysics. However, the emphasis on language in metaphysics still seems considerably more today than it was, say, in early modern metaphysics. For instance, Theodore Sider's [study](https://philpapers.org/rec/SIDWTB) revolves around how quantification (which is a logico-linguistic concept) carves at the joints of reality. Both Kit Fine and David Lewis invested immensely on similar issues.\n\n\n\nI would assume that philosophy of language is still fundamental to metaphysics because much of analytic metaphysics is Formal Ontology; the study of the formal categories of being. The emphasis is more or less structural and formal. You still don't have \"content-heavy\" metaphysics like spiritual realms of Neoplatonists or the Absolute of the Hegelians.\n\n\n\nBut I'm unsure if my assessment is correct, so: is philosophy of language fundamental for metaphysics today? can you meaningfully do metaphysics today without considerable knowledge of it?

      "title": "Lessons from Studying Philosophy at a Top University (And What I Wish I Knew)",
      "content": "Recently, I responded to a [post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/1i8g770/is_it_pointless_to_major_in_philosophy_at_this/) asking whether majoring in philosophy is still worth it. My reply seemed to resonate, but the question stuck with me--not because I doubt philosophy’s value, but because there were things I left unsaid. Things that need saying.\n\nI was a double-major at UC Berkeley, by many measures one of the top philosophy programs in the world. I took courses with faculty who’d been widely published and cited, whose names carried real weight in debates on ethics, logic, philosophy of mind, epistemology, and more. By all accounts, I was learning from the best of the best.\n\nYet the further I went, the more I felt something was missing. Not in the material itself, but in how it was taught--and how it wasn’t lived. At first, I couldn’t quite put my finger on it. There was just this slow, nagging sense that the academic practice of philosophy didn’t match what I had always imagined it to be.\n\nThat slow realization drove me to write this—not just to share what I experienced, but to offer some hard-fought advice to anyone in the field or considering it. Because if I had known back then what I know now, I would have approached both philosophy--and academia--very differently.\n\n**What I Expected vs. What I Found**\n\nI didn’t expect philosophy professors to hand us answers. I know academia has its constraints; universities are institutions first, intellectual battlegrounds second. But I believed, naïvely, that if any field would carve out space for unflinching inquiry, it would be philosophy. Out of all the disciplines, this would be the one where intellectual courage mattered.\n\nI saw philosophy as more than just a subject; it was supposed to be a way of thinking, a way of engaging with the world that demanded rigorous honesty. Professors wouldn’t just teach theories, they’d embody them, showing us how to carry the weight of what we studied.\n\nInstead, I learned that academic philosophy isn’t about the pursuit of truth; it’s about survival. It’s about learning the right terminology, structuring arguments to satisfy a grading rubric, and churning out papers that engage with the literature but rarely with reality. I soon realized the goal wasn’t necessarily to think deeply, but to perform philosophy in a way that reinforced the institution.\n\nOne moment, in particular, made this painfully clear. In an upper-level introductory class, my graduate student instructor repeatedly dismissed my writing, marking me down and insisting I didn’t understand grammar. When I pushed back—pointing out that this was how I’d been taught—she offered no real feedback, just irritation. “Get good,” essentially. Other students got the same cold detachment; I vividly remember one classmate leaving the room, hurt and furious, after getting that same “You don’t know grammar” line. It wasn’t just criticism; it was a warning: get in line, or get left behind. At the time, I couldn’t articulate exactly why this felt so wrong, but I knew, deep in my gut, that it was.\n\nYears later, I heard how David Foster Wallace approached teaching undergrads who’d been failed by the very system that was supposed to prepare them. Instead of blaming the students, he blamed the institutions. He told them to sue their school districts for letting them down. In other words, he actually cared. Because that’s what a real teacher does: sees the gap and helps you cross it, rather than sneering from the other side.\n\nAnd that was just one example. Again and again, I watched professors and GSIs, often overworked and under pressure themselves, choose rigid structure over nurturing real thought. The hard questions weren’t simply left unanswered; they were sidestepped entirely. And that’s when I realized it wasn’t just that academia failed philosophy. It failed us. It failed me. And it will fail anyone who still thinks this field is about truth.\n\n**The Institutional Reflex to Protect Itself**\n\nPhilosophy, at its core, is about truth. Relentless, uncompromising truth. It thrives on scrutiny, not convenience. But in academia, it’s no longer about truth; it’s about survival.\nI saw this firsthand. After a semester spent dissecting moral theories, I asked a professor what he actually believed. He looked uncomfortable, shifted in his chair, and answered with the careful neutrality of someone who’d long since learned to dodge:\n\n*“I don’t like to preach.”*\n\nAt the time, I felt embarrassed and ashamed, like my belt snapped and my pants dropped in front of my crush. Later, I realized it wasn’t an answer; it was an evasion. A refusal to commit, not because he lacked knowledge, but because he lacked willingness. Engagement means risk, and risk is something academia avoids at all costs.\n\nWhat does it say about a discipline built on interrogating ethics when even its leaders won’t take a stance?\n\nThis pattern wasn’t unique to philosophy. In my other major, I worked with a leading sleep researcher who studied participants in a windowless basement. I pointed out the obvious: how unnatural the setting was, how much more valuable our data could be if we used the rooms upstairs with windows. I emailed the professor. No response.\n\nMoments like that showed me how thoroughly academia demands conformity over curiosity. Don’t ask too much. Don’t threaten anyone’s position. The system doesn’t reward those who truly seek the truth; it rewards those who uphold the illusion that it’s being sought.\n\nThat’s when it hit me: I was playing the wrong game. Academia wasn’t it—it was never going to be it. The wisdom I craved wouldn’t be found in a system built to preserve itself at all costs.\n\nPhilosophy didn’t fail. The people who were supposed to uphold it did.\n\n**The Consequences of This Cowardice**\n\nWhen philosophy refuses to engage with reality, it doesn’t just lose relevance. It betrays itself. If it’s supposed to be about the pursuit of wisdom, what does it mean when the very people who teach it dodge basic moral questions? These professors spend their careers dissecting ethical frameworks and refining arguments about right and wrong, yet when asked what they actually believe, they radiate discomfort instead of confidence. The same people who train students to interrogate moral claims often refuse to take a stand themselves.\n\nAnd that raises an even more uncomfortable question: *What’s the point of a discipline if those who dedicate their lives to it won’t risk anything for it?*\n\nInstead of sharpening how people think and act, academic philosophy becomes a performance. The incentive structure is simple: publish in the right journals, cite the approved thinkers, frame your arguments so they satisfy your peers, and you’ll be rewarded. Just don’t push too far. Don’t make people uncomfortable. *Don’t take a real position.*\n\nI saw this firsthand. Bright, capable students came in wanting to wrestle with life’s biggest questions, believing—as I once did—that philosophy was about pursuing wisdom. By the time they left, something had changed. Not because the material was too difficult, but because it had become hollow. The big questions were still there, but nobody was truly engaging them.\n\nThat hollowness is the real betrayal. A discipline meant to dismantle illusions becomes an illusion of its own. A field that once demanded rigor collapses into self-referential gamesmanship. Instead of shaping people into thinkers, it conditions them to be functionaries in an academic machine built to sustain itself.\n\nSo of course professors avoid taking real stances. Of course they treat philosophy as an abstract exercise rather than a way of life. The system is designed that way. It doesn’t need truth-seekers; it needs people who can *perform* the appearance of seeking truth while keeping the machinery running.\n\nAnd that’s how philosophy—once meant to cut through illusions—turned into one of the biggest illusions of all. Because if philosophy won’t engage with reality, something else will. When rational people refuse to fight for truth, the irrational will fight for lies, and once that happens, it won’t matter what the philosophers think.\n\nHistory isn’t a story of moral progress; it’s a cycle, broken only by those willing to confront it head-on. But philosophy, the discipline meant to challenge power, became just another system justifying itself—and in doing so, it ensured its own irrelevance.\n\n**The Philosophers Who Actually Mattered Didn’t Play by These Rules**\n\nSocrates was executed. Spinoza was excommunicated. Nietzsche was dismissed as insane. Wittgenstein, frustrated by academic limits, walked away from it multiple times. None of these thinkers treated philosophy like a comfortable, tenured career path. They knew real truth demands risk, forces confrontation rather than retreat, and cannot survive where institutional safety outweighs intellectual honesty.\n\n*And yet these are the philosophers who shaped history.*\n\nContrast that with today’s philosophers—the ones who pause before saying anything too bold, too risky, too real. The ones who write papers so dense and self-referential that they alienate anyone outside academia. The ones who measure every word not for its truth, but for how colleagues—equally trained to toe the line—will receive it.\n\nIf the great philosophers of history had followed the logic of modern academia, they’d never have mattered at all. They would’ve produced well-cited, carefully neutral papers, debated politely at conferences, and retired comfortably. Their ideas would have vanished without a trace.\n\nBecause philosophy isn’t supposed to be safe. And if it is, it’s already failed.\n\n**What I Did Instead**\n\nBy my final semester, I’d already seen the cracks: evasions, polite silences, professors more interested in guarding their position than tackling real questions. Still, I held out hope that somewhere, deep in the structure of this field, the truth was waiting.\n\nOne of my last classes was on Later Wittgenstein. I’d heard he was one of the greats—the last truly relevant philosopher. Philosophical Investigations was supposedly a masterpiece of clarity, exposing the limits of language and the deep confusions baked into how we think and speak. I expected revelation. Instead, I found *despair.*\n\nI’d sit for hours in front of a blank page, my mind racing through every way a sentence could be misunderstood, every way meaning could cave in on itself. I had panic attacks over commas. I rewrote the same paragraph a dozen times, trying to convey what I actually meant—until I realized I wasn’t even sure what that was anymore. The more I pushed for clarity, the more language itself resisted.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just Wittgenstein’s ideas; it was everything that had led me to that moment. I’d already seen what happened when I asked direct questions: *'I don’t like to preach.'* I’d seen what happened when I pointed out inconvenient truths: *unease at being called 'practical.'* I’d seen what happened when I raised what I thought were minor methodological concerns—questions that should have been easy to address: *silence.*\n\nThen I heard about David Foster Wallace. He’d studied Wittgenstein too, walked the same intellectual minefield, felt the same vertigo—and emerged unscathed. He saw what Wittgenstein saw, but unlike my professors, he didn’t let it paralyze him. He didn’t let it stop him from saying something real. He took what he learned and did what none of them had the courage to do: he left philosophy. He went to literature. Because philosophy, as academia practiced it, was too cautious, too self-protective—too afraid to commit to saying something that actually mattered.\n\nThat’s when I realized: real thinkers don’t just theorize about truth. They risk something for it.\n\n**Where I Actually Found Philosophy**\n\nI found it in literature, in the minds of people who didn’t just analyze reality from a safe distance but wrestled with it; who saw clearly and spoke plainly, even when it cost them.\n\nI found it in David Foster Wallace, who understood alienation so precisely that reading him felt like having your mind flayed open, every modern contradiction laid bare. He refused academic riddles, writing with clarity because he *wanted* to be understood, and never hiding behind neutrality.\n\nI found it in Jonathan Franzen, who didn’t just critique the world’s failures but exposed them. Relentlessly, unsparingly. He dissected self-deception, ideological purity, and the quiet betrayals people commit every day. He didn’t just analyze human nature; he forced you to confront it.\n\nI found it in Attack on Titan by Hajime Isayama. A story that refused to lie or comfort its audience. A story that made you sit with the weight of history, the inevitability of cycles, the hard truth that knowing better isn’t always enough. A story that forced you to see yourself not just in the heroes, but in the followers and justifiers who keep the system running because it’s easier than fighting it.\n\nAnd it wasn’t just them. Didion, Orwell, Saunders, Zadie Smith—writers who stripped away illusions in different ways, who saw that literature wasn’t just about telling stories but about telling the truth in the only way people might hear it.\n\nI found more truth in their words than in all the seminars, lectures, and carefully footnoted journal articles written for an audience of ten.\n\nBut more than that, I found something else: I realized philosophy—if it has any worth—must be lived, not just studied. It isn’t a set of theories to memorize, a career path, or a game where you score points for citing the right thinkers. It’s a weapon, a tool, a way of cutting through noise, of seeing the machinery behind the world, of noticing when people lie—to others or to themselves. Most importantly, it’s something you have to act on.\n\nBecause knowing the truth is meaningless if you never use it.\n\nAll those logic exercises—truth tables, logic trees, validity, and soundness—are meaningless if you don’t apply them in real life. Because in the real world, nobody hands you a neatly structured argument with premises labeled P1, P2, and P3. Nobody pauses to ask if their reasoning is sound. People will lie, sometimes without realizing it; institutions will justify contradictions and call it policy. Entire systems will operate on bad logic, but as long as they produce the right results for the right people, nobody questions them.\n\nSo what’s the point of deconstructing an argument if you won’t do it when it matters? What’s the point of years of training in formal reasoning if, when confronted with real-world contradictions, you look away?\n\nPhilosophy teaches you how to think. *It’s on you to do something with it.*\n\n**From Me, To Me and You, Ten Years Ago**\n\n* To the professors and grad students who recognize themselves in this\n\nIf you can’t acknowledge real engagement—if you silence deep questions rather than encourage them, if your first instinct when confronted with discomfort is self-preservation—then what exactly are you doing? What is your purpose?\n\nYou were supposed to be the stewards of this discipline. The ones who defended philosophy not just as an academic field, but as a way of life. You were meant to sharpen minds, not dull them into submission. And if you’ve ever felt that flicker of dissatisfaction, that quiet, gnawing sense that something is off—that the field you love has become something smaller than it was meant to be—then ask yourself, honestly: *What would it take for you to be the kind of teacher you once needed?*\n\nI already know the defenses you’ll reach for: that I don’t understand how academia works, that avoiding personal stances isn’t cowardice but professional necessity, that philosophy is about arguments, not beliefs, that a professor’s job is to guide students, not tell them what to think. I get all of that. Truly.\n\nBut here’s the thing: If philosophy isn’t meant to mean something—if it isn’t meant to shape how we see, act, and live—then what exactly is the point? If the best minds in this field, the ones who dedicate their lives to studying truth, won’t risk anything for it—what are they even doing?\n\nAnd if you, reading this, felt even a flicker of recognition—even a second of discomfort at what I’ve written—then you already know the answer.\n\n* Acknowledging the Good Ones\n\nNot everyone was complicit. Some of you tried to make a real difference, to see students as thinkers rather than cogs. I remember a GSI who stumbled over his words while trying to offer me genuine encouragement, despite the institutional pressure weighing him down. He knew the system was broken—and even if he couldn’t fully escape it, he did what he could. If you’re one of those people, please understand: none of this is meant to lump you in with the rest. I only wish there were more of you.\n\n* To the students who are interested in studying academic philosophy\n\nIt is immensely valuable; but only if you treat it as a tool, not a religion. Use it to see clearly. Use it to act. Theories mean nothing if they don’t sharpen your ability to navigate the world, to make sense of contradictions, to move through life without getting trapped by easy answers.\n\nIf your professors won’t guide you, find your own mentors. Read the ones who aren’t safely dead. Read Wallace. Read Franzen. Read Isayama. Read Orwell, Didion, Saunders, Zadie Smith—the ones who don’t just write philosophy but live it. Because the truth is out there. It always has been.\n\n* And finally, to whoever is still reading\n\nThis isn’t bitterness. It’s not a petty takedown of academia or a performance of disillusionment. It’s what happens when you take philosophy seriously: you cut through polite evasions, say the quiet part out loud, and risk something. I say this because I know I’m not the only one who felt this way. If you’re honest, maybe you’ve felt it too.\nSo this is me being the person I wish had been there for me. And if you’re a professor or a grad student reading this, maybe this is me being the person you wish had been there for you, too. Because I realized I had no other choice. Because at the end of the day, **somebody has to do it.**\n\n**A Rumbling You Can’t Ignore**\n\nThe world is moving. The ground under your feet is shifting. The institutions you thought would always be there? Dismantled. The systems you believed would protect you? Hijacked. The warnings you once dismissed as paranoia? Happening in real time.\n\nPhilosophy, at its best, is supposed to prepare us for this—to give us the tools to see clearly, to recognize patterns, to cut through the lies before they become something worse. But what happens when the very people entrusted with this responsibility retreat instead of confront? When they choose safety over truth? When they perform the rituals of intellectualism while the world outside burns?\n\nLook at what’s happening right now. The authoritarian playbook is unfolding step by step, right in front of us. Institutions gutted, not by accident but by design. The Department of Education? Dragged out back. USAID? Hollowed out. Treasury data? Handed over to unelected billionaires. Federal agencies repurposed to serve private interests. Laws rewritten to consolidate power and punish dissent, turning democracy into a shell of itself.\n\nThe people who spent years discussing the fragility of democratic institutions, who wrote papers on authoritarian creep and the erosion of rights—where are they now? Are they using their knowledge and influence to sound the alarm? Or are they sitting in offices, refining arguments for an audience of ten, murmuring, *“I don’t like to preach.”*\n\nThe consequences of intellectual cowardice aren’t theoretical anymore. They’re here. Now. This was never an abstract debate. The question was always whether people would recognize the danger before it was too late—whether those who claim to value truth would stand by it when it mattered.\n\nThere’s no running from this. No amount of detachment or neutrality can insulate you. The world is changing whether you engage with it or not, and you have a choice:\n\nLook away. Pretend it isn’t happening, tell yourself philosophy is just an academic exercise, that you have no obligation to act. Or face it.\n\nBecause the real test of whether philosophy matters isn’t in a seminar room. It’s here. It’s now. And there is no neutrality in a moment like this.",

In short, Hegel's criticism of Kant (which lies in Kant's idea of subjective-objectivity in aesthetic judgment), and his eventual solution, is internally inconsistent and self-contradictory. I am seeking feedback/advice on publishing this in a philosophy journal.\n\nHegel says, \"But this apparently perfect reconciliation is still supposed by Kant at the last to be only subjective in respect of the judgement and the production \\[of art\\], and not itself to be absolutely true and actual.\"\n\n&\n\n\"These we may take to be the chief results of Kant's Critique of Judgment in so far as they can interest us here. His Critique constitutes the starting point for the true comprehension of the beauty of art, yet only by overcoming Kant's deficiencies could this comprehension assert itself as the higher grasp of the true unity of necessity and freedom, particular and universal, sense and reason.\"\n\nI touch on the work of various contemporary academic philosophers (Hegel and Kant scholars) including: Richard Eldridge, Paul Guyer, James Kirwan, Georg Luckas, Jessica Williams, and Lambert Zuidervaart.",

      "content": "I've been working on a philosophical investigation that points to something more fundamental than both Whitehead's \"creative advance\" and Henry's \"self-manifestation of Life.\" I'd appreciate engagement and discussion from those familiar with either thinker.\n\nThe core insight emerged through examining the relationship between logic, existence, and philosophical questioning. While both Whitehead and Henry attempted to articulate something prior to the subject-object split, this investigation reveals something even more fundamental - that which precedes not only consciousness and being, but existence itself.\n\nKey aspects:\n\n1. It cannot be directly described (as description would make it an object), yet can be indicated through philosophical questioning\n2. It precedes logic while enabling logical thought\n3. It's neither ineffable (since it can be pointed to) nor effable (since it resists description)\n4. It manifests through the very act of questioning about it\n\nThis differs from:\n\n* Whitehead's attempt to systematize the ground of process\n* Henry's phenomenological investigation of life's self-manifestation\n\nQuestions for discussion:\n\n1. How does this relate to your reading of Process and Reality?\n2. For those familiar with Henry's work, how does this compare to his notion of auto-affection?\n3. What are the implications for philosophical methodology if something preceding existence can be indicated but not described?\n\nI'm particularly interested in:\n\n* Methodological insights about investigating what precedes investigation\n* Comparisons with other philosophical approaches to what precedes the subject-object split\n* Thoughts on the relationship between questioning and what can't be described\n\nNote: This isn't mysticism or pure negativity - it's an attempt to carefully examine what enables philosophical investigation itself while acknowledging the unique challenges this poses.\n\nLooking forward to thoughtful engagement and discussion.",

I’ve always had a rather analytical view on life, I value the study of ethics and morals, and sometimes I thrive off of  existential questions. Has anyone made a career change like this? If anybody who is studying philosophy could tell me their experience, if it’s what you thought it would be, job opportunities, and any changes you’d make if you could? If I choose to study philosophy, my first career choice would be a professor. I’ve always known from a young age I wanted to be an educator. Appreciative any help. Thanks.",

      "content": "Hello. I am in my late twenties and am in the process of applying for school in hopes of getting a philosophy degree, which I understand is the ideal undergraduate degree leading into law school. After pissing away most of my early 20s working in restaurants and cheating death, I am now in my late 20s. I stumbled across the fact that a higher percentage of lawyers have ADHD compared to the rest of the population (12 percent of lawyers to 4-6 percent of the general population). As I continued to research, I found that philosophy undergraduates and law school students alike need to have strong writing skills and the ability to think in abstract ways, two things I did well in during my high school days. I come from a strong blue collar background and know very little of the collegiate world. I think it would be best to list my concerns and have those who are willing respond to them. I am single and do not have children. I would love to hear from those that decided to pursue a philosophy degree later in life, or as a non-traditional student.\n\n1.) I am poor. Is there anything that could keep me from making the jump from community college to a university to law school? Speaking from a financial aid/loan perspective. My fear there is getting an undergraduate degree and being unable to afford law school. I'm willing to take out whatever loans are necessary but my credit is awful and I'm already barely making ends meet.\n\n2.) It's been quite some time since I wrote a paper or read an extensive book. I've spent my time after graduation in restaurants, not exactly the most mentally stimulating job but I do feel that my time serving and cooking has conditioned me to handle stress well. For those of you that went back to school later in life, did you feel like you were able to \"tap in\" to those writing skills again?\n\n3.) Philosophy is hard. I took the first philosophy class (1301?) at 19 for the one year of school I did complete, and through my weedy, hazy, fogged out brain I think I scraped together a 2.8. Now that I'm sober, I know I can do better, but what qualities would make for a strong GPA in this field? I'm open to other undergraduate programs, but I know philosophy is ideal to become a lawyer.\n\nThank you for your time and responses.",

However, I'm perplexed why it seems that many historians of philosophy present their works as contributing invaluable arguments for contemporary philosophy debates. More perplexing why it seems many historians of philosophy insist on fixing apparent contradictions within their respective philosophers' works, instead of assuming it was simply inevitable human error, especially erroes that seems so to the modern reader (such as Hegel's metaphysical Spirit being spooky for 21st rather than 19st century). This adds to my former idea that it seems they're trying to present some underlaying, perennial philosophy.\n\nPerhaps there's something I don't understand within the discipline of History of Philosophy?

      "title": "How do I regain my interest in philosophy?",
      "content": "In highschool, I was always interested in philosophy. More specifically, I was interested in questions related to how do we obtain knowledge, what is criteria for truth, what is consciousness, what constitutes art, etc. Thus, when I moved on to university I chose to major in philosophy. However, after studying philosophy for 4 years, I have slowly started to hate philosophy for various reasons:\n\n1. Philosophy never gives me any concrete answers. Everything I have learned from taking philosophy classes has taught me that I can never definitively answer the questions I have sought to answer. Everything I have read has had counter-argument after counter-argument, attacking either the premises, the justifications or the conclusions. Whenever a philosophy-related debate ensues with my friends, I always end up being a \"fence-sitter\" and saying stuff like \"while some people believe x, other people claim y,\" and I never have a definitive opinion on anything. While I understand this is kind of the point of philosophy, it leaves me very unsatisfied, and it makes me feel like I haven't really learned anything from my classes. Whenever I write an essay, I never fully agree with the position I take, I simply choose the side that seems easier to write about. Without definitive answers, to me, it feels like philosophy is just intellectual circle-jerking.\n2. I never feel like I'm synthesizing my own ideas. Whenever I write a philosophy paper, I simply just read a bunch of sources related to my thesis and add them together. When I want to defend x, I write \"well, y said z, and z is similar enough to x for so and so reasons, so we must accept x.\" The most synthesis of ideas I am doing is drawing pretty trivial connections between stuff I have already read, and I never feel like anything I write is novel, or that I even own the ideas that I write about. All these rules like \"we require n citations\" and \"you must include these sources\" make me feel like I'm not allowed think on my own or be creative in my own right. In the end, I feel like I'm just summarizing the ideas of others. While I would like to believe that a real philosopher, at one point, may eventually be able to create their own ideas, I can't see myself doing that in the foreseeable future, especially at the undergrad level.\n3. I do not feel very connected to other philosophy students. From the points above, I have been starting to loath a lot of the philosophy classes that I have been in. But for some reason, most other philosophy students I have talked to enjoyed the philosophy courses that I have hated. However, for the philosophy classes that I did enjoy, the class sizes were abysmally small, and most other philosophy students that I have talked to either didn't care for them or actively disliked them. For example, the classes that I enjoyed the most were ones related to logic, model theory, set theory or topos theory (mostly because I avoided running into problems 1 and 2 in these classes). However, its very rare for me to find any philosophy students interested in these topics. I go to a large university, yet I feel very isolated from my peers. This lack of support from other students is probably a main factor into why I don't feel motivated to study philosophy.\n\nMy main question is: How do I remedy these problems and become interested in philosophy again? Should I just jump ship and abandon philosophy because my problems are irreconcilable? Any advice would be appreciated",

Will doing my PhD in the Netherlands, rather than in the US/UK, hinder what slim chances I have of finding a job in academia after?\n\nMy goal is to teach and research philosophy at a university level, for a living. It doesn't have to be at a prestigious university, and I have no intention of being an academic superstar. I just want to make a decent wage, doing what I love, in a country that isn't falling apart. I realise this is a pretty ambitious dream.\n\nI know the job market is really bad. I've heard that getting a PhD from a world renowned university, like Princeton or NYU, won't guarantee a job after, but it could help. However, that means living in the US; it's not horrible, but it's not something I'm hoping for. In the UK stipends are really bad.\n\nIn the Netherlands PhDs are hired employees, with a good wage and workers rights. Generally, it seems like a good place to live, if you can find housing. However, I'm worried that a PhD from a top university there, like Rotterdam or Utrecht, won't be held in high regard in the anglosphere where most positions are, and might even hurt my chances of finding a job or even a postdoc position. \n\nSo, returning to the question at the top - will a PhD from the Netherlands hurt my chances of achieving my goal?\n\nAll thoughts would be really appreciated.

      "content": "So this isn't academic philosophy in content but arises constantly with my experience in academic philosophy. I'm a 1st year PhD student in philosophy program for context. \n\n\nI am writing this directly after listening to a university presentation. I consistently struggle with imposter syndrome to the point where after I leave academic philosophy settings my imposter syndrome, anxiety, self-doubt -whatever you want to call it - is so severe I feel paralyzed, shakey, nausea, and have the urge to vomit. I used to never be this way. And I ask people about how to deal with these issues, and I consistently get \"just recognize that everyone has this,\" or  \"your more capable than you think you are\" etc. But this doesn't help me. I try to reason through my self-judgments and work out how they do not entail how I should feel, etc. \n\nThis often stems from the fact that I am so caught up in my head during academic engagements about being insightful or asking good questions or remembering material, the usual requirements of being a good philosopher, that I cannot escape the despair of feeling like I cannot do any of this. I constantly have this feeling like \"don't mess up.\" This feeling prevents me from succeeding and typically causes me to mess up.\n\nI honestly feel so debilitated by this that I get extremely depressed and don't even want to read philosophy some days simply because of my self-doubt. Which is sad, because I love this topic. \n\nI never had an ounce of these feelings until I got into grad school. I spent a long time working through them after my master's, and I got into my PhD, and they have reared their ugly head again. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? What is your advice? What worked for you? ",

      "title": "What's the point of history of science?",
      "content": "I am a PhD student in the history of science, and it seems like I'm getting a bit burned out with it. I do absolutely love history and philosophy of science. And I do think it is important to have professionals working on the emergence of modern science. Not just for historical awareness, but also for current and future scientific developments, and for insight into how humans generate knowledge and deal with nature.\n\nHowever, the sheer number of publications on early modern science sometimes just seems absurd. Especially the ones that deal with technical details. Do we need yet another book about some part of Newton's or Descartes' methodology? Or another work about a minor figure in the history of science? I'm not going to name names, but I have read so many books and articles about Newton by now, and there have been several, extremely detailed studies that, at least to me, have actually very little to contribute.\n\nI understand that previous works can be updated, previous ideas critically examined. But it seems that the publications of the past decade or two are just nuancing previous ideas. And I mean nuancing the tiniest details that sometimes leads me to think you can never say anything general about the history of science. Historian A says that we can make a generalisation, so we can understand certain developments (for instance the emergence of experimentalism). Then Historian B says it is more complicated than that. And by now Historian C and D are just arguing over tiny details of those nuances. But the point Historian A made often still seems valid to me. Now there is just a few hundred or thousand pages extra of academic blather behind it.\n\nFurthermore, nobody reads this stuff. You're writing for a few hundred people around the world who also write about the same stuff. Almost none of it gets incorporated into a broader idea of science, or history. And any time someone writes a more general approach, someone trying to get away from endless discussions of tiny details, they are not deemed serious philosophers. Everything you write or do just keeps floating around the same little bubble of people. I know this is a part of any type of specialised academic activity, but it seems that the history of philosophy texts of the past two decades have changed pretty much nothing in the field. And yet there have been hundreds of articles and books.\n\nAnd I'm sick and tired of the sentence \"gives us more insight into ...\". You can say this before any paper you write. What does this \"insight\" actually mean? Is it useful to have more and more (ad nauseam) insight into previous scientific theories? Is that even possible? Do these detailed studies actually give more insight? Or is it eventually just the idiosyncratic view and understanding of the researcher writing the paper?\n\nSorry for the rant, but it really sucks that the field that at first seemed so exciting, now sometimes just seems like a boring club of academics milking historical figures in order to publicise stuff that will only ever be read by that very same club. And getting money for your research group of course. And it's very difficult to talk to my colleagues or professors about this, since they are exactly part of the club that I am annoyed with.\n\nI'm interested in the thoughts you guys have about this. Is any historian of science dealing with the same issues? And how does the field look to an outsider?",

Now, I want to return and finish but it's been almost a decade since I have taken a philosophy course. My goal--god willing--is to teach philosophy or a related discipline at the community college level. I truly believe that the study of philosophy is important for humanity.\n \n I know the job prospects look absolutely grim. I know that my family and friends are gonna question me every step of the way. And I know I could end up working the same jobs I would have without a degree.\n\n But, coming from an underprivileged background and a minority( parents didn't graduate highschool, first generation, poor socio-economics) it would honestly give me a sense of pride to  finish some serious academic work. I will finish a masters but not too sure about doctorate. I've been a great student in the philosophy classes I took with nearly all As. \n I enrolled in a not highly ranked but cheap and close by university. The philosophy program is decent. It's definitely focused on the analytical tradition with wide sweeping courses like Philosophy of Science or American Philosophy and no courses on specific philosophers. I fear that being a person who has interest in German Idealism and Romanticism that I will not be studying too much of what I enjoy reading on my own. Although, I think it will be helpful for me to regularly encounter positions contrary to my beliefs.\n \n For the next five months before the semester begins I plan to refresh my knowledge on logic (I am working through The Logic Book by Bergmann, Moor, and Nelson) and pick a few shorter philosophical works that I can write on. I was also thinking about learning how to read German. I know in my graduate studies I will be given the opportunity to learn. Couldn't hurt to start early right? \n   It's time I put all my effort into something and see what the outcome could be. Possibly I won't have the opportunity to be a PHD student working on German Idealism. More likely than not! Perhaps I'll get into an industry that I'd never imagine I would work in. I have the interest in this and the passion that I think pursuing this could be a risk worth taking. I hope not too take out many loans. And the BA will be mostly paid for. \n\nThanks for reading!\n  ",

I've already passed my proposal defense, so I have a topic and committee already picked out, as well as a (at least temporary) structure to my dissertation. Despite this, I'm having a hard time figuring out how to write chapter 1. Because of the huge amount of research/source integration I'm expected to have, approaching it like a traditional term paper is proving unsuccessful -- I feel like as I add more sources, I am straying further from the argument and creating some massive, incoherent document (e.g., \"This person said this. And this other person said this. But I think those are wrong for X,Y,Z. But this other person said this!\"... ad infinitum). But, I know that I need to incorporate the literature -- otherwise, it wouldn't be a successful research project. \n\nSo my question ultimately is -- how did you (or those you know) deal with this? Does anyone have best practices they recommend for literature incorporation, or the early drafting stages? I'm currently using Zotero to organize papers I found/am reading, but that feels less helpful for writing than it is for referencing. Time management/scheduling tips are also welcome, as I currently work a separate job 20hr/wk that can make task switching difficult.",

      "content": "In May I completed my first year of a two-year master's program in Philosophy. My undergraduate degree was in the same. But recently I find myself losing my passion for philosophy. I used to think about philosophy constantly. But right now I feel as if can barely care about it. It all seems lifeless, pointless and a chore. \n\nI'm not sure if something is clouding my judgement, if the department isn't a good fit for me, or if philosophy itself isn't for me. The department is Analytic in nature, so I've been looking at PhD. programs in continental programs as well as programs in other departments (English, political science, etc.) I've also considered taking a break from school after the master's to sort my sh\\*t out. Does anyone have any advice on this matter? ",

I will be teaching philosophy for at least two, no homework allowed. I have a master's degree in comparative literature with two semesters of philosophy courses along the way, but no experience with teaching. \n\nI am currently thinking that the greeks are going to be the most approachable option, especially when taking the school's \"no homework\" rule into account. The school culture seems very improvisational and focused on fun activities. I have a hunch that Crash Course could be a good resource on YouTube, and I know I'd like to do a read-through of Epicurus' Letter to Menoeceus in class at some point, since I wrote a paper on it at uni and generally find his short ethics quite appealing and easy to spark discussion with. \n\nAll advice and thoughts are very welcome!

I had a question about what counts as academics in philosophy. I don't know whether philosophy is taught in high schools outside India, but here philosophy is not a subject for high school students. I wonder what would count as my academic performance if I wanted to apply for philosophy. My grades in other subjects or something else? What do universities look for in philosophy students? I currently have Political Science, Sociology, CS and AI as my subjects. \n\nI also wanted to know the internet's opinion on what extracurriculars would be beneficial for my application. One of my teachers told me that learning a new language or improving my writing skills ( getting essays published and writing for newspapers etc ) would help my application. I want to know your opinion on this. I am looking to apply to universities based in the UK. \n\nAre there any other resources/opportunities that I can look out for?\n\nThanks.",

Philosophy will never have a bigger audience than say entertainment, literature, or practical political commentary. Even if you managed to have an audience, it’s getting near impossible to get a full grasp of what one scholar is trying to say, even within the tiny specialized circle, because philosophy is getting more subdivided everyday. Meaning just because you’re a great Heidegger scholar doesn’t mean you appeal to all Heidegger fans in the world & it’s not easy to be a great Heidegger scholar if you’ve devoted your whole life. (Not to mention there aren’t that many Heidegger fans in the world to begin with)\n\nSo is philosophy, at the end of the day, for the scholar’s personal satisfaction? Is it not then a mere extension of self-improvement or some New Age practice? Have you ever questioned whether or not it’d be worthwhile if there won’t be much “impact” made from your writings? How does a theoretical philosopher today make of their own existential status? What regardless keeps you go on?",

How often do you meet with your advisor? I'm new in the department and surely I have a lot to discuss with my advisor right now.

      "content": "Hello\n\nI don't know if this is the right place to put this, but reckoned it makes more sense here than anywhere else I can think of. I'll try to be as succinct as possible; I'm an undergrad in philosophy, returning to put the last few finishing touches on my degree after having to take a break for a few years due to some life circumstances. I've been intending to continue my education in philosophy, and am just getting my applications to grad schools sorted now. Unfortunately, I just became rather uncertain about the whole affair.  \n\nI received an email a few weeks ago about some volunteering opportunities for a large philosophy conference in my city, and decided to sign up, just getting done with my first volunteer shift yesterday, and also getting the chance to catch a few talks. And...it was terrible. The single word that kept popping up in my head was 'anemic' - hundreds of people, talking about problems that were interesting thirty to forty years ago, but have since then been beaten into the dust. Or, alternatively, folks constructing such bizarrely baroque and hyper specific models and arguments, for seemingly no purpose (not even the seeming pleasure of making the argument! No one seemed like they were enjoying explaining their positions, more they were just obligated to do it and couldn't care either way) beyond publishing demands. And all of it suffused with this air of extreme opportunism and pettiness, where folks seemed to be just waiting for someone to screw up in their talk or with a question so they could quickly shoot them down.\n\nI get that academic philosophy, and the academic world in general, is part of the corporate world (as much as it likes to position itself as it's opposite) and it's got all of the banalities and idiocies that run through corporate culture, on top of some of its own. I spent a few years working in the corporate world, and I've never been under any illusions that academia was somehow spared from the eternal grudge matches and squabbling, that it stayed as some kind of bastion of goodness against the *evuhhlls* of the world or something. But I can't deny that after walking out of the conference (which I still have to return to tomorrow), I immediately got hit with an overwhelming sensation that I've made a huge mistake in studying philosophy, and having an immediate desire to just get as far away from it as possible. Which is a pity, because I love philosophy, reading it, writing it, and especially discussing it with people. For a long time, it's what I was absolutely certain I would wind up doing. And while I admit this is probably only a momentary, and necessary, questioning of that career track that I'll get over in a month or so....I dunno.\n\nHas anyone else had this experience with philosophy conferences, or just certain aspects of academic philosophy in general?

      "title": "A possible reason as to why Philosophy of Architecture has been neglected (also help and advice appreciated).",
      "content": "I am looking into getting formal education in philosophy through a masters in philosophy of architecture after finishing my architecture grad, specially because the area of philosophy of architecture has been neglected. Before asking for advice I need to preface why academic production in philosophy of architecture is uniquely difficult and not comparable to other fields.  \n\n\n I suspect one of the reasons for that is that knowledge of architectural principles only are experienced and understood through formal education in architecture, its a technical time consuming and expensive major. Those who have that formal understanding of architectural principles frequently instantly go into the job market to get their time's worth out of the profession.  It takes an average 11 years to become licensed architects with independent or contracted practices within the industry (according to NCARB). The individuals who have the most practical and technical knowledge of architecture are working architects, they usually have not only spent tens of thousands of dolars on formal education but also a significant chunk of their life through years of internships and developing technical skills in softwares, networking, further education and managing skills to deal with people and money (because at the end of the day, architecture today is a product and a business which is bought by clients).  \n\n\nThat appears to be why there is a lack of philosophical production in architecture. After spending so much time getting an education in a profession which is extremely stressfull, competitive and hostile there seems to be little wiggle room for philosophy. Specially that the monetary compensation of architects is already extremely disproportionate to the time and effort it takes to get licensed, from a survival point of view there is little point in academic production in architecture when academic life does not equal monetary success (which is a real determining factor in pursuing any form of education).    \n\n\nSeeing that, I'm not surprised there is little academic production in philosophy of architecture, when you are already struggling to make ends meet with insane hours in a profession that you dedicated a serious ammount of time to, going into academic philosophy might be digging yourself into a hole, there is no guarantee its going to have an immediate effect on the architecture field, it seems quite useless from an architects perspective.\n\n  That in my opinion is a problem, and probably the reason as to why there is a lack of philosophical production of architecture throughout history, the knowledge of aspects of architecture that are the most important to its philosophical discussion and ontological status are held by those who have a formal education in it, and those individuals have typically spent their lives in the profession and not in philosophical study of those very concepts. Philosophers who dabble in architecture might be able to derive understanding of these concepts but because they are dependent on the experience of creating architecture to perceive these concepts, they cannot produce meaningful discussion that is pertinent to the field, the industry or the future production of architecture. It is philosophically stagnant\n\n\nThis is the very first paragraph in the Philosophy of Architecture entry in Stanford Enciclopedia of Philosophy:   \n\n\n *\"Over the course of Western philosophy, including the history of aesthetics, architecture has largely failed to attract sustained, detailed attention—particularly as compared with other artforms. Neither philosophical issues prompted by architecture, nor the fit of architectural phenomena into larger philosophical debates, have captured the philosophical imagination as have, for example, literature or painting. Some contributions across the span of Western philosophy—including those of Wolff and Schopenhauer—rank as historically significant; other, more recent accounts are broad-ranging and gravid with conceptual concerns, including those of Scruton and Harries. Further, some philosophers have even dabbled in architectural projects: Dewey contributed to plans for the Chicago Laboratory School, Wittgenstein collaborated on designing a house for his sister, and Bentham sketched the Panopticon design as a plan for prison reform. Yet the overall state of philosophical reflection on architecture—even in the present day—is less lively than like discussions focused on artforms of far more recent origin, such as film or comics.\"*   \n\n\n Philosophy of science has a huge amount of writers that beside philosophers are also mathematicians, physicists, etc. Philosophy of Mind has writers that are neuropsychologists, Philosophy of Art has art historians and working artists.   \n  Philosophy of Architecture has very fiew architects, \\*very\\* few architects. Christopher Wolff, not an architect; Schopenhaurer, not an architect; Scruton, not an architect; Wittgenstein, not an architect. So on and so on.  \n\n\n  I am planning on doing a master's degree in philosophy of architecture after college, but I dont know how that might be feasible seeing that I would need significant study in academic philosophy before attempting that, however I do think its important to try, how could I go about studying philosophy on my own so i can reach a place that will prepare me adequately to a masters, and is doing a masters while working full time even possible?",

My partner is presenting their diss at a conference so I suppose it's not impossible.\n\nI'd also not like to put too much on their plate as I know how busy academics are, so would it be realistic to redraft it for a journal on my own?",

      "content": "I struggle with grading and am very slow at it.\n\nMy first issue is that it's hard to assign something as qualitative as an essay an ordinal ranking. When I'm reading an undergrad essay, I think \"Hmm, it does this thing well, it's okay at that, it's pretty shitty at this,\" and it seems pretty arbitrary to convert this qualitative assessment a letter grade. I'm not confident that I wouldn't give the same essay two different grades on different days based on what I had for breakfast that morning. Obviously, an A paper is clearly different from a C paper, but I cannot tell you how I decide where something is an A- or a B+.\n\nMy second issue is speed/efficiency. When I tell people I study philosophy, they go \"wow, you must have to read some difficult texts.\" And I go, \"if I do, it's rare that I have to do this in my own studies.\" Because if I'm reading published books and articles, I'm likely reading things written by people who are skilled at and experienced in writing. The reading I have to do as part of _grading_ though, is a different story. Undergrad writing is not written by people who have built up the skill of making reading easy for the reader. I have to read it more slowly than I do good writing. I have to double back and retrace my steps. I can't just glean the information through skimming, because I might miss information that is crucial to the evaluation of the essay. Everybody says \"you need to be less charitable and just assume that if you didn't understand it the first time, the student failed to be clear enough.\" But invariably what happens when I try this approach is that anything I miss is quite obvious upon a second reading when pointed out to me by the upset student. In which case, it's hard to defend my inability to understand as being the fault of the writer.\n\nBut I need to find a way to go faster. I can't keep on spending a whole-ass hour on a single essay when I've got 100 of them to grade.\n\nDoes anybody have any tips?",

      "title": "How belief in the unknown guides moral action - a response to Clifford's 'Ethics of Belief'",
      "content": " \n\nSince the enlightenment’s recognition that our actions play out in objective reality according to natural laws, science has rightly claimed ownership over that domain of knowledge. And it’s true that any good decision-maker will work to understand the evidence for and against their beliefs and weigh them accordingly, improving the likelihood their action will lead to their desired outcome. But Western thinking has gone too far in reducing the function of belief to pure observation and reason.  \n\nIn *‘Ethics of Belief*’, W.K. Clifford argues that it is morally “wrong everywhere and for anyone, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence”. The claim is that the only moral beliefs are ones that are backed up by some standard of proof.  This concept has been a cornerstone of 20th century Western rationalism since the *Ethics of Belief*’s publication in 1901, and I suspect is an overreaction to the historical dominance of religious thought up to that point.\n\nI dispute Clifford's strict limitation on acceptable moral beliefs, on the basis that with our most fundamental beliefs - the ones closest to our core assumptions about the nature of reality - both the less sure we can be of our accuracy *and* the more influence they have on our moral reasoning.  These ‘ontological beliefs’ include the nature of physical reality, consciousness, free will, the existence of God or a higher power, and our interpretations of other people’s state of mind. The truths of these matters are largely unknown, and by some accounts unknowable, yet they are fundamental components of moral decision-making.\n\nTake for example nihilism: nihilists reject the assumption that there is value to the human experience.  On that basis we cannot build any moral judgments at all. All decent moral claims rest on a belief that others have personal experience similar to our own, and that those experiences matter. But some would argue that these claims cannot be proven, because they are not verifiable beyond our individual perspective.\n\nEven after granting those assumptions, for morality to get off the ground, we must also believe that it’s possible to make a positive impact on the world, and that others won’t tear down the progress we make. Otherwise there would be no reason for us to make a personal contribution in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, we must believe that collaboration with others can be ‘positive-sum’ - that it can generate incremental value compared with acting alone - else we will run into significant moral difficulties in situations where resources are fixed.  Now that there are no geographical frontiers left to exploit, we are faced with a choice: either work together to grow the size of the pie with the resources we have, or face the realities of a zero-sum world - where the only way to increase our personal share is to take another’s piece. Unless we want to gamble that the entire world will somehow accept that they’ve had their fill, we best believe in the possibility of fruitful collaborative effort.  \n\nAs such, having faith in ourselves, our spouses, and our neighbours is a *necessary condition* for moral progress. And this is the case *even if* that faith is built on shaky ground. \n\nWhile I agree with Clifford that, in the realm of the knowable, we should only believe what is evident. But when it comes to the unknowable, we must fill in the gaps of reason with moral beliefs.\n\nInstead, I propose that there are beliefs that we are *morally obliged* to hold, *regardless* of the level of confidence one might have that they’re objectively true. These beliefs are centered around the expectations we have for our own contribution to the world and how others will engage our efforts. Put simply: to act morally, we must believe in the possibility of a better future. \n\n\\--------\n\nFeedback, critiques and arguments are welcome.

A text will be judged, appreciated, by the power and prestige held by the author, not by its ideas in themselves. This makes it very difficult to produce new ideas, because, in general, almost nothing is established absolutely, mathematically, in philosophy. In this sense, I end up spending most of my time looking for fragments of other famous, renowned thinkers and researchers, rather than establishing my own ideas. It is as if this, and only this, validates them.

The presenter's paper consisted of several misinterpretations, terminological misunderstandings, and false attributions which would have been obvious to anyone who read the book in full. X for example clearly distinguished between 3 philosophical concepts, but the presenter made it look like there were only two. When i asked about the missing third concept, the presenter falsely claimed that X never talked about this third distinction in the book. The presenter was basically attacking a strawman version of the book's argument.  It seems that I was reading a term paper from a survey course where the presenter had only read the selected bits from the course syllabus.\n\nI pointed those errors and terminological misunderstandings out, but I felt that my comments were not well-received.

      "content": "I know I know I don’t need her approval, but she screamed at me over the phone for 50 minutes when I told her I am pursuing a philosophy PHD at Northwestern. She’s says I’m wasting the connections that got me in, she’s says I’m never going to have a job and I’m wasting my life. A lot of her frustration comes is abt what she hears from aunt and uncle, both humanities phd’s teaching at George Mason, who are constantly having to fire people. However the private liberal arts school I am graduating from has hired 15+ new faculty members since I started here, and many of them are alumni’s. I met with the career counselor here that said I seem like the perfect fit, and pursuing a PhD is a great way to get fast tracked to a professor or research position. Any thoughts? Any helpful data? I know the market for it is shit and that’s all my grandma cares about, but all my advisors and mentors at this school have told me to do so, and are very supportive.",

      "content": "So, I just transferred from a pretty lowscale community polytechnic to a bigger university. The philosophy classes at the other school were exceptionally easy, but I've been sort of shellshocked at the classes I'm currently doing. At my old school I was published in a journal, presented at a conference, received a memorial scholarship & got dean's list honours both years.\n\nAll of this is to say that I've officially \"shat the bed\" on my first assignment (a paper on Hume worth 25% of the course grade) and I feel miserable about it. I handed it in late and have emailed the professor about that dimension of it but furthermore (and the real problem) was that I didn't use my time effectively and wrote a really mediocre paper. I'm quite ashamed, but I wanted to know if this sort of thing will at all impact my chances of grad school? I feel like a country bumpkin making first year mistakes in my third year, and I'm wondering if a GPA lowering in third year is a red flag for grad admissions.\n\nApologies if this variety of post is inappropriate for the subreddit, but the anticipation is eating me alive lol.",

I want to model the class on a class I took in college, which was mainly about reading two classic essays, at most around 40 pages long or so, and then writing 3 or 4 papers throughout the semester comparing them.\n\nI'm not quite sure what essays I should be using for this. I'm looking for like, Allegory of the Cave-style foundational classics. I read the Allegory only in this class and I don't think I'd have read it otherwise. So that's going in there. The rest of the stuff I remember is not super applicable to local context, so I'm looking for stuff that's less America-centric, and that deals with heavy topics about development, religion, maybe stuff like the status of women, but also fundamental philosophical concepts like how knowledge works, which information to trust, how to process and incorporate that information into existing belief systems, etc. Anti-superstition stuff is good, criticism of religion is good. I'm just throwing ideas out there. This isn't a checklist.\n\nBasically like, what are you guys glad you read in college, slash, what do you wish that you, or perhaps others, read in college more often?",

      "content": "I attended a graduate school that is generally considered to be in the top 30 schools in the USA, but certainly not in the top 10. During my PhD, conversations surrounding the job market in academic philosophy were universally bleak: I simply could not attend a party or event with other students from my school without someone bringing up what a dismal future we all had before us. “We picked the worst possible time to get into academic philosophy;” “Almost any other career path would offer better hopes for someone with our skills;” “If you’re not in Yale or NYU these days, it’s game over.” The horrors of the market may have been the single topic of conversation I discussed most with other philosophers while getting my PhD.\n\nOf the 10 students who started the PhD with me, one dropped out, and two are still doing theirs. The remaining seven of us have all found academic employment. One of us has a postdoc, which they chose over some more permanent offers because it’s high-profile and well-paying; the rest of us are in visiting or tenure track positions. Granted, we have had to move all over North America to get these positions, often in areas that we wouldn’t have chosen if we had lots of options. But nobody from my cohort has looked for work in academic philosophy and failed to find it. \n\nThis seems a far cry from job market conversations I’ve had as a postgrad, in which a decade of living year-to-year seemed destined for anyone lucky enough to find any employment at all; and in which tenure track positions were all but non-existent. \n\nWere my cohort just lucky, or is the negativity surrounding discussions about jobs in philosophy overstated?",

      "content": "I am in the arduous process of publishing my first research monograph.  Both Bloomsbury Academic and Routledge have offered me a contract for it, and I’m not sure which publisher to choose.  Any thoughts or advice on this issue?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRoutledge is of course significantly older and more established. But I feel like Bloomsbury is really on the rise, and they will of course not be young forever. Perhaps they might even soon take over Routledge's position on the market, or even match their reputation? What do you think reputation-wise, comparing the two?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBoth have worldwide distribution.  If anything, Bloomsbury's distribution is much much better when it comes to the two specific series that wish to include my book. The books within the relevant Bloomsbury series get into many many (!) more libraries than do the books in the relevant Routledge series, which is of course very important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBloomsbury’s production quality is much better, i.e., the books are made of better paper, covers, spine.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPRICING IS KEY\n\nPricing is almost my main concern. Bloomsbury's prices are more reasonable. ROUTLEDGE charges £39 for the paperback, £130 for the hardback, and £35 for the e-book. Would you pay £39? I probably would not pay that for someone's first monograph.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOn the other hand, BLOOMSBURY charges £30 for the paperback, £95 for the hardback, and £27 for the e-book. But they always seem to have a discount. I have never not seen them on sale. In reality and right now, the hard copies are 10 percent off, and the e-book is 20 percent off. Thus, in reality, they cost £27 (paperback), £85 (hardback), and £21 (e-book), which is unusually cheap for new academic books (cf. Brill and many other reputable publishers who only publish hardbacks and e-books at around £130).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut then again Routledge’s reputation is more established. And potentially getting a job from the book (based on the publisher's reputation) is the main concern.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDISCIPLINE\n\nMy book is within the history of political philosophy and geopolitics, and my main field of study is history.\n\nThe Routledge series is a geographical book series in which one of the two general series editors is well known within geography. On the other hand, the Bloomsbury book series is historical, and both of the general series editors are well-known emeritus professors. One is well known within history, the other in international law and intellectual history.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDo you have any thoughts on which publisher I should choose? It would be very helpful indeed if you could state your academic rank (f.ex. postdoctoral researcher, associate professor, full professor, etc.) in your reply. Any thoughts are much appreciated. Many thanks!",

      "title": "Note taking (for large research projects) how do you (academic philosophers) do it?",
      "content": "I am finishing up my MA thesis this summer before I begin my PhD in philosophy...it's going okay all things considered.  Unfortunately, I made the silly decision to read all my research (mainly books, not articles) in hard-copy, instead of my usual reading of PDFs. This was mainly because it's summer, so I wanted to read outside easier (I dislike reading on my iPad outside) and because I've read research that suggests that you retain more information/enjoy reading more when reading *real* books instead of digital copies (which in my experience I agree with).\n\nSo yes, I bought all the books, read them all, highlighted/annotated in them, and now...I have 12+ books that I have been brutally typing up every highlighted paragraph/sentence into a word document. Granted, I have a strong grasp of the content through this. But it is very tedious and slow going. Previously, I just used an app like Highlight, where I highlighted/annotated in the PDF which then transferred those notes (and page numbers) automatically to a separate document, which I could then print and start writing with...needless to say I am regretting this. I have not hand-typed (or even handwritten long books) for years, probably not since high school--where I had a lot less to read and a lot less to write. But I still am not looking forward to going back to digital research in the future, given that it feels less enjoyable and in-depth than actually reading the actual hard copy book.\n\nSo I'm just wondering, how do other graduate students/academic philosophers/professors handle note taking and research for large projects? Do you find digital books harder to grasp or enjoy, or does it not make a difference to you? My supervisor told me he photocopies all his books and then cuts up the paragraphs and glues them onto paper (granted, he is elderly and he does not know how to use a computer very well). This sounded pretty crazy to me, but now I am thinking I might try that for my next project because this clearly is not practical. Does anyone care to share their methods? Happy for any suggestions, no matter how radical or strange. Never again do I want to type of dozens of books containing massive highlighted sections...\n\nEdit: I was going to initially post this in a graduate student subreddit, but given that I am philosophy grad student and specifically seeking ideas relating to note taking for philosophical research (particularly large books), I realize there are numerous methods for other disciplines that involve other kinds of research such as quantitative ect. that is not necessarily relevant to my current situation. I apologize if this is a silly post for discussion, but I am genuinely curious and would like to hear some other opinions on this. ",

MacIntyre's virtue ethics seem socially conservative to me, and Sandel's arguments againt markets are also made on the grounds that they erode communities. What do you think?",

      "content": "Hi, I'm finishing up my master's in Philosophy from Europe soon. I have been interested in various disciplines throughout my bachelor's as well as master's (both in philosophy). I have also dabbled quite a bit in filmmaking and photography as a minor. \n\nI'm currently sending out emails to profs all across europe, US for possible positions as research assistanships - but haven't had much luck finding anything paid. Plus being a third country national just complicates the visa stuff more. So I'm not sure how to proceed further. \n\nI'm interested in gaining research experience in topics combining philosophy with cognitive science. For instance, studying how children understand social hierarchies would be super interesting to me. Or how false belief ascriptions and social epistemology interact and have implications cross-culturally. I'm also super interested in different aspects of joint attention and cooperation involved in communication. Ultimately I'd like to move towards more of such research, apply for PhDs next fall after having a more concrete idea of what I want to focus on, and work as UX researcher or policy designer/researcher for more inclusive design or better user experience in general. \n\nMy master's thesis focused primarily on how often in the name of inclusivity, it is the marginalised who end up with the epistemic burden of having to explain their experiences - often in the way the dominant framework would understand. I used examples from queer refugee asylum cases, testimonies regarding marital rape, etc. - how the victims usually either do not have the language or the dominant language does not serve their interests. So this combined some social epistemology with political philosophy and a bit of language/concepts. It could further have implications on how we build inclusive policies in general without putting further responsibility on the already marginalized groups. I really enjoyed working on this (although it didn't turn out to be as good as I expected). So, moving forward with something like this or combining this with research from cogsci would be something I'd be super into\n\nDo you have any advice on kinds of positions/places/fellowships/internships or just skills and courses or readings or people I could look into? Anything would be super helpful!!",

      "content": "Hey everyone,\n\nFirst, I’ll say I just hopped on Reddit, and wow, the fact that there are professional and hobbyist philosophers willing to give advice and guidance on a platform like this is really great. Even if some of it is hilarious to read, I’m thrilled to be a part of it.\n\nI’m a 27-year-old male currently finishing up my associate degree at a local community college in Texas. I spent the first seven years of my adulthood in the military and traveled around the country a bit before coming here. The years in between were filled with not-so-proud moments. For the sake of time and focus I’ll spare the details. Long story short, my journey has led me to develop a genuine love for philosophy; it was the wedge that finally allowed me to crack the shell I had built up through years of self-abuse. With that said (and after multiple long talks with my professor), I plan on becoming a professional philosopher and professor when the time comes. I have a pretty good shot at getting into a good school (looking like UT) but it’ll be nail-biting until then. As far as my goals go, I don’t have any intentions of becoming the next Kant or even working at a major university; I would be content teaching at the community college level if that’s how it shakes out. (I’ve lived like iv been in a recession my whole life, so $60–70K a year would be sweet.)\n\nI’d say my philosophical knowledge is mediocre at best right now. Because of the size of my community college, there aren’t many people to discuss philosophy with on a regular basis, neither staff nor students. I feel like I’m unsure how to approach studying in a way that will be most beneficial at my level, at least until I can be around others who are studying philosophy seriously. For now, I tend to read the classics (more often than anything post-Descartes), due to my infatuation with Aristotle’s writings on ethics (my favorite) and Socrates’ method of questioning—but I’d like to be more well-rounded when I arrive at university as well as further down the line. So my questions, while a bit broad, are what I mentioned above, and I’m also asking for any guidance on methods and techniques one can go about genuinely learning this awesome discipline. Feel free to include anything from anecdotes to straight-up links, I can’t wait to read ’em.\n\nThanks, everybody glad to be here.",

I’d love recommendations for books that challenge foundational assumptions: works from philosophy, psychology, comparative religion, evolutionary sociology, epistemology, cultural anthropology, etc.; anything that pokes at the edges of thought.\n\nTo give a sense of what I’ve found impactful in the past, here’s a list of titles I once considered seminal to my own development:\n\n* *The Trouble with Being Born* – Emil Cioran\n\n* *The Uncertainties of Knowledge* – Immanuel Wallerstein\n\n* *Essays and Aphorisms* – Arthur Schopenhauer\n\n* Most of Nietzsche\n\n* *The Life of the Mind* – Hannah Arendt\n\n* *A History of Western Philosophy* – Bertrand Russell\n\n* *The Modern Mind* – Peter Watson\n\n* *Existential Psychotherapy* – *Yalom*\n\n* *Mortal Questions* – Thomas Nagel\n\n* *Others in Mind* – Philippe Rochat\n\n* *The Silk Roads* – Peter Frankopan\n\n* *Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion* – David Hume\n\n* *Physics as Metaphor* – Roger S.

My Question is,is this different from the discussons in University? I can imagine it could be, because the students follow the same curriculum and therefore are more likely to understand each other because they leared the words in a similar context, or is there any discussion at all? Because the other thing i see is that public available stuff is mostly about learning already postulated stuff instead of a debate about a topic, where are the debates between professionals to be seen? Is it just through paper publications? And how do i reconstruct a complete discourse on a specific topic if its spread around the globe as single articles in various papers of different languages?\n\n\n\nThe things im interested in would be: Projecting schools of thoughts like marxism,poststructuralism and some other ideologies and eventually religions and states in a Directed Graphtheory Graph using poulation size changes over the years,statistics about word usage,publication dates of specific books and communication methods, to test some ideas i have about Radical Constructivism.\n\nBut since im no academic i have no idea where to start, ive read the stuff i deem relevant, like:Maturana,von Förster,von Glasersfeld,Luhmann,Zizek,Watzlawick,Foucault,Marx,Graph theory and a lot more,  but i know i still lack a lot and would really like to see an example of how this stuff would be discussed in the right setting, to learn how to identify the incompatibilties that can come up.",

      "content": "Hey there, I am a psychotherapist with a philosophy hobby. I have been working on integrating some concepts from the Greek eudaemonists into my own clinical thinking. I'm particularly interested in the ethical common ground between Plato and Epicurus (despite the many obvious differences in metaphysics, etc). \n\nI thought I would share some of the fruits of my labor here, though I'm not entirely sure if my post will be welcome or interesting enough and will be happy to remove it if you'd like. But, if anyone is interested, I'd love to discuss and am very open to feedback.\n\nBasically, I'm developing an analogy between pleasure and nutrition based on the shared theory of Plato and Epicurus of a 'restoration model of pleasure': a healthy food (or real food) is analogous to a true pleasure in Plato and a choiceworthy kinetic pleasure in Epicurus in that it actually contributes to overall happiness and health. Empty calories are analogous to false pleasures in Plato and unchoiceworthy kinetic pleasures in Epicurus in that they may cause pleasure in the moment but don't contribute to overall happiness and health. So, it could be helpful to think of pleasures simply as healthy or empty. And while we use the concept of nutritional value to measure the nutritional benefits of foods, we might think of therapeutic value as the measure of any given pleasure's potential to restore or support well-being.  \n  \n[Plato and Epicurus on How to Measure Your Pleasure](https://vacounseling.com/plato-epicurus-measuring-pleasure/)",

I wanted to see if my reasoning holds up.\n\nMy basic thought is that Plato’s Forms, if taken literally, are unfalsifiable and thus problematic (à la Karl Popper and the burden of proof fallacy). But as a metaphor, they seem useful—especially in the sense that scientific reasoning assumes there are fundamental truths that reason alone can uncover. However, one issue I see is that Plato seems to treat human categories (e.g., “cat”) as universally real in the same way as something like gravity, which seems questionable.\n\nI also wonder if Wittgenstein’s distinction between scientific and social truths fits into this discussion, but I’m not sure if that fully captures the problem.\n\nDoes this make sense? Where do you think my reasoning falls apart? Kindly destroy it to pieces, because I really want to fix it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "title": "human knowledge and its unstable ground: the problem of the conditioned starting point",
      "content": "One of the great \"problems\" of the human sciences and philosophy, and the reason they are perpetually debated and re-debated, lies in the difficulty of finding a \"fixed point\" (be it in a foundationalist or coherentist sense), a truth, a principle (or a set of principles), or an \"reasonably indubitable\", or reliable method capable of resisting and overcoming skepticism.\n\nWe are “thrown into the world” with \"innate\" cognitive structures and mechanisms of empirical-perceptive apprehension—a certain \"a priori\" way of interpreting reality, interfacing with things, processing, and organizing stimuli. The intuition of space, time, the self, and things; our biological, genetic, neural structure, and so on. Growing up—or better said, living—stimuli and experiences are heuristically organized and interpreted, not necessarily in a systematic and consciously logical way, but inevitably forming a framework of knowledge, judgments, memories, beliefs, concepts, modes of acting, thinking, and expressing ourselves.\n\nLiving in a society also has a significant impact. Education, dialogue, and interaction with others provide additional tools and notions—sometimes doubts, sometimes dogmas. Language, meanings, and concepts gradually increase in quantity and quality, becoming amplified and refined, offering interpretative keys to understand, qualify, and elaborate experiences.\n\nWe eventually reach a point where sufficient tools have been acquired to engage in (or consciously reject) this kind of discourse. To articulate everything mentioned above. To ask questions like, \"How did I come to know what I know?\" \"How can I be sure that what I believe I know corresponds to the truth?\" \"Is the reality I perceive and conceive the reality as it is, or as it appears to me?\" \"What does it mean to say that something is true?\"—and, if possible, try to find answers.\n\nWe ask ourselves on what fundamental principles my claim to knowledge of things is based, whether there is some fundamental *logos* that permeates and informs reality. In effect, we try to “go” (which sometimes also feels like a \"return\") to the heart of things, to the *a priori* categories, the first principles of logic and reason, the foundational mechanisms of knowledge… but we never do so in purity, in an objective, unconditioned way, with a “God-Eye View.”  \nWe will always do so from a perspective that is already constructed and constituted—a “Worm-Eye View”—founded on a pre-existing body of knowledge, of experiences, concepts, and principles, already organized in a more or less coherent web of beliefs… acquired and arranged without realizing that what was being formed was, precisely, a \"pre-existing body of knowledge.\" Without this body, it would undoubtedly not even be possible to \"pose the problem.\" But at the same time, it inevitably conditions our inquiry, forcing it to begin (which is not and cannot really be a true \"beginning\") from a certain constrained perspective.\n\nTo master the tools that allow me to (attempt to) understand and describe things and knowledge in their essence, in their (possible) truth and fundamentality, we must already have distanced ourselves significantly from the essence of things, from the foundation, from the “first principles” of knowledge, from their \"spontaneity in the flesh.\" Or rather, not distanced ourselves—since these elements may still always be present in our inquiry—but we are nonetheless compelled to adopt a perspective that is not primordial, not authentic, but already excessively elaborated, constructed, \"artificial.\" Conditioned, never neutral.\n\nWe can never (re)trace and (re)construct our epistemological and ontological process in purity, (re)proposing ourselves in an unconditioned point of view or finding a new one that is unconditioned, because to do so we would have to give up the tools that allow us to conceive notions such as truth, fundamental principle, reality, knowledge, and so forth.\n\nThe starting point will therefore always be highly complex, rich in notions and contradictions, disorganized experiences, memories—a web of beliefs in constant flux (even the very core of collective scientific and philosophical knowledge is itself not stable, never fixed, never immune to revision and reconsideration)... And starting from this condition—never neutral and never stable, which is anything but coherentist or foundationalist—we attempt, “so to speak, in reverse,” to (re)reduce everything to first principles and/or solid criteria of truth. But these will always be, even if we assume to have found them, contestable and uncertain, in virtue of the fact that the search began with postulates (ontological, semantic, linguistic, and epistemological) that were not themselves justified by or founded on that solid principle or criterion we believe we have found. But since these postulates were necessarily presupposed as the starting point of the process, they will hardly be subject to overly critical and selective skepticism in light of the very principle thus identified.\n\nTo be able to say what is fundamental and/or true (indeed: to conceive and understand the activity aimed at establishing what is fundamental and what is true), one must first have lived, experienced, accumulated notions and meanings and many other things that may themselves not be fundamental or even true.\n\nAnd so, at the moment I declare to have understood what is fundamental and what is true, I can never \"truly (re)start\" from this hypothetical fixed point, and from and on this \"new ontological and epistemological beginning\" I believe I have found or established, build a theory of knowledge and truth anew. This principle/foundation, which I imagine as the new key to interpreting the world and justifying things, will always be derived from an interpretative horizon that is unjustified, and therefore never authentically \"original.\"\n\n**TL; dr: Human knowledge is shaped by innate structures and lived experience, and the search for fundamental principles of truth is constrained by preexisting frameworks. Attempts to find a stable epistemological foundation are inherently conditioned and ultimately constrained by the tools and assumptions we necessarily adopt to conceive and begin such a search.**",

      "title": "Potential Circularity in Kant's Derivation of the Categories",
      "content": "While studying Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, I noticed what might be a **potential circular structure** in how **Kant derives the categories.**\n\n# The Potential Circular Reasoning:\n\nKant argues that:\n\n1. **Categories (pure concepts of the understanding)** are necessary to provide **unity to synthesis**.\n2. The **unity of synthesis** is necessary to form **concepts**.\n3. **Concepts** are necessary for the **functions of judgment**.\n4. The **functions of judgment** are used to **derive the categories**.\n\nThis leads to a potential **circle**: **Categories → Unity of Synthesis → Concepts → Functions of Judgment → Categories.**\n\n# Supporting Quotes from Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (B Edition):\n\n1. **Categories enable the unity of synthesis:** “The same function which gives unity to the various representations in a judgment also gives unity to the mere synthesis of representations in an intuition, which is expressed generally as the pure concept of the understanding.” (B104-105)\n2. **Unity of synthesis is necessary to form concepts:** “The spontaneity of our thought requires that this manifold first be gone through in a certain way, taken up, and combined, in order for knowledge to arise. This act I call synthesis.” (B102-103)\n3. **Concepts are necessary for the functions of judgment:** “Understanding is the faculty of thinking, and thinking is knowledge through concepts.” (B93-94)\n4. **Categories are derived from the functions of judgment:** “The functions of the understanding can be completely discovered if one can present the functions of unity in judgments exhaustively.” (B94) “In this way, there arise just as many pure concepts of the understanding as there were logical functions in all possible judgments.” (B105)\n\n# Questions for Discussion:\n\n1. **Does this structure necessarily imply circular reasoning?**\n2. **Is there a way to resolve this apparent circularity within Kant's system?**\n3. **Has this potential circular reasoning been discussed or addressed in Kantian scholarship?**\n\n# Additional Context:\n\nI've received some feedback suggesting that Kant's system represents a **structural interdependence** rather than a circular argument. The idea is that categories, synthesis, and judgments are **mutually dependent** and should be seen as part of a holistic system, not a linear causal chain.\n\nI’ve also received some feedback suggesting that this **circularity might not necessarily be a flaw.** One pointed out that circularity isn’t inherently problematic unless it forms a vicious circle, and that Kant’s system might instead represent a **virtuous circle** or a structural interdependence.\n\nAdditionally, referencing Henry Allison’s interpretation, it was suggested that Kant’s Transcendental Deduction can be seen as **successful in demonstrating the necessity of the categories**, even if it leaves open questions about fully establishing the validity of experience—issues Kant addresses further in the Schematism of the Imagination.\n\nHowever, I'm still unsure whether this fully addresses the problem or if there's an **underlying circularity** in how Kant justifies the categories.\n\nI'd appreciate any insights, critiques, or references to existing literature that discuss this issue. Thanks in advance for your thoughts!",

Modernism is a loaded concept that ranges over many disciplines, but focusing on epistemology, most will agree that Modernism trusts the centrality of Natural Science in the knowledge. For Modernists, Natural Science isn't just another discipline of inquiry, but it rather occupies the center stage of human's knowledge of the world. This was evident in the Early Modern and Modern philosophies that stretch from 16st to 19st centuries.\n\n  \nThus, by being continuous with Natural Sciences, can we accurately describe Analytic Philosophy as Modernist?

Do you have specific criteria for evaluating a source?\n2. How do you handle contradictions between different pieces of information?\n3. What do you think of the idea of structuring knowledge into a ‘mindmap of truth’?\n\nBy 'mindmap of truth,' I mean a comprehensive framework that organizes different knowledge areas (e.g., science, philosophy, history) into a visual map. Each node would represent a specific claim or idea, branching into supporting evidence, counterarguments, and its relationship with other claims.

      "title": "The Interplay of Free Will, Balance, and the Nature of the Universe",
      "content": "This paper explores a philosophical perspective that intertwines the concepts of free will, balance, and the nature of the universe. It proposes a new view on the relationship between individual agency and universal harmony, suggesting that the universe exists as a system of balance where every imbalance creates compensatory effects. In this framework, free will is questioned, and the idea of a predetermined reality based on balance is presented as an alternative. This paper investigates these concepts in relation to established philosophical theories, offering both a critique of traditional free will debates and a new interpretation of how our actions might fit into the broader cosmic order.\n\nThe nature of existence has long been a subject of philosophical inquiry. Among the most enduring questions is the concept of free will—the capacity for individuals to make choices independent of external factors or divine predestination. This question often ties into broader debates about determinism, the structure of reality, and the role of human agency in shaping the future.\n\nIn this paper, I will argue that the universe operates in a state of balance, where actions and reactions are governed by an underlying system of equilibrium. According to this view, free will does not operate in the traditional sense, as every action is part of a larger cosmic balance, and all actions, whether good or bad, are the result of compensatory forces that maintain the harmony of the universe. The relationship between balance and free will is explored, along with the implications of this view for our understanding of existence itself.\n\nAt the core of this theory is the notion that balance is an essential feature of the universe. The idea of balance can be traced to many philosophical traditions, such as the yin and yang of Chinese philosophy or the concept of equilibrium in physics. However, these traditional concepts of balance often imply that opposing forces exist in perfect harmony. In contrast, the theory proposed here suggests that balance is not about equal forces coexisting in perfect symmetry, but about the dynamic interplay of imbalances that correct one another.\n\nThe universe is not static but is constantly in flux, with moments of imbalance creating the conditions for their own correction. This cyclical process allows the universe to remain constant and moving forward, despite the presence of fluctuations. The imbalance, when introduced into one part of the system, is counterbalanced by forces elsewhere, ensuring the overall equilibrium of the system.\n\nThe question of free will has been a cornerstone of philosophical debate for centuries. Traditional perspectives often fall into two camps: determinism and libertarianism. Determinism posits that every action is the result of prior causes, leaving no room for individual agency. Libertarianism, on the other hand, suggests that humans have the capacity to act independently, unimpeded by external forces or predestination.\n\nThe theory presented here challenges both these views. Rather than seeing free will as a simple binary between determinism and libertarianism, it suggests that free will exists within the constraints of a larger, deterministic system that maintains cosmic balance. Free will, in this context, is not about the total independence of the individual, but rather about the ability to choose within a framework that ensures the ongoing balance of the universe.\n\nIn other words, while individuals may feel that their choices are made freely, these choices are part of a greater system that compensates for any imbalance introduced into the universe. If someone makes a positive choice, it may lead to positive consequences, but if they make a negative choice, the universe will counterbalance this with negative consequences elsewhere. This dynamic ensures that the overall system of balance is preserved.\n\nA crucial aspect of this theory is that imbalances do not disrupt the natural order but rather create the conditions for balance to be restored. When individuals or events introduce an imbalance—whether through good or bad actions—this imbalance sends ripples through the system, prompting compensatory reactions. These reactions may not be immediately apparent, but they will eventually surface, ensuring that the universe maintains its constant state of equilibrium.\n\nThis view allows for both good and bad events to coexist, as each is necessary for the maintenance of balance. For instance, a negative event—such as a natural disaster or personal misfortune—may seem harmful in the moment, but it is part of a larger process that restores balance to the universe. The same holds true for positive events, which may create an opportunity for further growth or change, but must eventually be balanced out by opposing forces.\n\nIn this framework, every action, no matter how small, contributes to the larger balance of the universe. This leads to the idea that the actions of individuals are not entirely free but are interwoven with the cosmic balance, which ultimately shapes the course of existence.\n\nWhile the idea of a perfectly balanced universe is appealing, it also raises questions about the nature of existence itself. If the universe were perfectly balanced, would it truly be able to progress? Could the universe ever reach a state of perfection where no further change is needed?\n\nThe theory suggests that perfect balance does not necessarily equate to static perfection. Instead, balance is a dynamic process of ongoing change, with imbalances constantly being introduced and corrected. The universe, in this sense, is never truly \"perfect\" but always moving toward a state of harmony that ensures its continued existence. The idea of a \"perfect universe\" would imply an end to this dynamic process, which would contradict the nature of existence itself.\n\nRather than a fixed state of perfection, the universe is seen as a continuous cycle of imbalance and correction, with free will serving as one of the mechanisms through which these changes occur. As such, the imperfections of reality—whether they be personal suffering, societal struggles, or cosmic disruptions—are integral to the ongoing process of maintaining balance.\n\nThe theory ultimately questions the existence of free will as it is traditionally understood. If the universe operates according to a system of balance, then individual free will may be an illusion, as every action is part of a larger, predetermined system of cosmic equilibrium. However, this does not mean that humans lack agency entirely. Rather, free will exists within the confines of this system, allowing individuals to make choices that influence their immediate surroundings while also contributing to the larger cosmic balance.\n\nIn this view, free will is not about absolute independence but about making choices that are part of a larger, interconnected system. The appearance of free will arises because individuals can experience the consequences of their choices, but those choices ultimately contribute to the ongoing process of balance and equilibrium.\n\nConclusion\nThe theory proposed in this paper offers a new perspective on the relationship between free will, balance, and the nature of the universe. By challenging traditional notions of free will and determinism, it presents a view in which individual agency exists within a system of cosmic balance, where every action, whether positive or negative, is counteracted by compensatory forces that maintain harmony. While the universe may not be \"perfect\" in the conventional sense, it is constantly evolving and adapting, with free will playing a role in maintaining its balance. This perspective opens up new avenues for understanding existence, offering a novel approach to age-old philosophical questions\n\nThis is my first time getting into philosophical topics like this and I would like feedback on my perspective\n\n",

      "content": "If anyone has looked into the evolutionary problem of evil, I would love to have some ppl look into my response and see if I overlooked something obvious. I feel like I have a unique response. But also nobody has seen it yet. \n\nSo here’s a quick summary of the general argument (no specific person’s version of it)\nAlso a quick video of the argument, in case you are interested but haven’t seen this argument before:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ldni83gknEo?si=f9byLR29E-Ic01ix\n\nProblem of Evolutionary Evil\nPremise 1: An omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God exists.\nPremise 2: Evolutionary processes involve extensive suffering, death, and pain as core mechanisms.\nPremise 3: An omnipotent and omniscient God would have the power and knowledge to create life without such extensive suffering and death.\nPremise 4: An omnibenevolent God would want to minimize unnecessary suffering and death.\nConclusion: Therefore, the existence of extensive suffering, death, and pain in evolutionary processes is unlikely to be compatible with the existence of an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God.\n\nMy Response:\nPremise 1: In this world, all creatures will die eventually, whether evolution exists or not. Even if God used a different method of creation, creatures would still die and suffer. So, suffering and death don’t exist only because of evolution.\nThat leaves two options for God:\n\t1.\tOption 1: Let death happen without it contributing anything positive to the world, but still have a process that creates and betters creatures, operating separately from death and suffering.\n\t2.\tOption 2: Use evolution, where death helps creatures adapt and improve, giving death and suffering some (or more) positive benefits in the world while also creating and bettering creatures.\nConclusion:\nSince death is unavoidable, it is reasonable for God to use a process like evolution that gives death a useful role in making creatures better, instead of a process that leaves death with no positive consequences (or at least fewer positive consequences than it would have with evolution).\n\nBecause in both scenarios growth would still occur, and so would death, getting rid of evolution would only remove death of some of its positive effects (if not all). This makes it unfair to assume that God wouldn’t use evolution as a method of creation, given that we will die regardless of the creation process used.\n\nTherefore, it is actually expected that a good God would use evolution.\n",

      "title": "Searching for Contemporary Resources on Pluralism, Absolutism, and Actionable Approaches to Ethics",
      "content": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a layman philosopher deeply engaged in a project tackling some challenging areas of ethical philosophy, and I feel like I might be venturing into a novel direction where resources are scarce or scattered. \n\nI’m exploring the tension between pluralism (the coexistence of diverse moral systems) and absolutism (singular, universal ethical frameworks), but I’m struggling to locate recent works or thinkers addressing this in ways that align with what I’m trying to accomplish.\n\nHere are the key areas I’m grappling with:\n\n1. Managing Ethical Frameworks in Pluralism\n\nI’m looking for approaches that deal with the interactions and tensions between competing moral systems, particularly when their principles seem irreconcilable.\n\nThe focus isn’t on resolving these conflicts entirely but on creating tools or methodologies to navigate them productively. For example, I’m curious about how dialogue, compromise, or iterative processes could foster coexistence without forcing convergence.\n\n\n2. Bridging Pluralism and Absolutism\n\nAre there works that engage with pluralism but also acknowledge the need for guiding principles or provisional values to avoid the pitfalls of relativism?\n\nI’m interested in whether anyone has worked on systems that balance contextual adaptability with some degree of ethical clarity or structure.\n\n\n3. The Practical Application of Meta-Ethical Ideas\n\nI’ve been exploring meta-ethics but feel like many frameworks stop at theoretical analysis. I’m searching for works that go a step further by proposing practical methodologies for applying these theories in real-world contexts (e.g., governance, policy, or institutional ethics).\n\n\n4. Conflict and Coexistence Between Ethical Traditions\n\nMy project touches on the need for ethical tools that can operate across cultural and philosophical boundaries, particularly between Western and non-Western traditions (e.g., Indigenous knowledge systems, Eastern philosophies, Abrahamic ethics).\n\nI’m curious about whether anyone has worked on systems that facilitate coexistence without erasing the distinctiveness of these traditions.\n\n\n5. Balancing Adaptability and Accountability\n\nWhile some systems lean heavily into flexibility (risking relativism), others are too rigid to accommodate complex moral dilemmas. I’m searching for any work that proposes a middle ground—a disciplined way of handling ambiguity or conflict without abandoning accountability.\n\n\nWhat I’ve Explored So Far\n\nPhilosophers like Isaiah Berlin (value pluralism) and John Dewey (pragmatism) have been useful, but they often feel more foundational than contemporary.\n\nI’ve dabbled in ideas from Jürgen Habermas (discourse ethics) and Bernard Williams (contextuality of thick ethical concepts), but I’m struggling to find thinkers or works that extend these ideas in ways that match my focus.\n\n\nWhat I’m Hoping For\n\nContemporary Thinkers: Are there modern philosophers, theorists, or even students working on pluralism, absolutism, or navigating moral tensions in innovative ways?\n\nPractical Applications: Have there been recent attempts to create tools or systems for managing ethical pluralism at institutional, societal, or individual levels?\n\nInterdisciplinary Insights: Are there fields beyond philosophy I may be ignorant to(e.g., anthropology, sociology, or systems theory) that could inform these questions?\n\n\nI sometimes feel like I’m in uncharted territory because of the specific direction I’ve taken, but I’m hoping there’s work out there that can provide inspiration or insight. \n\nIf you know of books, articles, philosophers, interdisciplinary thinkers, or even niche discussions that touch on any of this, I’d greatly appreciate your recommendations.\n\nThanks in advance for your help!",

      "content": "\nBeen reading Hanks’ Propositional Content (2015). Overall I find Hanks’ theory interesting and lucidly argued. However one part vexes me somewhat. In discussing the problem of empty names, Hanks argues that a semantically competent speaker should know that Zeus and Jupiter “co-refer” although they do not actually refer to anything. Thus acts of reference using these names fall under the same reference type, and the two names have the same semantic content. However in previously discussing problems involving co-referring names across different languages (eg, London and Londres), Hanks argues that it’s possible for a monolingual English speaker to be competent with the English language names Peking and Beijing, yet fail to know they co-refer, and under his theory the two names therefore have different semantic content because acts of reference involving them fall under different reference types. This seems arbitrary to me. Does anyone who has read this book have a better understanding of why Hanks’ would argue competent speakers could fail to know Peking and Beijing co-refer, but not in the case of Jupiter/Zeus? ",

From a doylist perspective this is the player selecting which of the presented ideologies, belief systems, and leadership styles they would prefer to live under and/or have the rest of a hypothetical world live under. Which would hopefully get a engaged player thinking about their own belief systems and what they prioritize.\n\nThe reason why I'm posting this is that I only knows so much about the ideologies I want to explore and despite the research that I have done my understanding of them remains shallower than I would like, thus I would very much appreciate having a conversation with someone who has a better understanding of the kinds of things I am trying to explore so that things I am missing, or questions that I should be asking but haven't thought of might be brought to my attention so I can continue working on this project with a more complete understanding.\n",

It seems similar to Hume’s ‘is/ought’ distinction… what I mean by this is that it feels fallacious to jump from the realm of the conceivability to possibly, like jumping from understanding some concept in mathematical language to then trying to understand that something in Latin… essentially it seems like there is inequivalence in the concepts/realms of conceivability and possibility\n\nIn short, I'm curious to know if it is correct to think it is fallacious to move from conceivable to possibility… or if there is a step between the two that makes it acceptable.",

      "content": "I am trying to do some research on the history of nominalism and how it influenced the scientific method. There is this argument going around that nominalism has had a greater influence on science than naturalism. This is because the notion of what is natural have changed to suit science rather than science changing to suit our conception of what we think is natural. \n\nFor example, Aristotle thought that teleological, final causes were natural to the essence of a thing. We would consider this notion of essences to be more or less supernatural leaning. Or at least you certainly don't have to believe in teleology to be a naturalist. \n\nThe idea is that nominalist ideas have had more of an influence on science than naturalism because naturalism is defined by science to an extent rather than naturalism defining what is scientific. An example of nominalism influencing science would be the removal of a concern for final cause from the scientific method made by Francis bacon. The reason this may be credited to a nominalist approach is because of the rejection of forms or universals which is very closely related to Aristotle's notion of purpose coming from a things essence. As such this is more of a nominalist thing than a naturalist thing because whether you consider teleology to be natural or not is basically a vibes based thing or so the argument goes. \n\nAre there any interesting resources or facts from history to consider when evaluating this argument?

This short article traces the critical rupture between ancient and modern ideas of “the public” to the Roman authors, such as Cicero, through whose hands the legacy of Greek political thought passed before resurfacing in modernity. \n\nhttps://medium.com/@evansd66/i-am-not-a-public-man-4dd8b4d07467",

      "content": "When one starts reading Walter Benjamin for the first time the connection of the thinker to such seemingly opposite spheres seems too esoteric, or maybe even obscure. At least my encounter hasn't been far from this. Yet there is some kind of aura around his ideas that holds tightly around the mind at the same time. \n\nLanguage, for instance, and its wierd connection with the word and how it communicates through a materialist world but with God there too, apears like a sliperry matter. And this is backed up by the fact that Language is mediating something of itself which also corresponds to the word and it's relation to God. The narration of Language in this sense, from the religious stories alludes to the paradoxically route that Benjamin guides it to. \n\nHowever, with most of the stories of the tower of Babel and the fall being quite recognisable, a comprehensive understanding of his stance of Language slides out of my mind whenever I want to give a holistic account of it. \n\nSo my questions would be: \n1. How do you view Benjamin's thought? Specially his views on language and history.\n2. Did you have the same first experience with him? (Not difficult to grasp, but difficult to retain a comprehensive picture of his thought because of it being too particular.)\n3. Is the combination of theist thought with dialectical materialism something that could be taken seriously, bearing  in mind the theoretical and historical opposition of the two?\n\nThank in advance for your contribution.\n\nP.s: If anyone has used his work on language on for analysis of a short story, novel or a poem I'd like to hear about your appliance of the theory to a piece of literature. And if anyone knows any short secondary literature as good as the one by Agamben, please feel free to suggest them.",

      "title": "Is Power Evil? J.Krishnamurti vs Nietzsche",
      "content": "I am stuck between the opposing views of two prominent philosophers of all time, Jiddu Krishnamurti and Nietzsche. The issue is about the Axiology of power.\n\nPower is not necessarily always a zero sum game. When one gains power, gains responsibility. By seeking power, one nation can protest against any invasion, not only for self-defence, but to save neighbouring countries too.\n\nFor Nietzsche, power is at the top of all values.\n\"What is good? - All that heightens the feeling of power, the will to power, power itself in man.\nWhat is bad? - All that proceeds from weakness.\nWhat is happiness? - The feeling that power increases — that a resistance is overcome.\"\n\nYou are actually seeking more power, when you try to improve your painting skills or hit more sixes. Weakness leads to corruption, while power makes you overcome your vices and make better choices. No progress in accumulation of power makes life dull and stagnant. The last man (the very weak man) becomes an object, a slave to vices and a victim of life.\n\nOn the other hand, for Krishnamurti, power is inherently evil. Power opposes love. The greatest love is justice and the greatest justice is freedom, the highest value in life. Power, in any form, restricts the freedom of others. Even churches are evil in this way.\n\nThere is also a confusion here regarding what they mean by power, and what their intent is. What do you think of this debate and what are your own views regarding power?",

      "content": "Hi! I am a Chinese high school graduate who wants to study philosophy at a college level. My ultimate aim, ideally, is to enter a top American PhD program (Yale, Princeton, UMich, NYU, Pitts, Harvard etc.) and stay in the academia. Now I have two offers: Cambridge Philosophy (at a college that is not so prestigious as St John’s or Trinity) and New York University Abu Dhabi, a quite American liberal arts-styled college. The question is, which one should I choose? \n\nI assume that NYUAD is closer to the American system and there’s a better chance of entering a PhD program right after graduation; and NYUAD students can stay in NYC for a semester and network with the top philosophers in New York. Also, one thing I like about NYUAD is that I can double major (E.g. philosophy and maths) which increases not only my potential research opportunities but also my employability, if I fail in the stiff competition of entering the academia. Moreover, NYUAD’s courses are not as Eurocentric as Cambridge, and I do have a profound interest in Indian and Chinese philosophy other than the Anglophone philosophy. \n\nMeanwhile, Cambridge seems more prestigious with Oxbridge brand effect, and the Faculty at Cambridge includes many famous professors. The teaching of philosophy at Cambridge seems more solid and rigorous. It only takes three years, although I assume I need to spend another one or two years on Master’s before applying for PhD. One concern is that Cambridge doesn’t seem to perform really well in the Gourmet Report, and I doubt whether a Cambridge BA in philosophy is so worth it. \n\nMy personal background is that I do not have abundant funds available, so it’s difficult to afford more than one year of grad program if it’s unfunded (so let’s say if two years of Oxford BPhil, or some prestigious law school, is unfunded, I may not attend). For undergraduate costs, three years at Cambridge costs roughly the same as four years at NYUAD (NYUAD gives me partial aid), and these costs are affordable. \n\nI have heard of many available pathways, but I would really love to hear your advice on which offer I should accept so that I can get into a top American Philosophy PhD program in the fastest (and ideally, cheapest) way. Especially, how likely is it to go straight into a top PhD program after I graduate from NYUAD? And what about Cambridge MPhil? Are there other good pathways if I start from either of these two (for example, what about Toronto’s funded one-year MA program?)\n\nThank you so much for your help!",

I'm not looking to argue about whether it's true or not here, just sources from people who've advocated for similar ideas for my paper.\n\nI'm not looking to argue about indeterminism or determinism, or whether psychological constraints should count or not. I'm just looking for perspectives that support this idea under the assumption that we're working with a theory of free will that requires a lack of psychological constraints. I'm also not looking for scientific evidence, like the thing about how your brain makes a decision before you realize it thing,\n\nAll I've been able to find are studies about whether people diagnosed with mental disorders believe in free will or not, or just vague restatements that mentally ill people are psychologically constrained. Maybe I should look into the neurodiversity or the antipsychiatry movements? If anyone has any specific readings, I'd appreciate.",

I recently finished an MA + plan to apply to Ph.D programs this coming fall.  I'm pretty conversant with philosophical aesthetics and contemporary critical/literary theory + between the scattered phil. adjacent English Lit. courses I took in school/reading more contemporary stuff, I feel like I'm *reasonably* comfortable dealing with more strictly philosophical concepts when a critic starts to bring them to bear on a text (provided I'm in capable hands and they do an alright job introducing ideas).   \n\nThat said!  I've been more and more drawn to theoretical work lately (Paul Ricoeur, Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, early/solo Deleuze, Michel Serres) that I think might demand a little bit more familiarity with the actual source texts instead of being able to skate by on author summaries and a passing familiarity with concepts.  My usual approach has been to either cruise the stanford encyclopedia or pull the text off of project gutenberg and read the relevant passage/excerpt, but this still feels a little bit too ad hoc and patched together.  \n\nOne of the things I've been making it a point to do during my gap year before putting in the next round of grad school apps has been filling holes in my reading -- this feels like a big one.  Obviously, I'm interested in picking this up and reading it toward a specific end + I'm already busy w/ work that's actually in my field -- I'm not looking to pick up a full on classical education.  However...I'd also like to feel less like a dilletantish interloper and I'd like to pick up enough background that I feel a bit less like I'm holding on for dear life when I'm reading Ricoeur or Deleuze.    \n\n\nWanted to ask about a good/thorough, maybe one-step-deeper-than-a-general-survey anthology that covers ancient stuff other than the Socratics (not trying to avoid them -- i've just got a much better handle on what I need to read compared to other corners)",

This section is the one that is philosophical in a more classical sense: I want to examine what ontological commitments follow in using CT as a language for metaphysical reasoning. My hunch currently is that CT has an interesting advantage: it is a language that - roughly speaking - talks about other languages.  It therebey grants languages (as well as the worldviews that migght be formulated in them) an explicit place in its ontology. This hunch might be expressed in the slogan: \n\n(S) Worldviews are inextricably part of the world they are views of\n\nEven though this might be a truism for some people it could be very interesting to find the spirit of (S) in a rigorous mathmatical framework (like ologs or CT) \n\nThe paper presupposes knowledge in basic set theory.\n\nBest regards & thank you!",

      "content": "I did an bach in philosophy (which I am proud to have done by the way) and then a PhD in biology. I learned many things of great value in both courses. There's a particular bit of biology, from the '80s-'90s, which has many philosophical implications. It's called [costly signalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle), and among other things it explains much of why aesthetic preferences exist. It is established science now and is taught in all evolutionary biology courses and most psychology courses.\n\n**Knowing why aesthetic preferences exist, of course, does not \"solve\" aesthetics or anything like that**; there are still big philosophical questions in aesthetics. But, I look back on my own aesthetics course as being a bit silly in not mentioning, at least in one powerpoint slide or something, the main reason we have aesthetic preferences. A bit of googling suggests there aren't aesthetics courses teaching costly signalling, even though it's been another decade+, and we have [pop science](https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/117/1/269/5561629) books [explaining](https://www.elephantinthebrain.com/) it [now](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691154398/why-everyone-else-is-a-hypocrite).\n\nIs it because philosophers are more likely to be sceptical that costly signalling theory is to be believed? Or because they accept it in principle but consider it irrelevant to the philosophy of beauty?

      "content": "Hello all, in this post I'm asking for lots of general advice on philosophy professors/mentors and on my philosophy \"journey\". I'll start by outlining my situation and then I'll get into some questions.\n\nI frequently dwell (with lots of anxiety) on topics of Epistemology (skepticism, infinite regress problems, logic, confirmation-bias worries, etc.), Existentialism (anxiety, fulfillment, meaning, suicide, life, death, making decisions, etc.), and Cognitive Science. I'm generally motivated by extreme anxiety and extreme confusion (this is both good and bad tbh).\n\nI want to continue my journey, but I frequently make mistakes and oversights in my thought, writings, and readings of texts. So I like to get people's help.\n\nBecause I live in a random Middle Eastern country, I can only turn to reddit or discord to ask questions. But when I ask people online, i feel like they have just as much oversight and tunnel-vision as me. So I thought about finding someone who is an expert on these topics to talk with.\n\nMy plan is to go study at a university in Europe or North America. There, I will be able to talk to professors or therapists who are experts in these topics. Assuming that I can get accepted into such universities, my questions are the following:\n\n1. Would therapists really help? They might be experts on the anxiety side of things, but I'm worried that (because they aren't experts in philosophy) they wont use rigor in their arguments, and I'll feel like they're just saying stuff to make me feel good or whatever.\n2. I plan to ask professors during their office hours, would this be accepted by them? Would it be a positive relationship, or would they be busy and disinterested?\n3. How do I go about searching for professors who are experts on these topics? Most universities only list general specializations such as Philosophy of Religion, Ethics, Logic, or Philosophy of Mind. I'm pretty confused on what to look for, which professors will most help me with my above interests?\n\nBut I want to make it clear that I'm not 100% sure about this plan. For instance, I sometimes feel like my focus might be better directed at psychiatric analysis instead of philosophy. I also sometimes feel like this plan is absurd (going to another country to get mentorship. isn't the internet be enough?!).\n\nSo I'm posting this to get general advice. Aside from answering the main questions, please also correct me on anything I got wrong or could do better. Thanks",

      "title": "Applying Promissory Force and Promissory Value to the concept of Western Democracy",
      "content": "  \n\n1.Promissory force is the expectation that an initial action on an initial satisfaction set is likely to produce an increased consequent satisfaction set.\n\nA satisfaction set = \n\n1. Satisfaction = Positive Satisfaction : Having what you want, and Control satisfaction : excluding what you don’t want.\n\n2. Non-Satisfaction = Frustration : not having what you want and Dissatisfaction : Having what you don’t want.\n\nA strong promissory force = a strong expectation such that it is believed that the action is likely and the mapping from initial to consequent is likely.\n\nA weak promissory force = a weak expectation such that it is believed that the action may not be likely or the mapping from initial to consequent may not be likely.\n\n2.Promissory Value is the expected subjective experience of Promissory Force acting on the feelings of, positive satisfaction, control satisfaction, frustration and dissatisfaction over each of the personal, cognitive, emotional and social domains.\n\nPromissory Value is weak when the expected experience is frustrated or dissatisfied, but strong when the expected experience has positive or control satisfaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBards Response:The concepts of Promissory Force and Promissory Value are interesting frameworks for analyzing the dynamics of Western democracy. Here's how they might apply:\n\n**Promissory Force:**\n\n* **Strong Force:**\n* **Positive expectations:** Strong institutions, free and fair elections, a robust legal system, and a vibrant civil society can create a strong promissory force. People believe that their actions (voting, participating in civic life) will influence government decisions and improve their lives.\n* **Likely action and mapping:** Transparent and accountable governance, effective policies addressing citizen needs, and genuine responsiveness to public feedback can strengthen the belief that actions will lead to desired outcomes.\n* **Weak Force:**\n* **Negative expectations:** Corruption, voter suppression, political polarization, and unresponsiveness to citizen concerns can weaken the promissory force. People lose faith in the system and believe their actions will have little impact.\n* **Unlikely action or mapping:** Broken promises, ineffective policies, and a sense that the system is rigged for the benefit of the elite can further erode trust and weaken the belief that actions will lead to positive outcomes.\n\n**Promissory Value:**\n\n* **Strong Value:**\n* **Positive and control satisfaction:** When democratic processes lead to positive outcomes, such as improved living standards, greater equality, and individual freedoms, it generates satisfaction and reinforces the belief in the system's value. People feel empowered and in control of their own destiny.\n* **Personal, cognitive, emotional, and social domains:** A strong democracy can enhance individual well-being across various domains. It can foster personal growth, intellectual engagement, emotional security, and strong social bonds, all contributing to a sense of fulfillment and a positive promissory value.\n* **Weak Value:**\n* **Frustration and dissatisfaction:** When democratic processes fail to deliver on their promises, leading to economic hardship, inequality, or social unrest, it generates frustration and dissatisfaction. People feel powerless and disillusioned with the system.\n* **Negative impact on personal, cognitive, emotional, and social domains:** A weak democracy can have negative consequences across various domains. It can lead to feelings of hopelessness, cognitive dissonance, political apathy, and social divisions, all contributing to a diminished sense of well-being and a weak promissory value.\n\n**Application to Western Democracy:**\n\nWestern democracies face various challenges that can weaken the promissory force and value of their systems. These include:\n\n* **Rising inequality and economic insecurity.**\n* **Political polarization and declining trust in institutions.**\n* **The rise of populism and disinformation.**\n* **The erosion of civil liberties and democratic freedoms.**\n\nTo strengthen the promissory force and value of Western democracy, it's crucial to address these challenges. This may involve:\n\n* **Investing in social safety nets and promoting economic equality.**\n* **Reforming political systems to foster greater transparency and accountability.**\n* **Combating disinformation and promoting media literacy.**\n* **Protecting civil liberties and upholding democratic values.**\n\nBy strengthening the promissory force and value of their systems, Western democracies can ensure that they continue to meet the needs and aspirations of their citizens and remain resilient in the face of challenges.\n\n**Additional notes:**\n\n* This is a simplified framework, and the actual dynamics of promissory force and value in Western democracy are complex and multifaceted.\n* There are different perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of Western democracy, and the analysis presented here is based on a particular viewpoint.\n* Further research and analysis are needed to fully understand the role of promissory force and value in democratic systems.",

So as the subject understands that there is no ultimate satisfaction to this insatiable machine it produces new desires for itself to chase. This is all good and practical in itself, however wouldn't creativity become a desire itself that looses its fluctuations and then becomes an spectacle? The thing that I'm asking is related to the idea of a representation so when those ideas become  the repressing representation even if the thing itself is essentially kinetic and not static, couldn't that idea become a pedestal that one strives to and never reaches and because of its distance it becomes static? Couldn't the radical ideologies which try to deterritorialize everything to its limit till it reaches the edge become some kind of a territorialization in the self that it can't escape in the molecular level so that when it reaches the cosmological boundaries, the ouroboros has ate its tail already; so that the desiring machines which was directed to a state of potentially and creativity (something like body without organs), is nothing but a strive to be alive an strive to become a self in the eye of the other in Lacanian terms which will never lead to any radical change, and then change become the ultimate static point of creativity that we can not flee. The constant strive to speak  the word of the new becomes the oldest cliché without anything significant about it.",

      "content": "*so sorry ahead of time this is a long post :(*\n\nI just started at a community college for fun and to improve myself, not for a degree. I'm frustrated that I thought I'd be really into philosophy, thinking it dealt with more abstract and less mathematical ideas. It's been so logical and mathematical so far, and I can't bring myself to care about it anymore. I wish I did.\n\nI'm going through Cottingham's Western Philosophy anthology. Read a couple pieces each from Plato, Aristotle, Kant, Descartes, and Locke--first few units have been knowledge, metaphysics, and language.\n\nI suppose I thought philosophy would be more romantic. Maybe that's stupid. Or maybe I'm reading the wrong stuff--but I know many would argue these old guys are necessary reads. But it all just seems so inconsequential. \n\nI flunked the midterm on purpose because I hate the class and I resent myself for not living up to my own expectation, that is for not liking philosophy after years of seeing myself as a philosophical person. I'm not sure if I can even recover my grade, but if it is possible, there's no way I can pass with my current level of interest in the stuff. It's not even a cool indifference; I must admit I've come to despise every philosopher (except William James and J. L. Austen--they seem cool) for putting me through such nonsense. I keep thinking, they're rambling about substances and names while their souls rot inside them. I'm not a fan, but shouldn't I be?\n\nAnyway, should I just resign myself to the whole thing? Accept that it's not for me, and that as someone who rejects logic without heart, there's really no place for me? Am I allowed to search for interest in other sects of philosophy while hating Socrates and those dudes? Why does any of it matter at the end of the day? What keeps you guys interested?\n\nSorry for all this. Kind of at my wit's end. Love you all.\n\n.",

I'm yet to do significant reading on existencialism.\n\nI want to be able to produce accurate and quality writing in architecture using a philosophical approach, I don't know if that requires a formal education, but I bet it would make it easier.

      "title": "Philosophical essay pertaining to advertising - exploring the ideas of Baudrilliard, Deleuze and Nick Land",
      "content": "In the beginning, there was the product, but the product was formless and without significance; then there came the Ad. Just as the Ad breathed life into the product, it was given an identity, a voice and a purpose. The ad created a bridge between the creator and the consumer.\n\nAdvertising first tried to define its customers, then later the Advertisers became the taste makers, and currently we have gone full circle. First, culture influenced ads and then advertising inhabited its own hyperreality; trying to shape and dictate patterns of their own making through iterations, wherein the consumers tastes become subsumed by the market. They were entranced by, as Baudrilliard would put it, a system of objects. A system where one thing is not complete without the other. This would influence consumers to buy into a lifestyle that could define their era. Not just a lifestyle, but a normative conformity. The people who chose not to adopt this lifestyle were only signified as outcasts. These outcasts would form the counterculture, and from having no signifier they became signified as the “hippies”. Advertising influenced the counter culture, but ironically the counter culture would influence advertising. These advertisements tried to parallel the counterculture, such as the Hilltop coca-cola ad, which invokes a pro-peace statement.\n\nAs there became more saturation, Advertisers had to define their customer. Hitherto, in this information age, Advertising is now again about catering to the consumers needs by having enough information to define them.\n\nIf we take the words of baudrilliard from the Transparency of evil \"Each category is generalized to the greatest possible extent, so that it eventually loses all specificity and is reabsorbed by all the other categories. When everything is political, nothing is political anymore, the word itself is meaningless. When everything is sexual, nothing is sexual any more, and sex loses its determinants. When everything is aesthetic, nothing is beautiful or ugly any more, and art itself disappears.” We can see that advertising inhabits a realm that philosopher Gilles Deleuze refers to as a rhizome that is recursive and interdependent, thereby diluting meaning so that everything is seen as a mere image of something else. In this time of endless proliferation, the essential nature of advertising has transformed. The once clear boundaries that defined products, desires, and cultures have become porous. This has influenced society by creating a postmodern future where everything references everything else and nothing at the same time. Wherein advertising once inhabited the grand narrative, it is now skeptical of it and instead they target the meta-narrative. Wherein there would be multiple Ads showcasing the same product to target different meta-narratives, understanding that no one Advert can fit all.\n\nBaudrilliard explores the notion of stages of value; use value, the tangible and functionality of a product - its usefulness. Exchange value is the value of a product in relation to other products in a system of commerce, its determinant is what the item can be exchanged for. Sign-value is the symbolism generated by the product in a system of symbologies, it is more about the differentiation and status that this gives the consumer. The final stage, the one advertising is approaching, is the fractal stage wherein value is not dependent on the other stages of value. It is a value that is generated without reference to other original values. It is a system wherein all objects mirror themselves and references each other, whereby they dissolve all meaning by being connected to everything and nothing at the same time. It mirrors our postmodern age, wherein value is not viewed as a hierarchal structure, but rather nodes that sit in the interstitial of other nodes.\n\nAt this interstice, how do advertisers persuade consumers and influence culture? One realm it could occupy is those of memories, even as memories have been coopted for the future. By utilising nostalgia, wherein original meanings are still intact, consumers can see some authenticity in the product. In this age of constantly evolving ideals and ideas, nostalgia anchors the product in a time and place; a memory and a feeling the consumer once had. This had led the media market to adopt, in a world where everything is in a fragmentary state, wherein consumers no more crave the reality of their situations, a focus on a regressive type of market. This market has expanded into many categories, but the main one is the idea of children's entertainment for adults. Wherein real problems are layered with a hyperreality that soothes the consumer. Whilst the consumer desires for a non-hierarchal type of value, they also crave comfort in the familiar. However, as the fractal stage of value intensifies, the familiar becomes the other and the other becomes familiar in such a way that dilutes their original meaning. So that what is other vanishes and becomes familiar in such a way that everything reflects everything else, whereby there is no inherent meaning in these terms as they are interconnected.\n\nAnother lens wherein the impacts of advertising can be seen is in the idea, from the philosopher Nick Land, of hyperstitionality, wherein superstition becomes submerged with culture in a way that creates its own reality. It can be viewed as a fiction that becomes real. This can be seen in Debeers advertising for diamonds, such that now they are a foundational archetypal item for a wedding. In its referent to the use value of diamonds, as such that they are eternal, they created a sign-value of eternal love.\n\nSo how will advertising continue to persuade consumers in an age of endless proliferation, where the signifier and the signified blur and the relationship between systems of objects can be both arbitrary and recursive? How does hyperreality resurface itself into new iterations of objects? Wherein the advertisers again become the tastemakers. When will it be that the cyclical nature of advertising and culture recapitulate themselves?\n\nOne phenomena wherein advertisers can utilise persuasion tactics is as Rene Girard postulated, the idea of memetic desire. It is the idea that people desire things not because they want them, rather they are mimicking the desires of others. This can arise from competition or a desire to be accepted. The theory states that others desire the system of symbologies one person might have and see a certain product they have as a piece of the system.\n\nThe Aida model states that there are certain motivators that encourage the acquisition of objects, it hinges on the attention, interest, desire and the resulting call to action that result from it. But as attention has been overloaded, interest is apathetic and desire is still there, waiting for something to desire, how do advertisers create a call to action for consumers in an ever complex landscape? Semantic network theory states that the networking of seemingly disparate concepts interlock to create an assumption about a product. But if this networking becomes more and more arbitrary, how do advertisers grasp the essence of something when the essence of a thing is being dismantled into a structure?\n\nThe reference without a referent, as such that the referent is so far detached that it is occluded by other signs. They are chains of referents, copies of which have no original source: or the source is impossible to find. In a world that prioritises as Saussure would put it synchronic meaning as opposed to diachronic meaning, there is a threat that the root of a symbol is lost to history.\n\nWhilst meaning is being lost how do advertisers learn to effectively communicate the timelessness of a thing? How do advertisers convey meaning in the event horizon: where meaning has blurred itself by endless recapitulations of objects in a system that is constantly being absorbed and reabsorbed into other frameworks?\n\nSoon in the event horizon, there will only be the product and the consumer, not the consumers. As in the advertising will be directed directly towards an individuals, and it will slowly become a taste maker again. No more will there be timeless advertisements that parallel Debords Jewellery advertising or Coca-Colas Hilltop “I’d like to buy the world a coke” ad. As what is timeless becomes timely and back to timeless again.\n\nLinguistics and technology, thereby advertising, become subsumed - creating a hyperstitional hyperreality.\n\nIt is almost like a Hegelian dialectic through which once was through reflecting taste and then becoming tastemaker, is now through Advertising, linguistics and technology where the cyclical nature of advertising that has been surmised is endlessly going through a cycle of thesis, antithesis and synthesis.",

      "title": "Most influential analytic philosophers working today",
      "content": "There's a certain narrative of analytic philosophy which goes like this. Things began with Carnap dominating the scene. Then there came Quine who was *the* force to be reckoned with until the 70s. Then the torch was passed on to Kripke and Lewis, whose productivity continued onto the 90s.\n\nI wouldn't say I buy this 100%. Making history out is hard. Still, just speaking on my impression of reputation and influence, I feel that this timeline checks out. So suppose that the story is roughly correct. Now that it's been some 20 years since Lewis' death and some 30 years since Kripke was *really* active, I wonder who, if any, in your opinion, are the philosophers working today that currently exert as great an influence on the analytic philosophy scene as the ones I've already mentioned.\n\nTo be considered, I think two requirements are 1) significant contribution in a wide range of topics in theoretical philosophy and 2) deep and thoughtful engagements with formal apparatuses. Feel free to disagree!\n\nThe only candidates I can think of are Williamson and Kit Fine, which is why I'm posting this question to yall!",

I have been looking for a book that is intellectually challenging (for me), but the issue is that any books I find are either too simple (i.e. introductions to philosophy) or are too complex.  \n\nIf it helps, I recently finished Byung-Chul Han’s The disappearance of rituals, and found that to be a good level of difficulty – not something I could breeze through, but something I could comprehend if I took my time.\n\nI’m open to any field within philosophy, but would prefer not to have anything too politically-focused.  Any recommendations would be much appreciated.  Thank you.",

      "content": "I apologize if this is not the right place to post this, but given that this is not a question relating to graduate school or admissions, but rather on academic career preparation, thought it might be worth posting here. \n\nMy main question is when is it a good idea to start working on your Teaching Dossier for philosophy? I am starting my PhD in the fall along with a second Master's degree in a related field so I realize I will be pretty busy for the next year or so, and therefore am trying to get a jump start on preparing career related stuff. Ideally, I would like to get some form of adjunct/part-time teaching experience (e.g. in a community college) in the summer after my first year of my PhD or my second year...this is largely because my institution does not offer very many opportunities for teaching experience (ie. teaching a course yourself or even tutorial leading rather than just TA-ships) which I know is problematic, given that going on the job market, as I have been told, it's very important to have teaching experience, and many big universities in competing countries offer full courses to teach by the first or second year of your phd, so I realize I will have to go out-of-institution to get further teaching experience. I especially want to be prepared in the case that there is a teaching fellowship opening within the department, as I know there are 30+ other phd students who I will be competing against for it, as we are all desperate for teaching experience. \n\nI recently attended a workshop on creating a teaching dossier, so I understand the basics - but it was mostly geared towards post-docs and people in the health sciences, not humanities, and not graduate students just beginning out, so I'm a bit unsure what I can really include in this first (very rough) draft. I will be taking the teaching post-secondary course offered at my institution in my second year (cannot fit it into my schedule in first year) but I also regret that there isn't one specifically on teaching in philosophy the discipline, which I've been told is also a downside, as many universities offer specific teaching courses *for* philosophy.\n\n I feel a bit precocious and insecure, as I don't want to look silly when I start applying to random openings next summer/the following year (for positions requiring an MA) so I just wondered if anyone here has any advice or tips on what I should be including as a graduate student with no actual teaching experience beyond TA-ships, guest lectures, marking assistantships (do I include those?), and undergraduate TA-ships (do I include those?) E.g. do I include conference presentations? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

I’m very unsure and feel like I’m not doing enough to be set up for a good grad application.",

While I was at UCLA, I was co-president of the continental philosophy club and had a leadership position in the analytic philosophy club. I did a study-abroad in Cambridge University through UCLA in philosophy. By the time I was finishing my BA, most of my classes were graduate level courses in philosophy. I just can’t see my life continuing without pursuing it further. I now have a life after receiving my law degree to support my wonderful, supportive and caring wife and a beautiful baby girl, but the call to philosophy is so strong. I don’t know what to do!",

Probably 20 hours of class and the same for reading. \n\nWith that being said, I have no idea what to expect. I did a physics major as an undergrad not even because I loved it, but just because I happen to be gifted at it that seemed like a good use of my tuition money. I took a couple classes my senior year and really enjoyed them. \n\nDoes anyone have experience going into philosophy after studying something different for undergrad? Is it reasonable to think I could study this and work 20-25 hours a week as a consultant or free lancer?\n\nI want to do something that challenges me and stimulates my mind alongside a business venture or job that will allow me to invest and have some freedom when I get older. I have no aspirations for going into the field of academia, but this is something I feel I can grow from and find personal satisfaction in.\n\nIs it reasonable to study a P.H.D for personal satisfaction? Is it reasonable to think I can do things outside of this at the same time? Does how highly ranked the grad school affect how difficult the work is for a P.H.D (ie if I apply to a school ranked lower, will it be better for my school, work balance?)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome extra information in order to give better advice on weather this is possible(not sure if this is relevant but, nonetheless):\n\nI have always done well in school but never at been at the top of my class, mostly because I get bored pretty easily and have trouble sticking to learning one thing at a time:\n\n I am graduating with a gpa around 3.8 in math and physics in three years at a school ranked between 50 and 100 in the US. I scored a Gre of 331, 167 quant, 164 verbal, 5.5/6 analytical writing which I think could qualify me for a good P.H.D program.",

MBA is also an option for me, but I don’t want to go for corporate job with my initial experience of being totally disgusted by it. \n\nComing to the switch, has anyone done it before? Should I go for masters directly, or should I go for Bachelors degree first? I am pretty confident I can make up for the Bachelor’s courses, but still feel unsure and need advice from the people who are in the field. And what would you recommend as a good starting point?

Beauty, friendships, joy, freedom, dignity and so on. I believe that to act rightly is to maximize the good, where the amount of the good is some complex function of those things that are good.\n\nMost consequentialists believe something like the following:\n\nUnrestricted potential obligation (UPO): *For every action, there are possible circumstances in which you would be compelled to do it.*\n\nIt’s a terrifying result. There may be a few (trivial) exceptions from the consequentialist’s point of view. For example, you should presumably never deliberately increase the amount of net evil in the world. In the main though, UPO holds on most forms of consequentialism. There’s nothing the right (wrong) circumstances could not compel you to do if you are a committed consequentialist. In the right circumstances- if the world would blow up if I didn’t do it- I would be obliged, for example, to kill my dearest friends, lovers, and parents. We can think of even more disturbing possible actions- I’ve even had people put them to me in arguments. This is not something I take lightly. I regard the UPO as a grave and tragic truth.\n\nThere’s an industry dedicated to sneering at consequentialists about their moral ruthlessness- arguing it implies a kind of alienation. Bernard Williams for example accuses the consequentialist of having “one thought too many” by even considering whether to save a relative or a stranger. Now it just so happens that I would save my relative, and I think there are good consequentialist reasons for doing so- consider both the inherent value of friendship and the utilitarian benefits of upholding a culture of caring for one’s loved ones. However, Williams is saying, among other things, that there is something peculiarly alienated about the mentality of the consequentialist, *even if they come to the ‘right’ conclusion*. These things, argues Williams, shouldn’t even be seen as a matter of calculation. To this I would say yes, morality is sometimes alienating, *but who promised you that morality would fit comfortably into your life*? Who promised you that morality would come without sharp edges, that it would never pull you out of your comfortable lifeworld? Force you to put you aside, and view things in a larger scope, maybe even from the point of view of the universe.\n\nBut alienation isn’t the only charge levied at consequentialists as a result of the UPO. A lot of people think consequentialism is disgusting in its willingness to potentially commend anything. I think I detect an element of disgust in Williams, and in the work of others who have criticized consequentialism in a similar vein. This sense of disgust breaks into various components. Consequentialists are seen as grubby, treacherous, ruthless, cold, and unsentimental due to the UPO and similar results. From this “disgust” follows a simple argument. You are a human being, not an abstract moral agent. As a human being, with human sentiments, cognitions, relations and biology you couldn’t live with yourself and have a sense of coherence as a moral being if you were really serious about consequentialism and fully aware of its implications. Ergo, consequentialism is psychologically self-defeating for humans.\n\nNor is giving permission to do terrible things in terrible circumstances the only reason Consequentialism is condemned. I remember, for example, listening to an ethicist - a Catholic virtue ethicist - say that while he disagreed with Kantianism he could at least *respect it*. Consequentialism seemed like frippery to him.\n\nSo to recap, we have three arguments:\n\n1. Consequentialism is *alienated* from simple connections with fellow people because the consequentialist needs to consider all sorts of options under the UPO. This alienation makes consequentialism impossible and damaging to follow as a human being.\n2. Consequentialism is *disgusting* because consequentialists could do anything due to the UPO. No consequentialist can hold their head high, or have a morally positive self-conception, as a result of the UPO. This sense of indecency makes consequentialism psychologically self-defeating for humans.\n3. Consequentialism is fripperous. This makes consequentialism morally damaging for people.\n\nAll of these points together point to the idea that consequentialism isn’t compatible with *being human*. Maybe if there were a super-computer somewhere, looking out for our collective interests, but with no special connections to anyone, we *might* want it to be a certain kind of consequentialist. But it’s not compatible with humanity. However, I want to make the argument here that there is dignity to consequentialism, and that is fully compatible with human existence. I believe consequentialism possesses intrinsic dignity and aesthetic wholeness.\n\nIn part, this can be seen as a continuation of a longstanding project of mine- to argue that there are *aesthetic* problems in philosophy and that we need to resolve them to help give meaningfulness to life. I regard the problems I’m dealing with here not just as ethical problems, but as in part, problems of aesthetic conception- giving a sense of organic unity and dignity to consequentialism. They are also psychological problems.\n\nIt’s important to be clear that I am not resolving the problems it might, at first, look like I am. I am not, for example, defending the UPO on a strictly *ethical* basis. This is, in some sense, as much about morale as anything. I want to ‘frame’ consequentialism in a way that makes it a coherent part of a human’s moral self-conception. I want to show how it fits into an aesthetic conception of your life, its place in the universe, and the moral order. I am not so much arguing it is *right* here as that it possesses *dignity.* This is, I think, necessary, but not sufficient, to show that it is the right outlook for humans to adopt on ethics, because an ethics like consequentialism but without dignity couldn’t recommend its own adoption, and would thus be self-defeating.\n\nWith all that said, let us proceed.\n\n<I’m also going to quote the bible a lot, because my form of consequentialism is crypto-secularist-Christianity, lol. Take that Williams you Nietzschean fucker.>\n\n**B) Taurek, the many and the few- consequentialism and the simple decency of caring about the good by seeking to make more of it**\n\nI’m first going to respond to the charge that consequentialism is in some way cold, ruthless or unsentimental- i.e. that it is disgusting. I will argue, on the contrary, that there is a simple decency to it, and a consequentialist can draw pride from it and live with a coherent moral self-image as a result. I’m going to do this by comparison with an argument by John Taurek.\n\n*\\[To be clear: The pride I am talking about is pride in one’s ethical system- not pride in one’s actions. Even an ill-behaved wretch like me can take pride in the ideals I aspire to, though I fail to live up to them.\\]*\n\nIn 1977, John Taurek wrote a paper: “Should the numbers count”. I find it *disgusting*. I have the same intuitive sense of revulsion towards it that many people have towards consequentialism.\n\nYears before John Taurek wrote his paper, Phillipa Foot imagined the following case. There are five doses of a medicine and six people. All will die without the medicine. However, the sixth person has a slightly different condition and needs a higher dose. So you have two choices:\n\n1. Save five lives\n2. Save one life\n\nFoot asks “is it permissible to save the one life.”\n\nTaurek argues that it is permissible. He argues roughly as follows (thanks to Tyler Doggett in a talk at the University of Sydney for this broad framing, however, any errors are my own).\n\n**P1**. Suppose that you knew and liked the fellow who needed five doses. Suppose he was a friendly acquaintance- but not a close friend. It would be permissible to save him.\n\n**P2**. Merely casually knowing and liking someone is not a basis to save someone at the cost of five other lives.\n\n**C1.** Ergo it can’t be your friendly acquaintanceship that justifies you saving him.\n\n**C2.** But since you are justified in choosing to save him rather than the five (by P1) and since his only specified feature doesn’t justify saving him (by C1), you must be intrinsically justified in choosing to save him, just because.\n\n**C3.** Ergo, it is permissible to choose to save the one not the many.\n\nNow I want to be clear *this is not a reductio absurdum*. My natural instinct would be to read it as such- as a proof that casually knowing someone doesn’t justify saving them, because it leads to the absurd and obviously false conclusion that you may save the one rather than the many. However, Taurek is deadly serious about this. He thinks that you can save the small group or the large group at your pleasure.\n\nI’m sure Taurek was a good man in his personal life and were he still alive I would mean him no ill, nonetheless, I feel obliged to admit that I am revolted by this. I find it sickening.\n\nI can understand, and accept, that someone will save their child, their partner, or even a very close friend rather than a larger group. As I said above, in the right circumstances I might even be able to argue for it on consequentialist grounds. However, I find the idea of someone who would save a casual acquaintance over five strangers, all else being equal, borderline revolting. I would also find the idea of someone who might randomly choose to save one stranger over five revolting, but it’s past even that point, it’s just alien, almost inhuman to me.\n\nWhy do these claims make me so angry, and what does this have to do with the dignity of consequentialism? I think that the fact that consequentialism leaps to the correct answer, in this case, speaks to what gives it dignity. Fundamentally, the problem with Taurek’s attitude is *it does not treat humans as properly valuable.* Now I know that there is sometimes held to be a distinction between *honoring* the value of something (a human life) and *promoting* a certain kind of value, but I think that the most straightforward way to honor the good is to promote it, in this case by protecting as much of it as possible. Getting the right answer here immediately speaks to the simple goodness of consequentialism- good is good, ergo spread the good.\n\nObviously, most non-consequentialists would disagree with Taurek, at least about the claim that you can choose to save a complete stranger over five other complete strangers, and maybe also about the claim that you can choose to save an acquaintance over five strangers. Given that, where is the special dignity of consequentialism, relative to these non-consequentialist views that also disagree with Taurek?\n\nLet me put something a little like a consequentialist version of the one thought too many argument here. What is so commendable about consequentialism here is that *Taurek’s question doesn’t even arise.* There is beauty and dignity in the simple concern the consequentialist has for the welfare of others, and for other good things in the world. The consequentialist gets merit for leaping straight to the right answer. A framework for seeing the world in which Taurek’s and Foot’s question *doesn’t even arise* has much to commend it. On the other hand, any moral framework in which Foot’s question does arise has one thought too many- it lacks the simple, good promoting orientation of consequentialism.\n\nNow my argument here is psychological and aesthetic, so whether I have given enough reasons to believe in the dignity of consequentialism will be a matter of opinion. Some might not see any dignity here at all and what can one say except *de gustibus non est disputandum*? However, it’s enough for me.\n\n**C) Against the world, to save it- Alienation enriches us (in which I ill-advisedly quote the bible a lot to promote a secular ethic)**\n\nHow should we respond to the charge that consequentialism pulls us out of our lives? That it is alienating?\n\nAs Williams put it, Utilitarianism, and by extension, the more pluralistic consequentialism I favor urges us to live *sub specie aeternitatis* (translatable as, in Sidgwick’s phrase, “from the point of the view of the universe”.) Williams says “that \\[*aeternitatis*\\] is not a very good *species* to view it under”\n\nFirst, this isn’t wholly true. Certainly, the fundamental rules might be, in some senses, written *sub specie aeternitatis*, but there are very good reasons why, for most people, most of the time, most decisions are not to be made this way. These reasons are wholly compatible with a belief in consequentialism, as other consequentialists have noted.\n\nGranted though, one will be under that *specie* sometimes in practice. if one is under that *specie*, things may be difficult. You may feel and be alienated from your lifeworld. But I’m not convinced humans live best when shelled wholly in their own lives.\n\nIn the bible we find:\n\n*Wisdom calls out in the street,*\n\n*she lifts her voice in the square;*\n\n*in the main concourse, she cries aloud,*\n\n*at the city gates she makes her speech*\n\nWisdom goes on to, in modern parlance, “call out” the people of the city for their foolishness. Wisdom is at once fully present in the world, willing to speak with everyone, but critical of what she sees there.\n\nAs a consequentialist, I see morality in much the same way as the passage imagines wisdom. Morality stands outside the gate of the city, outside the gates of our lives, those lives so often comfortable in their routines, even if they are utterly miserable. Morality is not the easy continuation of life, morality calls on us to care, to *really* support the good things and really oppose the bad things. To those who say that the consequentialist “thinks one thought too many” or otherwise says that consequentialism is alienated, I’d say *who promised you any of this would be easy*? Why would you expect your experience of morality would never alienate you from yourself, your feelings or your relationships?\n\nBut is alienation compatible with life? There would be something, at best, rather silly about an ethic that can’t be lived, even as it tries to promote and protect lives. But *that which nourishes life is not necessarily that which sits comfortably with life*. We humans have, for a very long time, tried to imbue our lives with transcendent meaning. Those transcendent meanings have not necessarily fit in within our lives, in fact their extension beyond our lives and personal projects, and thus their potential incompatibility with them, *is the point* or at least part of it. The fact that you might be called upon, for example, to give up your own life, places that life in the context of a system of value which makes it more, not less meaningful. It is transcendent not in the sense of an otherworldy ghost, but in the sense of being larger than your own existence, something beyond your struggles great and petty. It does not matter, by the way, whether you think morality flows from reason, or objective ethical truths separate from the world, or if, like me, you think morality is largely a matter of sentiment. This kind of transcendence is compatible with all of those, all that is needed is a larger mission, the source matters little.\n\nSo yes, there is a tension here, but it is a productive tension- the tension between everyday life and the transcendent. Humans have lived with that tension possibly as long as there have been humans.\n\n**D) The re-enchantment of the world**\n\nThe main problem people have today seems to me not to be an addiction to thinking sub specie aeternitatis, but rather the opposite. We are caught in small personal worlds under siege, without any larger conception of the good to form the basis of solidarity and shared demands- to fight back.\n\nConsider the extreme of this anti-alienation position- someone who says that of course ethics would never alienate us from our fundamental projects, of course, ethics wouldn’t require us to get into the muck. This is not a multidimensional and rich view trying to save us from simplistic consequentialism. No, the opposite is true, the total rejection of alienation is a flattening of the world, a disenchantment.\n\nTaking ethics seriously- seriously recognizing the sweeping claims of the good- seeing that we do not live up to them- *is a form of re-enchantment*. It forces us to recognize something outside ourselves, a voice screaming at the gate *help them*. If you’re looking for a progressive alternative to both sterile middle-class modernism and the facile larping of the trads, this is it- it’s very simple. Care for all people and act for a better world.\n\nConsequentialism is, of course, not the only way of taking ethics seriously in this sense I allude to above. Consequentialism is not the only view that will take you out of middle-class habit, or ground your life in a mission larger than itself. However, it gives an almost comically simple charge to *make things better.* That charge rings out to and cuts through so many lies, impasses, and evasions we try to erect to wall in our obligations to the good. For all that people complain that consequentialism can, in theory, justify terrible cruelty, I find in practice it mostly calls for greater generosity and kindness. Of course, I can’t prove consequentialism is the best road in the context of this essay, but these higher demands seem wholly compatible with life.\n\nIs the consequentialist view of things too *demanding* for its adherents to live with themselves? I don’t think so. You’re not a saint. In some sense, you could be a saint. You’ll always be haunted by that, sure, but once again *is this really such a terrible thing to be haunted with*? Do you really want to be without higher aspirations?\n\nIt can hurt like hell. It forces you to gaze at yourself, and see how you’ve failed, to recognize that you could be doing more, but you’re not, because you’re very far from perfect. That’s a good thing. True, we don’t want people wrapped up in extremes of self-indulgent introspection, but neither do we want people who have no sense of something higher to aspire to.\n\nI myself have been through these things I tell. I have severe anxiety and other problems. One of the only things that has kept me going is the sense that I am connected to something larger than myself. This *alienation* or *getting out of my own skin* or viewing things *sub specie aeternitatis* has sustained me. First, you think to yourself, “If I lay dead in a ditch tomorrow, lives would go on” and then you think “how could I make those lives better”. Then you have something to do apart from wallowing- preparing a better world from the point of view of the universe, whether you will be there or not. I can only imagine having no larger point of view within you would be a terrible burden in the dark moments.\n\n**Appendix: a word about family and other intimates**\n\nMaybe this is intrinsically obvious, but I feel like it’s worth spelling it out. The idea of family as a source of moral permissions and obligations can get vicious, quickly. At the talk by Tyler Doggett that inspired this essay, there was a lot of talk about family and consequentialism and how important being partial to one’s family is. I think the nearest and dearest objections to consequentialism are often treated as much more benign than they really are. They are at least in the neighborhood of some very dark phenomena.\n\nI accept that most people if they could save two people or a family member would save a family member. As I said earlier in this essay, I even think, up to a point, it has a consequentialist justification. However, *it only goes so far.* I want you to take very seriously the dangers of unreservedly accepting nearest and dearest arguments.\n\nWhen I used to work in an emergency department, patients were mostly well-behaved. The people most likely to scream at you were relatives. Family can be a bottomless well of moral justification, from which you can draw forth enough water to flood away everything from the principle of turn-taking to the idea that functionaries need to be impartial.\n\nA staple of action fiction, television and films is the idea of drawing an unlimited license to do “whatever you need to do” to protect your family. While fascists ultimately destroy even their own families and often mistreat them in the meantime, fascists’ claims to be overwhelmingly concerned with family are not entirely groundless.\n\nI once saw an argument on Twitter about non-offending pedophiles. “It is not just”, argued the liberal “to contain, let alone execute, people who have not done anything wrong”. The conservative replied thus: “I don’t particularly care whether it’s just or not. I need to protect my kids.”\n\nToo many examples would belabor the point. A logic of family and clan can lead *to very dark places* very quickly*.* This is obvious or should be. Perhaps the fact we have to make this point reflects the relative peace of the post-WWII era. There may come a time in which we don’t have the luxury to treat an overwhelming devotion to family, at the expense of universalized compassion as harmless.\n\n*I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. For I have come to turn*\n\n*a man against his father,*\n\n*a daughter against her mother,*\n\n*a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.*\n\n*A man’s enemies will be the members*\n\n*of his own household.*\n\n**Originally posted on my blog:** [**https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/under-heavens-eyes-for-the-dignity**](https://philosophybear.substack.com/p/under-heavens-eyes-for-the-dignity)",

      "content": " Hey y'all   \n\n\nI am PhD student who only has one publication so far. The one publication came automatically from a presentation at a conference however, so I have never done the traditional journal hunting yet. I've read tips online and talked to my professors, but I am just curious as to what other peoples personal tips are when it comes to choosing journals to send your paper to.   \n\n\nThanks!",

      "content": "I wanted to throw an idea I briefly discuss in my (draft) thesis for discussion.\n\nA young Putnam once gave an argument for scientific realism that only scientific realism can explain *our practical reliance on science*. In particular, he was disturbed by what he saw as the anti-realist implications of Popper's approach the philosophy of science, in which we have no reason to believe our best theories. Such a theory, he argued, cannot explain our reliance on science, much of which is practical.  Popper's view, according to Putnam, was exactly the kind of mistaken view of science that comes from not recognising the integration of science into human praxis.\n\nI have a slightly different argument. Suppose, for the sake of argument, that anti-realists were able to explain how it is we rely on science to make predictions about experience. I think there is still a kind of reliance on scientific knowledge they can't explain.\n\nConsider a scientist working on animal consciousness, whose work is used to inform debates about animal welfare, the ethics of experimenting on animals and so on. Even if the scientific anti-realist can explain why we trust this scientist's *predictions about observations* to be fulfilled, the scientific anti-realist cannot, at least prima-facie, explain our reliance on science to help us make ethical judgements involving things which are not directly observed, like animal consciousness.",

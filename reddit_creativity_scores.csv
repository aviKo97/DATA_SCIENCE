"Funny you should ask.   After playing for 25 years now I can honestly say I just played the best acoustic guitar I‚Äôve ever experienced just yesterday. I dropped my electric off at a local luthier to get some new pickups installed and he had a couple [McPherson Carbon Fiber](https://mcphersonguitars.com/carbon-series/sable/) guitars on display, which I asked to play.   My friends, I was flabbergasted. I had never heard of an entire guitar made of carbon fiber, but my God. It felt so incredibly solid, yet it was still delightfully light. It was rich and harmonic, warm and clear. And so easy to play. I felt myself making little mistakes that would have been dead notes on my acoustic at home but they somehow still rang out on this one. I‚Äôve played Martin‚Äôs, Gibson‚Äôs, Taylor‚Äôs etc. This one blew them all away.

"Strangely enough, I have met a few magic guitars in my life. I still own a couple. Wish I kept them all. I won't include anything super rare that Ive played. Because those were never owned by me. Like a 59 Les Paul...a real one. I'll just post things I had real time with.    1. 50's Gibson Les Paul Tribute 2010 model: This guitar was amazing. It sounded great for both bands I was playing in. One was blues rock, another was metal! It covered all of that. Stayed in tune perfectly. Sustained amazingly. I sold it, and shouldn't have.    2. Ibanez 927BK: This was the first year Ibanez did the ""Premium"" line. I put DiMarzio Evo 7 string pickups in it. This guitar was unbelievable. It was perfect in every way. Sold it because ""I won't play metal anymore"". Yeah, right.     3. PRS S2 USA Custom 24: This was the first year they did the S2 line from the USA plant. It played itself. Never had to work on it. I traded this guitar for the Gibson mentioned above! Lol.    4. Schecter Hellraiser FRS 2009: This is my current #1. Changed The bridge pickup to an EMG 67. This guitar has a bulit in sustainer, but I rarely use it. It SINGS. I will never get rid of this guitar. I've learned my lesson.    5. PRS Wood Library Paul's Guitar: I don't know what they did to this guitar, but it was amazing. I would've kept it if it had a Trem.     6. Schecter E1 Koa: This is another that I will never sell, because it's the closest thing to the Les Paul above that I have ever came across. It has a fat 50s neck, and it plays beautifully. The Custom Shop pickups are based on Anderson Super Rock pickups, from when he worked at Schecter. Amazing instrument. It was a B Stock because of some scratches.
